She served as [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister of Ceylon and Sri Lanka]] three times, 1960\u201365, 1970\u201377 and 1994\u20132000, and was a long-time leader of the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]].\n\nBandaranaike was the widow of a previous Sri Lankan prime minister, [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike|Solomon Bandaranaike]], and the mother of Sri Lanka's fourth Executive [[President of Sri Lanka|President]], [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]], as well as [[Anura Bandaranaike]], former speaker and cabinet minister.<ref name=\"Sirimavo-britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9012125/Sirimavo-RD-Bandaranaike|title=Sirimavo R.D. Bandaranaike (prime minister of Sri Lanka)|publisher=BRITANNICA-Online}}</ref><ref name=\"Sirimavo-BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/964914.stm|title=Sirimavo Bandaranaike: First woman premier|publisher=BBC News|date=10 October 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nSirimavo Bandaranaike was born on 17 April 1916, as Sirima Ratwatte to a prominent [[Radala]] family, who were descended from Ratwatte Dissawa, [[Dissawa]] of [[Matale]], a signatory on behalf of the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] to the [[Kandyan Convention|Kandyan Convention of 1815]]. Born to [[Barnes Ratwatte]], [[Dissawa]] of [[Sabaragamuwa]] and Rosalind Mahawelatenne Kumarihamy of Mahawelatenne [[Walauwa]], Balangoda, she was the eldest of six, with four brothers and one sister. Her father was member of the [[State Council of Ceylon|State Council]] and the [[Senate of Ceylon]]. Her brothers were [[Justice]] [[Barnes Ratwatte II]], Dr Seevali Ratwatte, Dr Mackie Ratwatte (who served as her Private Security during her premiership) and [[Clifford Ratwatte]], former Member of Parliament for Balangoda and Chairman of the State Plantations and Sri Lanka Tea Board. Her youngest sister Patsy Ratwatte was married to [[Colonel]] Edward James Divitotawela, who established the [[111 Brigade (Sri Lanka)|Central Command]] of the [[Ceylon Army]].\n\nBandaranaike was educated at [[St Bridget's Convent, Colombo]], but was a practising [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]. In 1940 she married [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike|Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike]], a member of the [[State Council of Ceylon|State council]] and son of Sir [[Solomon Dias Bandaranaike]], the [[Sri Lankan Mudaliyars|Maha Mudaliyar]] (chief native interpreter and advisor to the Governor). They had three children, [[Sunethra Bandaranaike|Sunethra]], [[Chandrika Kumaratunga|Chandrika]], and [[Anura Bandaranaike|Anura]].\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Husband's premiership===\nHer husband Solomon was a founding member of the [[United National Party]] (UNP) in 1946 and was elected to the House of Representatives (elected lower house of Parliament) in the first elections of the Dominion of Ceylon in 1947. Breaking away from the UNP he went on to form the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (SLFP) and became its leader.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51488/SWRD-Bandaranaike S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Prime minister of Sri Lanka]</ref> A coalition led by the SLFP won a majority in the House of Representatives in [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1956|1956 general election]] and Solomon became Prime Minister. After initiating much change on socialist and nationalistic lines, he had his tenure cut short three years later when he was assassinated by a Buddhist monk on 26 September 1959. The assassination created a power vacuum, due to Solomon's likely successor C. P. de Silva (leader of the House of Representatives and Finance Minister) being gravely ill and in London for treatment at the time. [[Wijeyananda Dahanayake]], Minister of Education, was appointed caretaker Prime Minister. Turmoil in the government followed as Dahanayake sacked and appointed ministers. This led to a defeat of the SLFP in the [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, March 1960|March 1960 elections]].\n\n===First term===\nDuring this time Sirimavo was brought forward as legitimate successor to her husband's party leadership and she entered politics. In 1960 M. P. de Zoysa Jnr stepped down from his seat in the [[Senate of Ceylon|Senate]] (appointed upper house of Parliament) paving the way for Sirimavo to be appointed as a member of the Senate from the SLFP. She led her party to win the [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, July 1960|July 1960 elections]] on the pledge to continue her husband's policies, notably the [[Sinhala Only Act]], and to proceed with repatriation of the estate Tamils to India. On 21 July 1960, as a Senator she became prime minister, thus becoming the first female prime minister in the world.<ref name=bbcotd>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/20/newsid_2784000/2784527.stm 1960: Ceylon chooses world's first woman PM], OnThisDay BBC, Retrieved 21 July 2016</ref>\n\nKnown to her fellow Sri Lankans as \"Mrs. B,\" she could skillfully use appeals to the electorates as she promised to continue her assassinated husband's work. Her opponents and critics called her the \"weeping widow\",<ref name=bbcotd/> saying she got herself nominated a Senator and made head of her husband's party after his death by making capital out of his death, going around to different villages and weeping over their children.\n\nBandaranaike was a socialist who continued her husband's policies of nationalizing key sectors of the economy, such as banking and insurance, and also nationalizing all schools then owned by the Roman Catholic Church in 1961.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872330,00.html Sinhala Without Tears], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 5 May 1961</ref> Bandaranaike was on a roller-coaster ride from the moment she took office. Within a year of her 1960 election victory she declared a \"state of emergency\". This followed a [[civil disobedience]] campaign by part of the country's minority [[Tamil people|Tamil]] population who were outraged by her decision to drop English as an official language and her order to conduct all government business in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], the language of the majority [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]]. This they considered a highly discriminatory act and an attempt to deny Tamils access to all official posts and the law. This led to an increase in Tamil militancy which escalated under succeeding administrations.\n\nFurther problems arose with the state takeover of foreign businesses, particularly petroleum companies, which upset the United States and Britain; they ended aid to Sri Lanka. As a result, Bandaranaike moved her country closer to China and the [[Soviet Union]] and championed a policy of nonalignment. At home, she crushed an [[1962 Ceylonese coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted military coup]] by Christian officers in 1962 and appointed her uncle [[William Gopallawa]] [[Governor-General of Ceylon]]. In 1964, she entered into a historic coalition with the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] (LSSP). At the end of 1964, she lost a [[vote of confidence]]. The SLFP coalition was defeated in the [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1965|1965 elections]], ending her first term as Prime Minister.\n[[File:Tissa with Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike in Russia with Alexei Kosygin Premier of the Soviet Union fro.jpg|thumb|left|250px||Sirimavo Bandaranaike with Soviet Union Prime Minister [[Alexei Kosygin]], [[Tissa Wijeyeratne]] and [[Anura Bandaranaike]]]]\n\n===Pact with India===\n\nUnder the terms of the 1964 agreement with India, 600,000 Indian Tamils were to be repatriated, while 375,000 were to be granted Sri Lankan citizenship. By 31 October 1981, when the two countries were to have settled this issue, India had taken more than 300,000 persons as repatriates. Sri Lanka had granted citizenship to over 185,000 plus over 62,000 post-1964 offspring. Over 207,000 Indian Tamils in Sri Lanka before 1964, plus nearly 45,000 offspring, were granted Indian citizenship but still awaited repatriation. In the wake of the July 1983 anti-Tamil violence, some in this latter group are being processed for repatriation or have emigrated to India.\n\nWith the lapse of the 1964 agreement India declined to consider any more applications for citizenship. The government of Sri Lanka believes that the 1964 pact remains in force until the citizenship cases and permanent residence of all Indian Tamils covered by the pact have been settled. The All-Party Conference has agreed that the government should grant Sri Lankan citizenship to stateless Indian Tamils who did not apply for Indian citizenship and were not granted Sri Lankan citizenship under the 1964 agreement.{{cn|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Second term===\nShe regained power after the [[United Front (Sri Lanka)|United Front]] coalition (SLFP, LSSP, and the [[Communist Party of Sri Lanka|Communists]]) won the [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1970|1970 elections]] with a large majority. But after just 16 months in power, the government was almost toppled by the [[1971 JVP Insurrection (Sri Lanka)|1971 JVP Insurrection]] of left-wing youths. Bandaranaike had disbanded the government's intelligence service, suspecting that it was loyal to the opposition [[United National Party]] (UNP). Thus there was no warning of the uprising, and [[Sri Lanka Army|Sri Lanka's small army]] was caught off guard. The army mobilized its reserves and held the capital, but some outlying areas were occupied by the insurgents. The government was saved by military aid from both [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], thanks to Bandaranaike's skillful foreign policy. In those tough political years, she turned herself into a formidable leader. ''\"She was the only man in her cabinet\"'', one of her officials commented during the height of the insurgency.\n\nHer second term saw a new constitution introduced in 1972, replacing the [[Soulbury constitution]]. Ceylon was renamed Sri Lanka and became a republic. The 1973 oil crisis had a traumatic effect on the Sri Lankan economy: the government had no access to Western aid and her socialist policies stifled economic activity. Rationing had to be imposed. Bandaranaike became more and more intolerant of criticism and forced the shut-down of the Independent newspaper group, whose publications were her fiercest critics. Earlier she had nationalized the country's largest newspaper, ''Lake House'', which has remained the government's official mouthpiece. Bandaranaike enjoyed continued success in foreign affairs. She was chosen chairwoman of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1976, and hosted the Movement's conference, attended by numerous heads of state. Despite her high international standing, she was losing Sri Lankan support rapidly amid allegations of corruption and against the background of a rapidly declining economy.\n\nUnder the Soulbury constitution, election would have been held in 1975. However, the government had become very unpopular. Bandaranaike used a clause of the 1972 constitution to delay elections until 1977. This did not help and in the 1977 elections the United Front was routed, winning only 8 seats.\n\n===Opposition===\nBandaranaike held her own seat in 1977, but in 1980, she was charged with abuse of power for the 1975\u201377 delay in elections. She was expelled from parliament and banned from public office for seven years.The 1980s were her dark days. She became a political outcast, rejected by the people who had once worshipped her. Bandaranaike spent the next seventeen years in opposition warding off challenges to her leadership of the SLFP, even from her own children. Always the politician, she played her ambitious daughter [[Chandrika Kumaratunga|Chandrika]] and son [[Anura Bandaranaike|Anura]] against one another, holding on to party control despite losing every subsequent general election.\n\n===Third term===\nIn 1994, the [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|SLFP-led coalition]] won the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 1994|general elections]].  Chandrika then outmanoeuvred her mother to become prime minister; and then was elected [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] the same year.\n\nBandaranaike became prime minister again, but the constitution had changed since her last tenure. As prime minister she was now subordinate to her daughter, the President. She remained in office till a few months before her death, but had little real power. She died on Election Day, 10 October 2000, after having cast her vote for the last time.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of political families in Sri Lanka]]\n*[[Attempted military coup in Ceylon, 1962]]\n*[[Bandaranaike family]]\n* Skard, Torild (2014) \"Sirimavo Bandaranaike\".

She continued to raise her voice against the human rights violations of the Zia r\u00e9gime, and addressed the [[European Parliament]] in Strasbourg in 1985.

Over time, Bhutto quietly isolated MQM from power,  later ousting them to establish a single-party government that claimed a mandate from all of Pakistan. The effects of [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Zia's domestic policies]] began to reveal themselves, and she found them difficult to counter.

Because of the semi-presidential system, Bhutto needed permission from Khan to impose new policies. Khan vetoed many, as he felt they contradicted his point of view. Bhutto, through her legislators, also attempted to shift to a [[parliamentary democracy]] from the semi-presidential system, but Khan always used his constitutional powers to veto Bhutto's attempts.<ref name=Lieven250>{{cite book|last=Lieven|first=Anatol|title=Pakistan: A Hard Country \u00a7The President-Prime minister dilemma|year=2010|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-61039-021-7|page=250|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fEZt49MVZIAC&pg=PA238&dq=Bhutto+Pakistan+A+Hard+country#v=onepage&q&f=true}}</ref>\n\nTales of corruption in public-sector industries began to surface, which undermined the credibility of Bhutto.

General Abdul Waheed was an uptight, strict, and a professional officer with a views of Westernized democracy. Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan]] as Chief of Naval Staff; General [[Abbas Khattak]] as Chief of Air Staff. Whilst, Air Chief Marshal [[Farooq Feroze Khan]] was appointed chairman Joint Chiefs who was the first (and to date only) Pakistani [[air officer]] to have reached to such [[4-star rank|4 star]] assignment. Benazir Bhutto enjoyed a strong relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and President who was hand-picked by her did not questioned her authority. She hand-picked officers and promoted them based on their pro-democracy views while the puppet President gave constitutional authorisation for their promotion. The senior military leadership including [[Jehangir Karamat]], Musharraf, Kayani, [[Ali Kuli Khan]], Farooq Feroze Khan, Abbas Khattak and [[Fasih Bokhari]], had strong Western-democratic views, and were generally close to Bhutto as they had resisted Nawaz Sharif's conservatism.

Benazir Bhutto ordered General Abdul Waheed Kakar and the Lieutenant-General [[Javed Ashraf Qazi]] director-general of [[ISI (Pakistan)|ISI]], to start a sting and manhunt operation to hunt down the ringmaster, [[Ramzi Yousef]]. After few arrests and intensive manhunt search, the ''ISI'' finally captured Ramzi before he could flew the country. In matter of weeks, Ramzi was secretly extradited to the United States, while the ''ISI'' managed to kill or apprehend all the culprits behind the plot.

During this course, General Rana directly reported to the prime minister, and led the intelligence operations after which were approved by Benazir Bhutto. In 1995, Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Mansurul Haq]] as the Chief of Naval Staff, as the Admiral had personal contacts with the Benazir's family.

The culprit and ringleader of the coup was a junior level officer, Major-General [[Zahirul Islam Abbasi]], who had radical views. Others included Brigadier-Generals Mustansir Billa, and Qari Saifullah of Pakistan Army. The secret ISI learned of this plot and tipped off the Pakistan Army and at midnight before the coup could take place, it was thwarted. The coup was exposed by Ali Kuli Khan, the [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|Military Intelligence]] chief, and Jehangir Karamat, [[Chief of General Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of General Staff]]. The Military Intelligence led the arrest of 36 army officers and 20 civilians in Rawalpindi; General Ali Kuli Khan reported to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto early morning and submitted his report on the coup. After learning this, Benazir was angered and dismayed, therefore a full-fledged running court martial was formed by Benazir Bhutto. Prime Minister Benazir issued arrests of numbers of religiously conservatives leaders and therefore denied the amnesty and clemency calls made by the Army officers. By 1996, all of the dissident officers were either jailed or shot dead by the Pakistan Army and a report was submitted to the Prime minister. General Kuli Khan and General Karamat received wide appreciation from the prime minister and were decorated with the civilian decorations and award by her.\n\n===Death of younger brother===\n\nIn 1996, the Bhutto family suffered another tragedy in Sindh Province, Benazir Bhutto's stronghold and political rival. [[Murtaza Bhutto]], Benazir's younger brother, was controversially and publicly shot down in a police encounter in Karachi. Since 1989, Murtaza and Benazir had a series of disagreements regarding the PPP's policies and Murtaza's opposition towards Benazir's [[Operation Clean-up|operations]] against the Urdu-speaking class. Murtaza also developed serious disagreement with Benazir's husband, Zardari, and unsuccessfully attempted to remove his influence in the government. Benazir and Murtaza's mother, Nusrat, sided with Murtaza which also dismayed the daughter. In a controversial interview, Benazir declared that Pakistan only needed one Bhutto, not two, though she denied giving or passing any comments. Her younger brother increasingly made it difficult for her to run the government after he raised voices against Benazir's alleged corruption. Alone in Sindh, Benazir lost the support of the province to her younger brother. At the political campaign, Murtaza demanded party elections inside the PPP, which according to Zardari, Benazir would have lost due to Nusrat backing Murtaza and many workers inside the party being willing to see Murtaza as the country's Prime minister as well as the chair of the party. More problems arose when Abdullah Shah Lakiyari, [[Chief Minister of Sindh]], and allegedly her spouse created disturbances in Murtaza's political campaign. On 20 September 1996, in a controversial police encounter, Murtaza Bhutto was shot dead near his residence along with six other party activists. As the news reached all of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto hurriedly returned to Karachi, and an emergency was proclaimed in the entire province. Benazir Bhutto's limo was stoned by angered PPP members when she tried to visit Murtaza's funeral ceremonies.<ref name=Lieven449/> Her brother's death had crushed their mother, and she was immediately admitted to the local hospital after learning that her son had been killed.<ref name=beaver/> At Murtaza's funeral, Nusrat accused Benazir and Zardari of being responsible, and vowed to pursue prosecution.<ref name=beaver>{{cite news |title=Bhutto's brother dies in shooting |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S5JUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YTsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4955,4903862&dq=zardari&hl=en |newspaper=Beaver County Times |location=Beaver, Pennsylvania |date=22 September 1996 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=nyarrest>{{cite news|last=Burns |first=John F |title=Pakistan's Premier Bhutto is put under house arrest |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 November 1996 |accessdate=5 March 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/05/world/Pakistan-s-premier-bhutto-is-put-under-house-arrest.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110218203009/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/05/world/pakistan-s-premier-bhutto-is-put-under-house-arrest.html |archivedate=18 February 2011 }}</ref><ref name=nyarrest2>{{cite news|last=Burns |first=John F |title=With goats and gunfire, Pakistanis cheer Bhutto's fall |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 November 1996 |accessdate=5 March 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/world/with-goats-and-gunfire-Pakistanis-cheer-bhutto-s-fall.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130506183106/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/world/with-goats-and-gunfire-Pakistanis-cheer-bhutto-s-fall.html |archivedate=6 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\nPresident Farooq Leghari, who dismissed the Bhutto government seven weeks after Murtaza's death, also suspected Benazir and Zardari's involvement.<ref name=nyarrest/> Several of Pakistan's leading newspapers alleged that Zardari wanted his brother-in-law out of the way because of Murtaza's activities as head of a breakaway faction of the PPP.<ref name=nyarrest/> In all, after this incident, Benazir Bhutto lost all support from Sindh Province.

Soon after the death of her younger brother, Bhutto widely became unpopular and public opinion turned against her government. In Sindh, Bhutto lost all the support from the powerful feudal lords and the political spectrum turned against her. In 1996, the major civil\u2013military scandal became internationally and nationally known when her spouse Zardari was linked with then-navy chief and former Admiral Mansurul Haq. Known as [[Agosta class submarine|Agosta class scandal]], many of higher naval admirals and government officials of both French and Pakistan governments were accused of getting heavy commissions while the deal was disclosed to sell this sensitive submarine technology to Pakistan Navy.<ref name=NationBooks>{{cite book|last=Bhutto|first=Fatima|title=Songs of Blood and Sword: A daughter's memoir|year=2010|publisher=Nation Books|location=Washington D.C. |isbn=978-1-56858-632-8|pages=443\u2013470|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjo3xkGSV6cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Story+of+Pakistan+book&hl=en&ei=lGynTq6WNrH8iQK0nJSzDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CDUQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&q=Story%20of%20Pakistan%20book&f=false}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 July 1996, Qazi Hussain Ahmed of Jamaat e Islami announced to start protests against government alleging corruption.

On 4 November 1996, Bhutto's government was dismissed by President Leghari primarily because of corruption and Murtaza's death,<ref name=nyarrest/> who used the Eighth Amendment discretionary powers to dissolve the government. Benazir was surprised when she discovered that it was not the military who had dismissed her but her own hand-picked puppet President who had used the power to dismiss her. She turned to the Supreme Court hoping for gaining Leghari's actions unconstitutional. But the Supreme Court justified and affirmed President Leghari's dismissal in a 6\u20131 ruling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/jan/01-30-97/news/news7.html|title=Pakistan Supreme Court Upholds Benazir Bhutto's Dismissal on the basis of Corruption and Extra-Judicial Killings of MQM Workers and Supporters|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091014070145/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/jan/01-30-97/news/news7.html|archivedate=14 October 2009 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Many military leaders who were close to Prime minister rather than the President, did not wanted Benazir Bhutto's government to fall, as they resisted the Nawaz Sharif's conservatism.<ref name=Mazhar/> When President Leghari, through public media, discovered that General Kakar (Chief of Army Staff), General Khattak (Chief of Air Staff), and Admiral Haq (Chief of Naval Staff) had been backing Benazir to come back in the government; President Leghari aggressively responded by dismissing the entire military leadership by bringing the pro-western democracy views but neutral military leadership that would supervise the upcoming elections. This was the move that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (elected in 1997) did repeat in 1999, when Nawaz Sharif had deposed General Jehangir Karamat after developing serious disagreements on the issues of national security.\n\nCriticism against Benazir Bhutto came from the powerful political spectrum of the [[Punjab Province (Pakistan)|Punjab Province]] and the [[Azad Kashmir|Kashmir Province]] who opposed Benazir Bhutto, particularly the nationalisation issue that led the lost of Punjab's privatised industries under the hands of her government. Bhutto blamed this opposition for the destabilisation of Pakistan.<ref name=NationBooks /> Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Jehangir Karamat at one point intervened in the conflict between President and the Prime Minister, and urged Benazir Bhutto to focus on [[good governance]] and her ambitious programme of making the country into a [[welfare state]], but the misconduct of her cabinet ministers continued and the corruption which she was unable to struck it down with a full force.

Faced with serious charges by the Nawaz Sharif's government, Bhutto flew to Dubai with her three young children while her spouse was thrown in jail. Shortly after rising to power in a 1999 military coup, General Pervez Musharraf characterized Bhutto's terms as an \"era of sham democracy\" and others characterized her terms a period of corrupt, failed governments.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/13/AR2008011303447.html Many Pakistanis See Leader As Having Reigned Too Long] 14 January 2008</ref>\n\n==Second term as leader of the opposition, 1996\u201399==\n\nBenazir Bhutto faced wide public disapproval after the corruption cases became public public, and this was clearly seen in Bhutto's defeat in the [[Pakistani general election, 1997|1997 parliamentary elections]]. Bhutto left for Dubai soon afterwards taking her three children with her, while her husband was set for trial.<ref name=Guardian/>\n\nBhutto acted as Leader of the Opposition despite living in Dubai, and worked to enhance her public image while supporting public reforms. In 1998, soon after India's [[Pokhran-II]] nuclear tests, Bhutto publicly called for Pakistan to begin its own nuclear testing programme, rallying and pressuring Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to make this decision. Bhutto learned from sources close to Sharif that he was reluctant to carry out nuclear testing. Therefore, she felt, her public call to test should increase her popularity. However, the strategy backfired\u2014Nawaz indeed authorised and ordered the scientists from PAEC{{who|date=May 2016}} and [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]] to perform the tests.  <!-- not sure what this is saying, need to consult reference: A wide range of approvals of these tests was conceived by the Prime Minister; the public image and prestige of Nawaz Sharif was at its peak point.<ref name=Hoodboy>{{cite web|last=Hoodbhoy |first=Pervez Amerali|title=Pakistan's nuclear bayonet|work=Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy, professor of nuclear physics|publisher=Hoodboy}}</ref> --> It was another political setback for Bhutto and her image gradually declined in 1998.<ref name=Guardian/>\n\nHowever, 1999 would brought dramatic changes for Bhutto as well as the entire country. Bhutto criticized Sharif for violating the Armed Forces's code of conduct when he illegally appointed General Pervez Musharraf as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee.

However, all this changed when Pakistan became enmeshed with an unpopular and [[undeclared war]] with India.

Two Indian Air Force [[MiG-21]] fighters shot down a [[Pakistani Navy]] reconnaissance plane, killing 16 naval officers. Bhutto criticised Sharif for having failed to gather any support from the navy. The Armed Forces began to criticise the prime minister for causing the military disasters. Bhutto's approval ratings were favourable and the Armed Forces chiefs remained sympathetic towards Bhutto as she continued to criticise the now-unpopular Sharif.<ref name=Lieven449/>\n\nBhutto was highly confident that her party would secure an overwhelming victory in the coming Senate elections in 1999, due to the prime minister's widening widening unpopularity. Controversially, when the Pakistani armed forced initiated a coup d'\u00e9tat, Bhutto neither criticised nor issued any comment, remaining silent on supporting General Musharraf, as Dalrymple notes.<ref name=Guardian/> She continued to support Musharraf's coordinated arrests of the supporters and staff of Sharif. Musharraf destroyed Sharif's political presence in Sindh and Kashmir provinces{{how|date=May 2016}}. <!-- because it was stop supporting him or face imprisonment I guess? --> Many political offices in Sharif's constituency or district were forcibly closed and many sympathisers were jailed. In 2002, Bhutto and the MQM made a side-line deal with Musharraf that allows both to continue underground political activities in Sindh and Kashmir, and to fill the gap after Musharraf had destroyed Sharif's presence in the both provinces. The effects of the arrests was seen clearly in the [[Pakistani general election, 2008|2008 parliamentary elections]], when Nawaz Sharif failed to secure support back in those two provinces.<ref name=Lieven449/>\n\n==Charges of corruption==\n\nAfter President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Bhutto's first government on 6 August 1990 because of corruption allegations, the government of Pakistan directed its intelligence agencies to investigate. Nawaz Sharif became prime minister in the ensuing elections and intensified prosecution investigation of Bhutto. Pakistani embassies through western Europe\u2014in France, Switzerland, Spain, Poland and Britain\u2014were directed to investigate. Bhutto and her husband Zardari faced several legal proceedings, including a charge in Switzerland of money-landering through [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss banks]]. While never convicted, Zardari spent eight years in prison on similar corruption charges.

The PMLQ consisted of those who were initially part of Sharif's party but then switched to Musharraf to avoid persecution and jail. 2000 brought positive change for Bhutto, who became widely unpopular in Pakistan in 1996.\n\nIn the 2000s, following the declassification of the [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission]] papers and other secret documents from the 1970s, Bhutto's support in Pakistan began to grow. Her image became more positive and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] seemed likely to return to government, perhaps as soon the [[Pakistani general election, 2002|2002 elections]]. Amid fears of Bhutto's return, a threatened Musharraf released from imprisonment many members of the liberal-secular force MQM who had held beeb as political prisoners. Musharraf saw MQM as a vital political weapon to stave off and hold back the PPP. But MQM support was limited to Karachi at the time, and very lacking in the urban areas of Sindh, which remained a critical electoral threat for Musharraf. Therefore, in 2002 President Musharraf amended Pakistan's constitution to ban prime ministers from serving more than two terms. This disqualified Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif from holding the office again and was widely considered to attack them directly.\n\nWhile she lived in [[Dubai]] Bhutto cared for her three children and her mother, who suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]].

This and subsequent support for Musharraf led Elder Bhutto's comrades like Khar to criticise her publicly.

She spent most of her career in the Senegalese administration of justice. She was successively Deputy Public Prosecutor, judge and first vice President of the Regional First Class Court of Dakar and chamber President of the Court of Appeal. She was a founder and the first woman president of the Association of Senegalese Lawyers from 1975 to 1990,<ref name=JA/> then became the Director of Engagements for the [[West African Banking Company]] (''Compagnie bancaire de l'Afrique Occidentale'', CBAO) from September 1990 to April 2000.<ref name=Who>\"Who's Who\", ''Senegal: Les Hommes de Pouvoir'', number 5, [http://www.africaintelligence.fr Africa Intelligence], 17 July 2001 {{fr icon}}.</ref> Boye was also vice president of the International Federation of Women Lawyers from 1978 to 1998. She was respected as a serious professional, intelligent and honest. She was a militant feminist, Muslim and divorced with two children. Her relations with the regime of President [[Abdou Diouf]] were strained and she did not accept high positions in the judicial system to preserve her integrity and independence.<ref>Skard, Torild (2014) \"Mame Madior Boye\" in ''Women of power - half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, ISBN 978-1-44731-578-0</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister==\n\nFollowing the victory of [[Abdoulaye Wade]] in the [[Senegalese presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], Boye became Minister of Justice in April 2000.<ref name=Who/><ref>[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=86&art_id=qw954826144823B252 \"New Senegalese government in place\"], AFP, April 4, 2000.</ref> But tensions arose between the President and the Prime Minister, who was from another political party. [[Moustapha Niasse]] resigned and Boye was appointed by Wade as Prime Minister on 3 March 2001, two months before the legislative elections. Wade lacked a majority in the legislature and more than 30 non-partisan women's organizations organized a campaign before the elections demanding more women in the legislature. Boye was not only a woman, she was also non-partisan, which looked good.<ref>Diadie Ba, [http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=86&art_id=qw983693102588B252 \"Senegal's first woman premier appointed\"], Reuters, March 4, 2001.</ref> She remained as Minister of Justice in the new government.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1203435.stm \"Senegal cabinet reshuffle removes Niasse supporters\"], BBC News, March 5, 2001.</ref> The elections gave Wade a large majority - 89 of 120 seats. The representation of women increased, but not to more than 19 per cent. Following the [[legislative elections, 2001|April 2001 legislative elections]], Boye was reappointed as Prime Minister on 10 May 2001; she was, however, replaced as Minister of Justice in the government appointed on 12 May.<ref>[http://www.presse-francophone.org/agence/archivesmois/politique/polmai2001.htm \"Le deuxi\u00e8me gouvernement de Mme Mame Madior Boye\"], UPF, 14 May 2001 {{fr icon}}.</ref><ref>Skard (2014)</ref>\n\nIn Boye's second government there were five women of 25 ministers, against two previously. This was a nice victory for Boye. But the government faced considerable economic and social challenges. Efforts were made to strengthen education and health, improve salaries, reduce unemployment among the young and support the agriculture sector. But the ministers were new and inexperienced and views in the coalition differed. As Prime Minister Boye was subordinate to the President, and Wade was a hand-on, dynamic leader with clear authoritarian tendencies<ref>Skard (2014), pp. 294-7</ref> Boye and her government were dismissed by the President on 4 November 2002, reportedly due to her reaction to the [[MV Joola|MV ''Joola'']] sea disaster in September 2002.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=35577 \"Report blames army for delay in Joola rescue\"], IRIN, November 6, 2002.</ref> It was one of the worst shipping disasters of all times. More than 1 800 people died when the state-owned ferry sank. Boye stated that the accident was due to the weather, thus excluding failures of ship and crew. But soon there were allegations of high-level errors. The head of the navy was dismissed and two ministers had to resign.<ref>Skard (2014), p. 296</ref>  \n\n==Afterwards==\n\nLater, in September 2004, Boye was appointed by [[Alpha Oumar Konar\u00e9]] as the [[African Union]]'s Special Representative for the promotion of the protection of civilians in armed conflicts.<ref>[http://www.africa-union.org/News_Events/Press_Releases/86%2004%20AU%20Special%20Representative.pdf African Union Press Release No. 086/2004], September 7, 2004.</ref>\n\nOn 12 September 2008, a judge in [[France]] issued an arrest warrant for Boye, along with eight others, in connection with the [[MV Le Joola|''Joola'' disaster]].<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hJYkL0FyVKzQX81BQIRmZWhais_g \"French judge issues warrants over Senegal ferry disaster: lawyer\"], AFP, 12 September 2008.</ref> The Senegalese government rejected this and, in response, decided to prosecute the judge who issued the warrants.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j-sPhLA9zs_Zd5fPIZIiGjvZ-G1g \"Senegal to prosecute French judge over ferry disaster\"], AFP, 19 September 2008.</ref> The [[Paris Court of Appeal]] annulled the arrest warrant for Boye in mid-June 2009.<ref>Malick Ciss, [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200906170298.html \"Dossier du naufrage du bateau \u00ab Le Joola \u00bb - les mandats d'arr\u00eat internationaux contre mame madior boye et cie annul\u00e9s\"], ''Le Soleil'', 17 June 2009 {{fr icon}}.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Moustapha Niasse]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Prime Minister of Senegal]]|years=2001\u20132002}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Idrissa Seck]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{SenegalPMs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boye, Mame Madior}}\n[[Category:1940 births]]\n[[Category:Female heads of government]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Saint-Louis, Senegal]]\n[[Category:Senegalese Democratic Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Senegalese women in politics]]\n[[Category:Women prime ministers]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Senegal]]\n[[Category:Female defence ministers]]"}]},"38335762":{"pageid":38335762,"ns":0,"title":"Alenka Bratu\u0161ek"},"13171":{"pageid":13171,"ns":0,"title":"Gro Harlem Brundtland","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n|name         = Gro Harlem Brundtland\n|image        = Brundtland.jpg|150px\n|office       = [[Prime Minister of Norway]]\n|monarch      = [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]]<br>[[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]]\n|term_start   = 3 November 1990\n|term_end     = 25 October 1996<br/><small>({{Age in years and days|1990|11|3|1996|10|25}})</small>\n|predecessor  = [[Jan P.

She is also known for having chaired the [[Brundtland Commission]] which presented the [[Our Common Future|Brundtland Report]] on [[sustainable development]].\n\nEducated as a physician, Brundtland joined the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] and entered the government in 1974 as [[Minister of Climate and the Environment|Minister of the Environment]]. From 1981 to 1992 she was leader of the Labour Party. After her surprise resignation as Prime Minister in 1996, she became an international leader in [[sustainable development]] and [[public health]], and served as Director-General of the World Health Organization and as a UN [[Special Envoy on Climate Change]] from 2007.<ref name=UN07b>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.un.org/climatechange/2007highlevel/envoys.shtml\n|title=UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Appoints Special Envoys on Climate Change\n|publisher=[[United Nations]]\n|year=2007\n|accessdate=2007-08-03\n}}</ref> She is also deputy chair of [[The Elders (organization)|The Elders]] and a former Vice-President of the [[Socialist International]]. Brundtland received the 1994 [[Charlemagne Prize]], and has received many other awards and recognitions.\n\n==Early life==\nBrundtland was born in [[Oslo]] in 1939, the daughter of physician and politician [[Gudmund Harlem]].\n\nIn 1963, Brundtland graduated with a medical degree, a [[cand.med.]] from the [[University of Oslo]]. She took her master's degree at [[Harvard University]] in 1965, as a [[Master of Public Health]].\n\nFrom 1966 to 1969, she worked as a physician at the [[Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs|Directorate of Health]] (''Helsedirektoratet''), and from 1969 she worked as a doctor in Oslo's public school health service.\n\n==Political career==\nShe was [[Minister of the Environment (Norway)|Norwegian Minister for Environmental Affairs]] from 1974 to 1979.\n\n===Prime Minister of Norway===\nBrundtland became Norway's first female [[List of Norwegian Prime Ministers|Prime Minister]] in 1981. She served as Prime Minister from February to October.\n\n[[File:Gro Harlem Brundtland - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 1989.jpg|left|thumb|Brundtland at the [[World Economic Forum]] annual meeting in 1989]]\nBrundtland became Norwegian Prime Minister for two further, and more durable, terms. The second ministry was from 9 May 1986 until 16 October 1989 and this cabinet became known worldwide for its high proportion of female ministers: nearly half, or eight of the total eighteen ministers, were female. The third ministry was from 3 November 1990 to 25 October 1996.\n\nBrundtland became leader of the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] in 1981 and held the office until resigning in 1992, during her third term as Prime Minister. In 1996, she resigned as Prime Minister and retired completely from Norwegian politics. Her successor as both Labour Party leader in 1992 and as Prime Minister in 1996 was [[Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland]].\n\n==International career==\nIn 1983, Brundtland was invited by then [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] to establish and chair the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED), widely referred to as the [[Brundtland Commission]]. She developed the broad political concept of [[sustainable development]] in the course of extensive public hearings, that were distinguished by their inclusiveness. The commission, which published its report, ''[[Our Common Future]]'', in April 1987, provided the momentum for the 1992 [[Earth Summit]]/[[UNCED]], which was headed by [[Maurice Strong]], who had been a prominent member of the commission. The Brundtland Commission also provided momentum for [[Agenda 21]].\n\nDuring her third ministry, the Norwegian government in 1993 took the initiative to sponsor secret peace talks between the Government of Israel led by [[Yitzchak Rabin]] - like Brundtland, leader of a Labour Party - and the PLO led by [[Yasser Arafat]]. This culminated with the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]]. For several years afterwards Norway continued to have a high-profile involvement in promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace, though increasingly displaced by the United States from its role as the mediator.\n\nAfter the end of her term as PM, Brundtland was then elected Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]] in May 1998. In this capacity, Brundtland adopted a far-reaching approach to public health, establishing a [[Commission on Macroeconomics and Health]], chaired by [[Jeffrey Sachs]], and addressing [[violence]] as a major public health issue. Brundtland spearheaded the movement, now worldwide, to achieve the abolition of [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]] by education, persuasion, and increased taxation.<ref>{{cite news | author=Claire Doole |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/background_briefings/smoking/198338.stm |title=WHO declares war on tobacco firms |publisher=[[BBC]] news |date=21 October 1998 |accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> Under her leadership, the World Health Organization was one of the first major employers to make quitting smoking a condition of employment.\n\nBrundtland was recognized in 2003 by ''[[Scientific American]]'' as their 'Policy Leader of the Year' for coordinating a rapid worldwide response to stem outbreaks of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]]. Brundtland was succeeded on 21 July 2003 by [[Jong-Wook Lee]]. In 1994, Brundtland was awarded the [[Karlspreis|Charlemagne Prize]] of the city of [[Aachen]].\n\nIn 2006 Brundtland was a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons who reviewed the work of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD). In May 2007, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] named Brundtland, as well as [[Ricardo Lagos]] (the former [[president of Chile]]), and [[Han Seung-soo]] (the former foreign minister of [[South Korea]]), to serve as UN Special Envoys for Climate Change.<ref>{{cite news |author=Edith M.

She became the school's first female student president, and graduated in 1964.\n\n==University, early career==\nShe earned an honors bachelor's degree in political science from the [[University of British Columbia]], graduating in 1969. She was active in the student government and served as the school's first female president of the freshman class. She then completed a year of graduate study at that school, to qualify for doctoral-level studies.<ref>''Time And Chance,'' by Kim Campbell, 1996, pp. 17\u201323.</ref> Campbell entered the [[London School of Economics]] in 1970 to study towards her doctorate in Soviet Government, and spent three months touring the [[Soviet Union]], from April to June 1972.

She earned, in 1983, an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] from the [[University of British Columbia]]. She was [[Call to the bar|called]] to the British Columbia [[bar (law)|Bar]] in 1984, and practised law in [[Vancouver]] until 1986.\n\n==Family, early political career==\nDuring her marriage to Divinsky, Campbell lectured part-time in political science at the University of British Columbia and at [[Vancouver Community College]]. While still attending law school, she entered politics as a trustee on the [[Vancouver School Board]], becoming, in 1983, the chair of that board and serving in 1984 as its vice-chair. She once claimed to have told the board to \"back off\" although others alleged that she said \"fuck off\".<ref>Donaldson, p. 354.</ref> In total, she was a trustee there from 1980 to 1984.

Campbell ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the BC Social Credit Party in the summer of 1986 (placing last with 14 votes from delegates), but was elected in October 1986 to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly as a Socred member for [[Vancouver-Point Grey]], getting 19,716 votes (23.2%, also in a double member riding).\n\n==Federal politics==\nCampbell was elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 federal election]] as the member of parliament (MP) from [[Vancouver Centre]].  She won the party nomination after the incumbent, [[Pat Carney]], declined to stand for re-nomination. In 1989 she was appointed to the cabinet as Minister of State (Indian Affairs and Northern Development).  From 1990\u20131993 she held the post of Minister of Justice and Attorney General where she oversaw notable amendments to the Criminal Code in the areas of firearms control and sexual assault.  In 1990, following the Supreme Court's decision invalidating the country's abortion law, Campbell was responsible for introducing Bill C-43 to govern [[Abortion in Canada|abortions in Canada]].

Campbell entered the party leadership race to succeed Mulroney. Campbell had served in four cabinet portfolios prior to running for the party leadership, including three years as Minister of Justice, and garnered support of more than half the PC caucus when she declared for the leadership.\n\nShe defeated [[Jean Charest]] at the [[Progressive Conservative leadership election, 1993|Progressive Conservative leadership convention]] that June, and [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Ray Hnatyshyn]] appointed her Prime Minister on June 25. As a concession to Charest, Campbell appointed him to the posts of [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Minister of Industry, Science and Technology (Canada)|Minister of Industry, Science and Technology]]\u2014the first largely symbolic, and the second a significant cabinet portfolio position.\n\nAfter becoming party leader and Prime Minister, Campbell set about reorganizing the cabinet. She cut it from 35 ministers to 23 ministers; she consolidated ministries by creating three new ministries: Health, Canadian Heritage, and Public Security. Campbell extensively campaigned during the summer, touring the nation and attending barbecues and other events. In August 1993, a [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] Canada poll showed Campbell as having a 51 percent approval rating, which placed her as Canada's most popular prime minister in 30 years.<ref>New York Times Article: \"[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/world/campbell-though-liked-may-not-win-in-canada.html]\"</ref><ref>Orlando Sentinel Article: \"[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-08-17/news/9308170734_1_first-female-prime-gallup-campbell Female Leader of Canada Is the Most Popular in 30 Years]\"</ref> By the end of the summer, her personal popularity had increased greatly, far surpassing that of [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] leader [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]].<ref>Woolstencroft 15.</ref> Support for the Progressive Conservative Party had also increased to within a few points of the Liberals, while the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] had been reduced to single digits.\n\nCampbell was the only Canadian prime minister not to have resided at [[24 Sussex Drive]] since that address became the official home of the Prime Minister of Canada in 1951. Campbell's predecessor Mulroney remained at 24 Sussex while renovations on his new home in [[Montreal]] were being completed. Campbell instead took up residence at [[Harrington Lake]], the PM's summer and weekend retreat, located in rural Quebec, north of Ottawa, and she did not move into 24 Sussex after Mulroney left. Like [[Charles Tupper]] and [[John Turner]], Campbell never sat in Parliament as Prime Minister, as her term was filled by the summer break and the election campaign.\n\n==The 1993 election==\n{{Main|Canadian federal election, 1993}}\n\nWhen an [[Canadian federal election, 1993|election]] was called in the fall of 1993, the party was optimistic that it would be able to remain in power and, if not, would at least be a strong [[opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] to a Liberal [[minority government]]. The election had to be called at that time pursuant to Section 4 of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].\n\n===Campaign===\nCampbell's initial popularity declined after the [[Dropping the writ|writ was dropped]]. When she was running for the party leadership, Campbell's frank honesty was seen as an important asset and a sharp contrast from Mulroney's highly polished style. However, this backfired when she told reporters at a [[Rideau Hall]] event that it was unlikely that the deficit or unemployment would be much reduced before the \"end of the century\". During the election campaign, she further stated that discussing a complete overhaul of Canada's social policies in all their complexities could not be done in just 47 days; this statement was reduced to her having stated that an election is no time to discuss important issues.\n\nProgressive Conservative support tailed off as the campaign progressed. By October, polls showed the Liberals were on their way to forming government, and would probably win a majority without dramatic measures. Hoping to take advantage of Campbell's greater popularity than Liberal leader Jean Chr\u00e9tien, the Progressive Conservative campaign team put together a [[1993 Chr\u00e9tien attack ad|series of ads attacking the Liberal leader]]. The second ad appeared to mock Chr\u00e9tien's [[Bell's Palsy]] facial paralysis, and generated a severe backlash from the media, with some Tory candidates calling for the ad to be pulled from broadcasts. Campbell claims to have not been directly responsible for the ad, and to have ordered it off the air<ref>Donaldson, p. 367.</ref> over her staff's objections.\n\nPC support plummeted, all but assuring that the Liberals would win a majority government.\n\n===Election defeat===\nOn election night, October 25, the Progressive Conservatives were swept from power in a Liberal [[landslide victory|landslide]]. Campbell herself was defeated in Vancouver Centre by rookie Liberal [[Hedy Fry]]. She conceded defeat with the remark, \"Gee, I'm glad I didn't sell my car.\"<ref>McLaughlin, David, ''Poisoned Chalice: The Last Campaign of the Progressive Conservative Party?'' (Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1994), p. 276</ref>\n\nIt was only the third time in Canadian history that a prime minister was unseated at the same time that his or her party lost an election. All Progressive Conservatives running for re-election lost their seats, with the lone exception of Sherbrooke MP [[Jean Charest]]. The Tories' previous support in Western Canada moved to Reform and the Liberals, while the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] inherited most soft-nationalist Tory support in [[Quebec]]. In some cases, the Bloc pushed Cabinet ministers from Quebec into third place.\n\nThe Tories still finished with over two million votes, taking third place in the popular vote, and falling only two percentage points short of Reform for second place. However, as a consequence of the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post system]], Tory support was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into victories in individual ridings. As a result, the Tories won only two seats, compared to Reform's 52 and the Bloc's 54. It was the worst defeat in party history, and the worst defeat ever suffered by a Canadian governing party at the federal level.\n\nCampbell faced hurdles that she blamed as being insurmountable. Mulroney left office as one of the most (and according to Campbell, ''the'' most)<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/weekinreview/25word.html?ex=1285300800&en=32d7b3545e99910a&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | work=The New York Times | title=Canada Still Has Mulroney to Kick Around | first=Clifford | last=Krauss | date=September 25, 2005 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in the 1940s. He considerably hampered his own party's campaign effort by staging a very lavish international farewell tour at taxpayer expense, and by staying in office until only two and a half months were left in his mandate.\n\nSome have pointed to her gender as a major contributing factor to her historic loss. [[University of New Brunswick]] professor Joanna Everitt writes that while media simply reported the facts about rival male leaders such as Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Campbell's actions were usually interpreted as having some motive (drawing up support, appealing to a group, etc.)<ref>{{cite news|author=Joanna Everitt |title=Uncovering the Coverage: Gender Biases in Canadian Political Reporting |publisher=Media Awareness Network |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/handouts/gender_portrayal/uncovering_coverage.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100217055204/http://www.media-awareness.ca:80/english/resources/educational/handouts/gender_portrayal/uncovering_coverage.cfm |archivedate=February 17, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nCanadian humourist [[Will Ferguson]] suggested that the poor campaign meant Campbell should receive \"some of the blame\" for her party's losses, though \"taking over the party leadership from Brian (Mulroney) was a lot like taking over the controls of a 747 just before it plunges into the Rockies.\"<ref>Will Ferguson, ''Bastards and Boneheads: Canada's Glorious Leaders Past and Present'' (Vancouver/Toronto: Douglas & McIntyre, 1999), p. 284.</ref>\n\nOn December 13, 1993, Campbell resigned as party leader; Jean Charest succeeded her.\n\n==Post-political career==\nDespite her dramatic loss in the election, the Canadian women's magazine ''[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]]'' named Campbell as its Woman of the Year for 1993.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/030001-1314-e.html A.

She was succeeded by former Irish President [[Mary Robinson]]. From 2003 until 2005 she served as President of the [[International Women's Forum]], a global organization of women of prominent achievement, with headquarters in Washington, D.C.  From 2001 to 2004, she lectured at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard University. She continues as an Honorary Fellow at the [[Center for Public Leadership]] at the Kennedy School. She served as a director of several publicly traded companies in high technology and biotechnology.\n\nCampbell chairs the steering committee of the [[World Movement for Democracy]]. She served on the board of the [[International Crisis Group]], an NGO that aims to prevent and resolve deadly conflicts. She is on the board of the [[Forum of Federations]], the [[EastWest Institute]], and is on the advisory body of the [[The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence]] at [[King's College London]]. She was a founding member of the [[Club de Madrid]], an independent organization whose main purpose is to strengthen democracy in the world. Its membership is by invitation only, and consists of former Heads of State and Government. At different times Campbell has served as its Interim President, Vice President and from 2004  2006 its [[Secretary General]]. Campbell was the founding Chair of the International Advisory Board of the Ukrainian [[Foundation for Effective Governance]], an NGO formed in September 2007 with the aid of businessman [[Rinat Akhmetov]].<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shimon-peres-takes-part-in-foundation-for-effective-governance-launch-in-kiev-56794017.html \"Shimon Peres talks, via video conference, of strong relationship between Israel and Ukraine\"].

Campbell also clarified to reporters that she is a supporter of the new Conservative Party. Fogarassy lost the election, placing a distant third.\n\nWhile testifying in April 2009 at the [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]]-[[Karlheinz Schreiber|Schreiber]] [[Airbus affair|Airbus inquiry]], Campbell said she still follows Canadian politics \"intermittently.\"<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/626328 \"Beatty baffled by millions in Bear Head lobby fees\"].

However, she did implement radical changes to the structure of the Canadian government. Under her tenure, the federal cabinet's size was cut from over 35 cabinet ministers and ministers of state to 23. This included the redesign of 8 ministries and the abolition or merging of 15 others.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/26/world/kim-campbell-takes-oath-as-canada-s-prime-minister.html</ref><ref>http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/mgm/dtail.asp?lang=eng&mstyid=25&mbtpid=1</ref> The Chr\u00e9tien government retained these new ministries when it took office.  The number of cabinet committees was reduced from 11 to 5. Her successors have continued to keep the size of the federal Cabinet to approximately 30 members. She was also the first prime minister to convene a First Ministers' conference for consultation prior to representing Canada at the [[G7]] Summit. Due to her brief time in office, Campbell holds a unique spot among Canadian prime ministers in that she made no [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] appointments.\n\nCampbell harshly criticized Mulroney for not allowing her to succeed him before June 1993. In her view, when she became prime minister, she had very little time or chance to make up ground on the Liberals once her initial popularity faded. In her memoirs, ''Time and Chance'', and in her response to ''[[The Secret Mulroney Tapes]],'' Campbell suggested that Mulroney knew the Tories would be defeated in the upcoming election, and wanted a \"scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity\" rather than a viable successor. The cause of the 1993 debacle remains disputed, with some arguing that the election results were a vote against Mulroney rather than a rejection of Campbell, and others suggesting that the poorly run Campbell campaign was the key factor in the result.\n\nAlthough the Progressive Conservatives survived as a distinct political party for another decade after the 1993 debacle, they never recovered their previous standing. During that period they were led by [[Jean Charest]] (1993\u20131998), [[Elsie Wayne]] (1998) and then, for the second time, by [[Joe Clark]] (1998\u20132003) (who had been [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Opposition Leader]] and briefly Prime Minister 20 years earlier). By 2003, the party under new leader [[Peter MacKay]] had voted to merge with the [[Canadian Alliance]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], thus ceasing to exist, despite MacKay having promised not to pursue a mergers. Joe Clark continued to sit as a \"Progressive Conservative\" into 2004. The new generation of right-leaning Conservatives gained power in the election of 2006, ensuring the \"Tory\" nickname's survival in the federal politics of Canada. A PC \"rump\" caucus continued to exist in the Senate of Canada (consisting of certain Clark, Mulroney and [[Paul Martin]] appointees), but as of 2012 only one senator, [[Elaine McCoy]] of Alberta, sits as a Progressive Conservative.\n\nCampbell remains one of the youngest women to have ever assumed the office of Prime Minister in any country, and thus also one of the youngest to have left the office.\n\nCampbell was ranked No. 20 out of the first 20 Prime Ministers of Canada (through [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]) by a survey of 26 Canadian historians used by [[Jack Granatstein|J.L. Granatstein]] and [[Norman Hillmer]] in their 1997 book ''Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders''.  A follow-up article co-authored by Hillmer in 2011 for ''Maclean's Magazine'' broadened the number of historians surveyed; in this new survey of over 100 Canadian historians, Campbell again finished dead last, this time coming at #22 out of Canada's first 22 Prime Ministers (through [[Stephen Harper]]).<ref>http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/06/10/canadas-best-prime-ministers/</ref>\n\nIn 2004, she was included in the list of 50 most important political leaders in history in the ''Almanac of World History'' compiled by the [[National Geographic Society]]. She was cited for her status as the only woman [[head of government]] of a [[North America#Usage|North American country (defined variously)]], but controversy ensued among academics in Canada over the merit of this honour, since her brief term in office was marked by very few, if any, major political accomplishments.\n\nOn November 30, 2004, Campbell's official portrait for the parliamentary Prime Minister's gallery was unveiled.

She was Dominica's first, and to date only, female prime minister, as well as the nation's longest-serving prime minister. She was the second female prime minister in the [[Caribbean]] after [[Lucinda da Costa]] of the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and the first woman elected in her own right as [[head of government]] in the [[Americas]]. She was the world's third longest-serving female Prime Minister, behind [[Indira Gandhi]] of [[India]] and [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] of [[Sri Lanka]], and the world's longest continuously serving female Prime Minister ever. Charles was also Dominica's first female lawyer.\n\n==Personal life==\nCharles was born in the fishing village of [[Pointe Michel]] in [[Saint Luke Parish, Dominica|Saint Luke]] parish, to a \"coloured bourgeoise\" family.<ref name=obit>{{cite news|first=Polly|last=Pattullo|title=Obituary: Dame Eugenia Charles|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/sep/08/guardianobituaries.pollypattullo|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 September 2005|accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nShe attended Convent School in Dominica, then, island's only girls' secondary school, and became interested in [[law]] while working at the colonial magistrate's court.<ref name=obit/> She worked for many years as assistant to [[Alastair Forbes]]. She attended the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Canada]], before moving to the [[United Kingdom]] to attend the [[London School of Economics]]. She was a member of the [[sorority]] [[Sigma Gamma Rho]]. She passed the bar and returned to Dominica, where she became the island's first female lawyer, establishing a practice specialising in property law.<ref name=obit/>\n\nCharles never married nor had children. In 1991 she was made a Dame Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]].<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Political career==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\n[[Image:REAGANEugeniaCharles.jpg|thumb|left|Charles meets with [[United States President|American President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[White House]]'s [[Oval Office]] about ongoing events in [[Grenada]]]]\nCharles began campaigning in politics during the 1960s against restrictions on press freedom. She helped to found the [[Dominica Freedom Party]] (DFP), and was its leader from the early 1970s until 1995.<ref name=obit/> She was elected to the [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]] in 1970 and became Opposition Leader in 1975.<ref name=obit/> She continued serving after Dominica gained full independence from [[United Kingdom|British]] rule in 1978.\n\nCharles became Prime Minister when the DFP swept the 1980 elections, the party's first electoral victory. She took over from [[Oliver Seraphin]], who had himself only taken over the year before after mass protests had forced the country's first prime minister, [[Patrick John]], to step down from office. She additionally served as Dominica's [[Foreign Minister]] from 1980 to 1990, and also served as chairperson of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).\n\nIn 1981 she faced two attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coups d'\u00e9tat]]. That year [[Frederick Newton]], commander of the [[Military of Dominica]], organised an attack on the police headquarters in Roseau, resulting in the death of a police officer.<ref name=coup>{{cite news|title=Ex-Commander Hanged For Dominica Coup Role|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/09/world/around-the-world-ex-commander-hanged-for-dominica-coup-role.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=9 August 1986|accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref> Newton and five other soldiers were found guilty in the attack and sentenced to death in 1983.

The attempt, which the conspirators codenamed [[Operation Red Dog]], was thwarted by American federal agents in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and was soon facetiously dubbed the \"Bayou of Pigs\" after the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nCharles became more widely known to the outside world for her role in the lead-up to the [[United States]] [[Invasion of Grenada]]. In the wake of the arrest and execution of Grenadian Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]], Charles, then serving as chair of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], appealed to the United States, [[Jamaica]], and [[Barbados]] for intervention.<ref name=obit/> She later appeared on television with U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]], supporting the invasion. Journalist [[Bob Woodward]] has detailed that millions of US dollars were paid to the [[Dominica]] Government by the US, some of which was regarded by the CIA as a 'payoff' for Mrs. Charles's support for the US intervention in [[Grenada]].<ref>Bob Woodward.

However, many of her policies appeared centrist or even leftist by American standards; for instance, she did support some social welfare programmes. Other issues that were important to her were anti-corruption measures and individual freedom. For her uncompromising stance on this and other issues, she became known as the \"Iron Lady of the Caribbean\" (after the original \"Iron Lady\", [[Margaret Thatcher]]).\n\n==Later years and death==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nHer popularity declined during her third term, and she announced her retirement in 1995. The DFP subsequently lost the 1995 elections. After retiring, she undertook speaking engagements in the United States and abroad, and became involved in former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[Carter Center]], which promotes human rights and observes elections. On 30 August 2005, Charles was taken to a hospital in [[Fort-de-France]], [[Martinique]], for [[hip replacement|hip-replacement]] surgery and died from a [[pulmonary embolism]] on 6 September at 86 years of age.\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/lotw/1.html ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nTimes-Eugenia-Charles/dp/1450709737 Gabriel J.

She is Turkey's first and only female prime minister to date. As the leader of the [[True Path Party]], she went on to concurrently serve as [[Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey]] and as  [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] between 1996 and 1997.\n\nAs a [[Professor]] of [[Economics]], \u00c7iller was appointed as [[Minister of State]] with responsibility for the [[Economy of Turkey|economy]] by Prime Minister [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]] in 1991. When Demirel was [[Turkish presidential election, 1993|elected]] as [[President of Turkey|President]] in 1993, \u00c7iller was elected leader of the True Path Party and succeeded Demirel as Prime Minister. Her premiership preceded over the intensifying armed conflict between the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] and the Kurdish separatist [[PKK]], resulting in \u00c7iller enacting numerous reforms to national defence and implementing the [[Castle Plan]]. With a better equipped military, \u00c7iller's government was able to persuade the [[United States]] to register the PKK as a terrorist organisation, while controversially enlisting the help of [[organised crime|informal organisations]] (known as the [[Deep state]]) to fight against Kurdish separatists and the [[Armenia]]n nationalist group [[ASALA]]. Shortly after winning the [[Turkish local elections, 1994|1994 local elections]], large-scale [[capital flight]] due to the lack of confidence in \u00c7iller's [[budget deficit]] targets led to the [[Turkish Lira]] and foreign currency reserves almost collapsing. Amid the subsequent [[Economic history of Turkey|economic crisis]] and [[austerity]] measures, her government signed the [[EU-Turkey Customs Union]] in 1995. Her government was alleged to have supported the [[1995 Azeri coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]] and presided over an escalation of tensions with [[Greece]] after claiming sovereignty over the [[Imia/Kardak]] islets. Although the DYP came third in the [[Turkish general election, 1995|1995 general election]], she remained as Prime Minister until [[Necmettin Erbakan]] formed a government in 1996 with \u00c7iller becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe [[Susurluk car crash]] in 1996 and the subsequent [[Susurluk scandal]] revealed the relations between extra-legal organisations and \u00c7iller's government. Revelations that \u00c7iller had employed individuals such as [[Abdullah \u00c7atl\u0131]] led to a decline of popularity. Erbakan's government fell following a [[1997 military memorandum|military memorandum]] in 1997 and the DYP declined further in the [[Turkish general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. Despite coming third in the [[Turkish general election, 2002|2002 general election]], \u00c7iller's DYP won less than 10% of the vote and thus lost all parliamentary representation, which led to her resignation as party leader and departure from active politics.\n\n== Background and early career ==\n\u00c7iller was born at [[Istanbul]]; her father was first a journalist, then a Turkish governor of [[Bilecik Province]] during the 1950s. Tansu was the only child and she graduated from the School of Economics at [[Robert College]] after finishing the [[Robert College|American College for Girls]] in [[Istanbul]]. She received her [[Master of Science|M.S.]] from the [[University of New Hampshire]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Connecticut]]. She later completed her [[postdoctoral]] studies at [[Yale University]].\n\n\u00c7iller taught economics at [[Franklin and Marshall College]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. In 1978, she became a lecturer at [[Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University]] in Istanbul and in 1983 she was appointed as professor by the same institution. She also worked in the now-defunct [[Istanbul Bank]] as president of the company.\n\n== Political career (1990\u20132002)==\n\u00c7iller entered politics in November 1990, joining the conservative [[True Path Party]] (DYP) as economic advisor to former Prime Minister [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]]. She was elected to the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly|parliament]] in 1991 as deputy representing Istanbul. The DYP became the largest party (with 27 per cent of the seats) and Demirel formed a coalition government ([[49th government of Turkey]]). Tansu \u00c7iller was appointed economics minister. She was elected to the executive board of DYP and acquired the position as deputy chair.<ref>Arat, Ye\u015fim (1998) \"A women prime minister in Turkey: did it matter?\" ''Women & Politics'', 19(4): 1-22; Jensen, Jane (2008) ''Women political leaders: breaking the highest glass ceiling'' New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 41-2, 131; Skard, Torild (2014) \"Tansu \u00c7iller\" in ''Women of power - Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, ISBN 978-1-44731-578-0, pp. 392-3</ref>\n\n=== Prime Minister (1993\u20131996) ===\nAfter the death in office of President [[Turgut \u00d6zal]] (which according to some was part of the [[1993 alleged Turkish military coup]]), DYP Prime Minister [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]] won the [[Turkish presidential election, 1993|1993 presidential election]] on 16 May 1993. Suddenly the important position as Prime Minister and leader of the DYP was vacant. The party found itself in an identity crisis. Ciller was no obvious candidate, but the three male contenders could not muster the resources, skill and support to compete effectively. Ciller was a professional urban woman, young and smart with a Western higher education. The media supported her, as well as the business community, and externally she gave the impression that Turkey was a progressive Muslim country. On 13 June 47-year-old \u00c7iller fell 11 votes shy of a majority in the first ballot for party leader. Her opponents withdrew and she became the party's leader and on 25 June, the [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister]] of the DYP-[[Social Democratic Populist Party (Turkey)|Social Democratic Populist Party]] (SHP) coalition government ([[50th government of Turkey]]).<ref>Arat, Yesim (1998) pp. 6-8; Bennett, Clinton (2010) \"Tansu Ciller\" in ''Moslem women of power'', London: Continuum, pp. 110, 129; Cizre, Umit (2002) \"Tansu Ciller: lusting for power and undermining democracy\" in M.

She was the only woman until 1995, when a woman state minister for women and family affairs was appointed. Ciller did not continue Demirel's policies. As Prime Minister she promoted a conservative populism and economic liberalism. She juggled \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" styles, boasting of her \"toughness\" at the same time as she wanted to be the nation's mother and sister. She became a new role model for a woman politician with clout who did not deny her femininity, and she had success, but also created confusion, distrust and disgust. She ruled authoritatively, taking control of the party organization, pursued established male politicies and was uninterested in women's issues.<ref>Arat (1998), pp. 3, 9-10,12-14; Cizre (2002), pp. 206-7; Skard (2014), pp. 394-5</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of \u00d6zal, the [[Castle Plan]] to attack the PKK (previously approved by the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]]) was put into effect (although elements of the strategy preceded the official Plan). \u00c7iller declared on 4 October 1993: \"We know the list of businessmen and artists subjected to racketeering by the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]]  and we shall be bringing their members to account.\" Beginning on 14 January 1994, almost a hundred people were kidnapped by commandos wearing uniforms and travelling in police vehicles and then killed somewhere along the road from Ankara to Istanbul. [[Abdullah Catli]], a leader of the ultra-nationalist [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]] and an organized crime figure, demanded money from people who were on \"\u00c7iller\u2019s list\", promising to get their names removed. One of his victims, [[Beh\u00e7et Cant\u00fcrk]], was to pay ten million dollars, to which Casino King [[\u00d6mer L\u00fctf\u00fc Topal]] added a further seventeen million. However, after receiving the money, he then went on to have them kidnapped and killed, and sometimes tortured beforehand.<ref name=\"Diplo\">{{cite news | title=Turkey's pivotal role in the international drug trade | authorlink=Kendal Nezan|first=Kendal|last=Nezan|work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] | date=5 July 1998 | url=http://mondediplo.com/1998/07/05turkey}}</ref>\n\nThe [[EU-Turkey Customs Union]] agreement was signed in 1995 and came into effect in 1996 during \u00c7iller's government. In March 1995 the [[1995 Azeri coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]] took place; official reports following the 1996 [[Susurluk scandal]] suggested \u00c7iller and others in the government had supported the coup attempt, which aimed to reinstall [[Ebulfeyz El\u00e7ibey]] as president.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) from the coalition in October 1995 (the SHP had split, merged, and renamed itself) \u00c7iller attempted to form a minority government, which failed in less than a month ([[51st government of Turkey]]). After that she agreed to form another cabinet ([[52nd government of Turkey]]) with the CHP and went for general elections, which took place [[Turkish general election, 1995|in December 1995]]. Coalition negotiations were protracted, and \u00c7iller remained in office at the head of the DYP-CHP coalition until March 1996, when the DYP formed a coalition with the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]], with [[Mesut Y\u0131lmaz]] becoming Prime Minister.\n\n\u00c7iller was still prime minister during the January 1996 [[Imia/Kardak]] crisis with neighbouring [[Greece]].\n\nOne of \u00c7iller's major achievements was to transform the [[Turkish Army]] from an organization using vintage equipment from the [[US Army]] into a modern fighting force capable of defeating the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]], using [[hit-and-run tactics]]. She also convinced the U.S. government to list the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, which was later followed by the acceptance of the same by the [[European Union]].\n\n=== Deputy Prime Minister (1996\u20131997) ===\nWith the creation of the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]]-DYP coalition in March 1996 under [[Mesut Y\u0131lmaz]] ([[53rd government of Turkey]]), \u00c7iller became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and deputy Prime Minister. After the coalition collapsed in June 1996, the DYP joined a new coalition with the [[Welfare Party]], under [[Necmettin Erbakan]], with \u00c7iller retaining her positions. This was the beginning of DYP's and \u00c7iller's decline. \u00c7iller lost credibility as a political leader because she joined forces with those she criticized the most.<ref>Arat (1998), p. 18; Cizre (2002), p. 213; Skard (2014), pp. 395-6</ref>\n\nAfter the November 1996 [[Susurluk car crash]], which prompted the [[Susurluk scandal]], she praised [[Abdullah \u00c7atl\u0131]], who died in the crash, saying: \"Those who fire bullets or suffer their wounds in the name of this country, this nation, and this state will always be respectfully remembered by us.\"<ref>[[Lucy Komisar]], [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_n4_v61/ai_19254727/pg_3 Turkey's terrorists: a CIA legacy lives on],{{dead link|date=October 2013}} ''[[The Progressive]]'', April 1997.</ref><ref name=HRFT39>[http://www.tihv.org.tr/EN/data/Yayinlar/Human_Rights_Reports/Ra1998HumanRigthsReport.pdf 1998 Report] from the [[Human Rights Foundation of Turkey]], chapter II, \"SUSURLUK SCANDAL: Counter-guerilla Affairs\", pp. 39\u201386 (see note on p. 39)</ref>\n\nAs deputy Prime Minister, \u00c7iller declared that if [[Greece]] tried to divide [[Albania]], it would have the Turkish Army in [[Athens]] 24 hours later.<ref name=\"hri\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ant1en/1997/97-06-04.ant1en.html|title=PANGALOS/GR-TURK.RELATIONS|publisher=hri.org}}</ref><ref name=\"hri2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/ata/1997/97-03-21.ata.html#11|title=\"TURKEY WILL NOT STAY SPECTATOR TOWARDS EFFORTS TO DIVIDE ALBANIA\" - declares Tansu \u00c7iller|publisher=hri.org}}</ref>\n\nErbakan's [[Welfare Party]] resigned from government following the February [[1997 military memorandum (Turkey)|1997 military memorandum]].

She was the first and to date only woman to hold the position.\n\n== Family Background ==\n\nElisabeth Domitien was born in Bangui. The family had a plantation, and her father was employed in the postal service while her mother was a farmer.\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\nElisabeth was the eldest child and the only daughter. She got only a rudimentary instruction in reading and writing in a Catholic school and learned cooking and sewing. She worked in the field and helped to sell products. She learned to deal with numbers and established herself as a farmer and business woman. She had a strong personality and was enterprising. The women gathered around her and she became an informal leader in the community. At the age of 20 she became involved in the liberation struggle.<ref>Torild Skard (2014) \"Elisabeth Domitien\" in Women of power - half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide, Bristol: Policy Press. ISBN 978-1-44731-5780</ref>\n\n== Political life ==\n\nElisabeth Domitien mobilized the population with her speeches in Sangho, helped unite different groups and created a sense of national identity. She became head of the women's group in the independence movement, the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa ([[MESAN]]). She collaborated closely with Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Boganda, the founder of the movement, and became president of the party in 1953. The country became independent in 1960 and Domitien collaborated with the first president of the Central African Republic, David Dacko, and the commander-in-chief, Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa. She served as a political adviser both to the leaders and to ordinary people, trying to reconcile different interests and improve the living standards of the population. Dacko ruled in an authoritarian way and the country soon became a one-party state with MESAN as the sole legal party. In 1965 Bokassa seized power in a coup, abolished the constitution, dissolved parliament and appointed himself as the head of the party, state and government with legislative and executive power.<ref>Torild Skard (2014) \"Elisabeth Domitien</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Bokassa declared himself president for life and made Elisabeth Domitien vice president of the party. In 1973 she led the first national congress of Central African farmers. She was clever and industrious, appealed to the population and served as a unifying force which Bokassa needed. In 1974 he declared himself as marshal. He had a cabinet in which the ministers changed constantly and on 2 January 1975 he formed a new government. Here Bokassa introduced the post of prime minister and Elisabeth Domitien was appointed to the position. It was the International Women's Year and Bokassa wanted to draw positive notice to himself internationally by appointing a woman in a leading position.<ref>Titley, Brian (1997).

ISBN 0-7735-1602-6 and Torild Skard (2014) \"Elisabeth Domitien\".</ref> She was the first woman to serve as prime minister of an [[Africa]]n nation.\n\nElisabeth Domitien worked to strengthen the income and position of women. She was criticized by some people in CAR for the support she gave Bokassa. In her view the population should follow their leader. At the same time, she demanded that the president should respect the people and safeguard their interests. She was not afraid to voice her opinion, even to the president, and got many people out of jail after they were arrested without trial. Her relationship with Bokassa soured when he wanted to proclaim himself emperor. When Domitien opposed the plan, she was promptly fired and her cabinet was dismissed (7 April 1976).<ref>Torild Skard (2014) \"Elisabeth Domitien\"</ref>\n\nWith the overthrow of Bokassa in September 1979, Domitien was arrested and brought to trial on charges of covering up extortion committed by Bokassa during her tenure as prime minister. She served a brief prison term and was put on trial in 1980, after which she was prohibited from returning to politics. In 1981, the military gained control again and ruled for 12 years. In 1993, it was replaced by a civilian government and Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9 was elected president. Then Domitien received compensation for the unjust treatment she had been exposed to. She remained a prominent figure, both as a former politician and as a businesswoman, and was buried with official honours when she died in 2005.<ref>Torild Skard (2014) \"Elisabeth Domitien\" and [http://www.terra.es/personal2/monolith/00women3.htm Women Prime Ministers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nElisabeth Domitien married twice, but lived all the time in Bangui. Her first husband was Jean Baka who was an accountant in a river company and commuted back and forth between Bangui and Brazzaville.

Indira Gandhi was the only child of [[India]]'s first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|her assassination]] in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister after her father. \n  \nGandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964.  She was elected [[Congress President]] in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964,  Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]]. In Congress' party parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966 upon the death of [[Lal Bahadur Shastri|Shastri]], she defeated her rival, [[Morarji Desai]], to become leader and thus succeed Shastri as Prime Minister of India.\n\nAs Prime Minister of India, Gandhi was known for her political ruthlessness and unprecedented [[centralisation of power]]. She went to [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war]] with [[Pakistan]] in support of the [[6 Point Movement|independence movement]] and [[Bangladesh Liberation War|war of independence]] in [[East Pakistan]], which resulted in an Indian victory and the creation of [[Bangladesh]], as well as increasing India's influence to the point where it became the regional [[hegemon]] of [[South Asia]]. Gandhi also presided over a controversial [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] from 1975 to 1977 during which she [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]]. She was assassinated in 1984 by her [[Sikh]] bodyguards a few months after she ordered the [[Operation Blue Star|storming of the Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] to counter the [[Punjab insurgency]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nIndira Gandhi was born Indira Nehru in a [[Kashmiri Pandit]] family on 19 November 1917 in [[Allahabad]].{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=13}} Her father, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], was a leading figure in India's political [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] from [[British Raj|British rule]], and became the first Prime Minister of the [[Union of India|Union]] (and later [[Republic of India|Republic]]) of India.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=3}} She was the only child (a younger brother was born, but died young),{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=31}} and grew up with her mother, [[Kamala Nehru]], at the [[Anand Bhavan]]; a large family estate in Allahabad.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=16}} She had a lonely and unhappy childhood.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=25}} Her father was often away, directing political activities or being incarcerated in prison, while her mother was frequently bed-ridden with illness, and later suffered an early death from tuberculosis.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=32}} She had limited contact with her father, mostly through letters.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=55}}\n\nGandhi was mostly taught at home by tutors, and intermittently attended school until matriculation in 1934.

Some of these were due to  high inflation which was in turn caused by war time expenses, drought in some parts of the country and more importantly, the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The opposition to Gandhi in 1973-75 period, after the Indira wave had receded, was strongest in Bihar and Gujarat. In Bihar, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], the veteran leader came out of retirement to lead the protest movement there.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\n===Verdict on electoral malpractice===\nOn 12 June 1975 the [[High Courts of India|High Court of Allahabad]] declared Indira Gandhi's election to the [[Lok Sabha]] void on grounds of electoral malpractice. In an election petition filed by [[Raj Narain]] (who later on defeated her in 1977 parliamentary election from [[Raebareli|Rae Bareily]]), he had alleged several major as well as minor instances of using government resources for campaigning.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The court thus ordered her stripped of her parliamentary seat and banned from running for any office for six years. The Prime Minister must be a [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|member]] of either the [[Lok Sabha]] (the lower house in the [[Parliament of India]]) or a [[Member of parliament, Rajya Sabha|member]] of the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house). Thus, this decision effectively removed her from office. Gandhi had asked one of her colleagues in government, Mr [[Ashoke Kumar Sen]] to defend her in court.\n\nBut Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. The verdict was delivered by Mr Justice [[Jagmohanlal Sinha]] at Allahabad High Court. It came almost four years after the case was brought by Raj Narain, the premier's defeated opponent in the 1971 parliamentary election. Gandhi, who gave evidence in her defence during the trial, was found guilty of dishonest election practices, excessive election expenditure, and of using government machinery and officials for party purposes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/12/newsid_2511000/2511691.stm |work=BBC News  | title=1975: Gandhi found guilty of corruption | date=12 June 1975}}</ref> The judge, however, rejected more serious charges of bribery against her.\n[[File:Indira and Nixon.JPG|thumb|upright|With [[Richard Nixon]], 1971]]\nGandhi insisted that the conviction did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, by order of the High Court. She said: \"There is a lot of talk about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [opposition] parties were forming governments\". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. \"Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country,\" he said. \"I believe the prime minister of India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise\".\n\n===State of Emergency (1975\u20131977)===\n{{Main article|The Emergency (India)}}\nGandhi moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. Her Cabinet and government then recommended that President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] declare a [[state of emergency]] because of the disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad High Court decision. Accordingly, Ahmed declared a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder, based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on 25 June 1975.\n\n===Rule by decree===\n\nWithin a few months, [[President's Rule]] was imposed on the two opposition party ruled states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] thereby bringing the entire country under direct Central rule or by governments led by the ruling Congress party.<ref>Kochanek, Stanely, ''Mrs. Gandhi's Pyramid: The New Congress'', (Westview Press, Boulder, CO 1976) p. 98</ref>\nPolice were granted powers to impose curfews and indefinitely detain citizens and all publications were subjected to substantial censorship by the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]]. Finally, the impending legislative assembly elections were indefinitely postponed, with all opposition-controlled state governments being removed by virtue of the constitutional provision allowing for a dismissal of a state government on recommendation of the state's governor.\n\nIndira Gandhi used the emergency provisions to change conflicting party members.\n{{bq|1=\nUnlike her father Jawaharlal Nehru, who preferred to deal with strong chief ministers in control of their legislative parties and state party organizations, Mrs. Gandhi set out to remove every Congress chief minister who had an independent base and to replace each of them with ministers personally loyal to her...Even so, stability could not be maintained in the states...<ref>Brass, Paul R., ''The Politics of India Since Independence'', ([[Cambridge University Press]], England 1995) p. 40</ref>}}\n\nPresident Ahmed issued [[decree|ordinances]] that did not require debate in the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]], allowing Gandhi to [[rule by decree]].\n\n===Rise of Sanjay===\nThe Emergency saw the entry  of Gandhi's younger son, [[Sanjay Gandhi|Sanjay]], into Indian Politics.

Gandhi may have grossly misjudged her popularity {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about her. In any case, she was opposed by the Janata alliance of Opposition parties. Janata alliance, with Jai Prakash Narayan as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" \nThe Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD (Congress for Democracy), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that.\nGandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. \nThe Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]]. The other leaders of the Janata Party were [[Charan Singh]], [[Raj Narain]], [[George Fernandes]]  and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].\n\n===In opposition and return to power===\n[[File:1984 CPA 5588.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1984 [[USSR]] commemorative stamp]]\n\nSince Gandhi had lost her seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed [[Yashwantrao Chavan]] as their parliamentary  party leader. Soon afterwards, the Congress party split again with Gandhi floating her own Congress (I) faction. She won a bye-election from the [[Chikamagalur]] constituency to the [[Lok sabha]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Maramkal|first1=M-B|title=Chikmagalur remembers Indira Gandhi|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/Chikmagalur-remembers-Indira-Gandhi/articleshow/26064352.cms|issue=November 20|publisher=Times of India|date=2013}}</ref> However, the Janata government's Home Minister, Choudhary [[Charan Singh]], ordered the arrest of her and Sanjay Gandhi on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court. The arrest meant that Indira Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament.

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the  government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]].  The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress (I). After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979. Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, by President Reddy, after Indira and Sanjay Gandhi promised Singh that Congress (I) would support his government from outside on certain conditions.,<ref name=\"Supporting Charan Singh\">{{cite book|last1=de Mesquita|first1=Bruce Bueno|title=The Predictioneer's Game: Using the Logic of Brazen Self-Interest to See and shapte the future|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-7977-0|page=xxiii|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8BafGvdAYYEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA10&dq=indira+gandhi+%22charan+singh%22&ots=ipC0QGvfrR&sig=WSGY3FV2d4Ip5OHljLiajnyxsDA#v=onepage&q=%22charan%20singh%22&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Charan Singh\">{{cite book|last1=Sanghvi|first1=Vijay|title=The Congress, Indira to Sonia Gandhi  By|date=2006|publisher=Kalpaz|location=Delhi|isbn=81-7835-340-7|pages=114\u2013122|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=npdqD_TXucQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA7&dq=indira+to+soniya+congress&ots=5RE4QuraUJ&sig=BhhnMjsCiFzwZvEIrP5QX2EVork#v=onepage&q=charan&f=false}}</ref> The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the ''Fourth Five-Year Plan'' in 1969.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasized greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalization process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s and transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains and prone to famine to being largely able to feed itself, and become successful in achieving its goal of food security.

Gandhi authorised the development of nuclear weapons in 1967, in response to the ''[[Test No. 6]]'' by People's Republic of China. Gandhi saw this test as Chinese nuclear intimidation, therefore, Gandhi promoted the views of Nehru to establish India's stability and security interests as independent from those of the nuclear superpowers.\n\nThe program became fully mature in 1974, when Dr. [[Raja Ramanna]] reported to Gandhi that India had the ability to test its first nuclear weapon. Gandhi gave verbal authorisation of this [[nuclear testing|test]], and preparations were made in a long-constructed army base, the [[Indian Army]] [[Pokhran Test Range]]. In 1974, India successfully conducted an underground nuclear test, unofficially code named as \"''[[Smiling Buddha]]''\", near the desert village of [[Pokhran]] in Rajasthan. As the world was quiet by this test, a vehement protest came forward from Pakistan. Great ire was raised in Pakistan and its Prime Minister, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], described this test as \"''Indian hegemony''\" to intimidate Pakistan. In response to this [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] launched a massive campaign all over the Pakistan to make Pakistan a nuclear power. In these campaigns [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] asked the nation to get united and great slogans were raised such as ''hum ghaas kha lay gay magar nuclear power ban k rhe gay (we would eat grass but would surely achieve nuclear power)''. Gandhi directed a letter to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] and, later to the world, describing the test for [[Peaceful nuclear explosions|peaceful purposes]] and India's commitment to develop its programme for industrial and scientific use.\n\n==Family and personal life==\n[[Image:Feroze and Indira Gandhi.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Personal Life|Portrait of [[Feroze Gandhi|Feroze]] and Indira Gandhi]]\nA member of the [[Nehru-Gandhi family]], she was married to [[Feroze Gandhi]] at the age of 25, in 1942.

Her younger son Sanjay had initially been her chosen heir; but after his death in a flying accident in June 1980, Gandhi  persuaded her reluctant elder son Rajiv to quit his job as a pilot and enter politics in February 1981. Rajiv took office as [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] following his mother's [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassination]] in 1984; he served until December 1989.

She previously served as the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia#List of Deputy Prime Ministers of Australia|13th]] [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia]], and held the cabinet positions of [[Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth|Minister for Education]], [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations]] and [[Minister for Social Inclusion (Australia)|Minister for Social Inclusion]] from 2007 to 2010. She was the first and to date only woman to hold the positions of deputy prime minister, prime minister and leader of a major party in Australia.\n\nBorn in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], [[Wales]], Gillard migrated with her family to [[Adelaide]], South Australia, in 1966. She attended [[Mitcham Primary School|Mitcham Demonstration School]] and [[Unley High School]]. Subsequently, Gillard studied at the [[University of Adelaide]], but cut short her courses to move to [[Melbourne]], Victoria, in 1982, where she worked with the [[Australian Union of Students]] and served as the organisation's president from 1983 to 1984. Gillard later graduated from the [[University of Melbourne]], with a Bachelor of Laws degree (1986) and a Bachelor of Arts degree (1989). In 1987, she joined the law firm [[Slater & Gordon]] and became a [[Partner (business rank)|partner]] in 1990, specialising in industrial law. A departure from the law firm in 1996 saw Gillard serve as chief of staff to the [[Leader of the Opposition (Victoria)|Leader of the Opposition]] in Victoria [[John Brumby]], which preceded her own entry into federal politics.\n\nGillard was first elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]] for the seat of [[Division of Lalor|Lalor]]. Following the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 federal election]], she was elected to the [[Shadow Cabinet of Australia|Shadow Cabinet]] and was given the portfolio of Population and Immigration. In 2003, she took on the responsibility for both Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs and Health. In December 2006, when [[Kevin Rudd]] was elected as Labor Leader and became [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]], Gillard was elected unopposed as his deputy. Upon Labor's victory in the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], Gillard became the first female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, and held the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] portfolios of Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. On {{Nowrap|24 June 2010}}, after Rudd lost the support of his party and resigned, Gillard was elected unopposed as the Leader of the Labor Party, thus becoming the 27th Prime Minister of Australia. The subsequent [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]] saw the first [[hung parliament]] since the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]]. Gillard was able to form a minority government with the support of a [[Australian Greens|Green]] MP and three [[independent (politician)|independent]] MPs. On 26 June 2013, after a [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, June 2013|leadership spill]], Gillard lost the leadership of the Labor Party to Rudd. Her resignation as Prime Minister took effect the following day. Gillard retired from politics on 5 August 2013, before the impending federal election.\n\nFollowing her departure from politics, in August 2013 Gillard became an honorary [[Visiting scholar|visiting professor]] at the University of Adelaide, and a nonresident [[Fellow|senior fellow]] at the [[Brookings Institution|Brookings Institution's]] Center for Universal Education in October. Gillard released her political memoirs, ''[[My Story (Julia Gillard autobiography)|My Story]]'', in September 2014. She has been on the board of the mental health organisation [[beyondblue]] since December 2014, and was made an honorary fellow of [[Aberystwyth University]] in June 2015. In addition to her various appointments, Gillard has served as the chairwoman of the [[Global Partnership for Education]] since February 2014.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life and family ==\nGillard was born on 29 September 1961, in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], Wales.<ref name=\"Biog\">{{cite web |title=The Hon Julia Gillard MP, Member for Lalor (Vic)|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=83L |publisher=[[Australian House of Representatives]] |accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Julia Gillard comes from a village called Cwmgwrach, which means 'The Valley of the Witch'\">{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/politics/witch-prime-minister-comes-from-this-valley/story-e6frgczf-1225884482109?nk=f1fbe4a3b9e0e7c1bd8d8a9d73aadbf0|title=Julia Gillard comes from a village called Cwmgwrach, which means 'The Valley of the Witch' |date=26 June 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2014|work=[[The Australian]] }}</ref> After she suffered from [[bronchopneumonia]] as a child, her parents were advised it would aid her recovery if they were to live in a warmer climate.<ref name=\"AusStory\">{{cite web |title=Australian Story\u2014Julia Gillard Interview Transcript |url=http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2006/s1585300.htm |work=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] |date=6 March 2006 |accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref> This led the family to migrate to Australia in 1966, settling in Adelaide.<ref name=\"counterpoint\">{{cite episode|title=Julia Gillard in Person|series=Counterpoint|serieslink=Counterpoint (Radio National)|network=[[Radio National]]|airdate=20 September 2004|transcript=Transcript|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/counterpoint/stories/2004/1203667.htm}}</ref> In 1974, eight years after they arrived, Gillard and her family became Australian citizens.

General [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]] and most of the army remained loyal to the government. The following year, Ershad captured power through a bloodless coup and declared [[martial law]], suppressing political party activity and suspending the constitution. The constitution was later restored in 1986 after the general election won by General Ershad's [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] won, and martial law was withdrawn.\n\nHasina was in and out of detention throughout the 1980s. In 1984, Hasina was put under [[house arrest]] in February and again in November. In March 1985, she was put under house arrest for three months. Her party, along with the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]], led by Ziaur Rahman's widow Khaleda Zia, continued to work to restore democratically elected government, which they achieved by the democratic election in 1991, won by the BNP.\n\n===Leader of the opposition, 1986-87===\nHasina and the Awami League participated in the 1986 parliamentary elections held under President Ershad. She served as the leader of the [[Parliamentary opposition|opposition]] in 1986\u20131987.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hasina's decision to take part in the election had been criticised by her opponents, since the election was held under the martial law, and the other main opposition group, led by Khaleda Zia, boycotted the poll. However, her supporters maintained that she used the platform effectively to challenge Ershad's rule. Ershad dissolved the parliament in December 1987 when Hasina and her Awami League resigned from the parliament in an attempt to call for a fresh general election to be held under a neutral government. During November and December in 1987, mass uprising happened in Dhaka, several people were killed including [[Noor Hossain]], a Hasina supporter.\n\n===1991 election===\nAfter several years of autocratic rule, widespread protests and strikes created so much unrest that the economy was not functioning. A huge mass protest in December 1990 ousted General Ershad from the power, who resigned in favour of his Vice President Justice Shahabuddin. The [[caretaker government]], headed by [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]], the Chief Justice of the [[Bangladesh Supreme Court]], administered a general election for the parliament. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by Khaleda Zia won a general majority, and Hasina's Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1575704.stm|title=Analysis: A tale of two women|date=2001-10-02|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-03-28}}</ref> Among 3 constituencies Hasina fought, she lost in two and won in one. Accepting election defeat, Hasina offered resignation as the party president but stayed on at the request of party leaders.\n\n===The 1991\u20131996 period===\nPolitics in Bangladesh took a decisive turn in 1994, after [[Magura District|Magura]] [[by-election]]s. This election was held after the death of the MP for that constituency, a member of Hasina's party. The Awami League expected to win back the seat. But the BNP candidate won through rigging and manipulation, as per the neutral observer who came to witness the election.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===1996 elections===\nThe [[Awami League]], with other opposition parties, demanded that the next general elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, and that provision for caretaker governments to manage elections be incorporated in the constitution. The ruling BNP refused to act on these demands.\n\nOpposition parties launched an unprecedented campaign, calling strikes for weeks on end. The government accused them of destroying the economy while the opposition countered that BNP could solve this problem by acceding to their demands. In late 1995, the MPs of the Awami League and other parties resigned from the parliament. Parliament completed its term and a general election was held on 15 February 1996. The election was boycotted by all major parties except the ruling BNP. Hasina described the election as a farce.\n\nThe new parliament, composed mostly of BNP members, amended the constitution to create provisions for a caretaker government (CTG). The next parliamentary elections on 30 June 1996 were held under a neutral caretaker government headed by retired chief Justice [[Muhammad Habibur Rahman]].\n\n==First term as Prime Minister, 1996-2001==\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Hasina2.jpg|thumb|Hasina with US President [[Bill Clinton]] at the Prime Minister's Office in Dhaka, 2000.]]\nHasina served her first term as prime minister of Bangladesh from 1996-2001.

Hasina herself ran in three constituencies{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, and was defeated in a constituency in [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]], which included her husband's home town, but won in two other seats. Hasina and the Awami League rejected the results, claiming that the election was rigged with the help of the President and the caretaker government. The international community was largely satisfied with the elections, and the 'Four Party Alliance' went on to form the government.\n\n==Opposition period, 2001-2008==\nThe Awami League MPs were irregular in attending the Parliament during the following period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In late 2003, the Awami League started its first major anti-government movement, culminating in the declaration by party general secretary [[Abdul Jolil (Bangladesh politician)|Abdul Jolil]] that the government would fall before 30 April 2004.

She was elected as chairwoman of the [[Centre Party of Finland]] from 18 June 2000 to 5 October 2003, although the first year was as acting leader during [[Esko Aho]]'s sabbatical leave to lecture at [[Harvard University]].\n\n==Prime Minister==\n\nAfter eight years in opposition, she led the [[Centre Party of Finland]] to a narrow victory over the formerly largest party, the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]], in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary elections]] of 2003. According to the new constitution, which was in effect for the first time after this election, she was thereby given the first opportunity to form a new [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. After successful coalition negotiations with the Social Democrats and the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]], she came to head a coalition cabinet which chiefly continued on the lines of its predecessor, [[Paavo Lipponen's second Cabinet]], but introduced new measures to stimulate the economy, including tax cuts.\n\nDuring her brief time in office, Finland was the only country in the world to have women as both [[prime minister]] and [[president]], a situation underlined by the fact that half her cabinet were women.  (Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki's short term as Prime Minister of Finland is, however, not the shortest in the history of Finland. Beside caretaker cabinets and temporary prime ministers appointed due to the death or disease of the predecessor, [[Juho Heikki Vennola]] headed a Cabinet which lasted only for a little more than a month February\u2013March 1931, in connection with the [[Lapua Movement]]'s vociferous anti-democratic demands for influence on the presidential election.)\n\n== Resignation ==\n{{main|Iraq-gate (Finland)}}\nAnneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki resigned on 18 June 2003, under pressure resulting from the accusation that she had lied to Parliament and the public over how she had acquired confidential Foreign Ministry documents which she used for political purposes during the election campaign. The documents contained diplomatic information from a meeting between United States President [[George W. Bush]] and Finland's Prime Minister [[Paavo Lipponen]] about Finland's position regarding the U.S.'s [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]]. J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki used the information to suggest that her rival, the Social Democrat leader Paavo Lipponen, had secretly offered Finnish support for the U.S.-led coalition, a substantial breach of the official policy of neutrality in [[Foreign relations of Finland|Finland's foreign politics]], and thus associated Finland with what many Finns considered an [[Crimes against peace|illegal]] [[war of aggression]]. J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki broke the traditional unity and silence behind Finland's security policies. As the elections turned out to be close, the defeated Social Democrats found reasons to suspect that her nontraditional campaign tactic was decisive in determining the outcome, which soured the relationship between the two major coalition partners.\n\nAfter the leaked documents were published in several newspapers in March, the police launched a criminal investigation based on the [[Official Secrets Act (Finland)|Official Secrets Act]]. On 11 June prime Minister J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki was heard as a witness by the police, which led to increasing pressure on her to come clean on her role in the leak. The same week, the incriminating minutes of a meeting of Centre Party leaders were leaked to the press, as later came clear, via the Centre Party second vice-chairman [[Hannu Takkula]]. On 16 June it came to light that a presidential aide, [[Martti Manninen]], affiliated with the Centre Party, had leaked the foreign ministry documents. On 18 June J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki gave her \"full explanation\" to Parliament and apologised to the President, claiming that she had been faxed the documents without asking for them, and that she had not known of their secrecy. The Parliament was not satisfied with her account, and once Manninen (the same afternoon) publicly claimed that J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki had specifically and forcefully asked for the information, and that he would be able to prove it, her coalition partners made it clear that they had no trust in her leadership. She resigned the same evening, citing the lack of political trust, and without admitting any wrongdoing.\n\nConsequently, she announced on 24 June that she would resign as leader of the Centre Party. [[Matti Vanhanen]] was elected as the new party leader on 5 October, and he succeeded her as Prime Minister.\n\nThe police investigation into the leak concluded, on 19 December 2003, that J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki should be prosecuted for aiding or abetting Manninen in revealing state secrets in contravention of the law. However, on 19 March 2004, the Helsinki District Court acquitted J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki on all counts.\n\n== Member of European Parliament ==\nJ\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki currently serves as an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] for the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] in the [[European Parliament]]. In the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Finland)|2004 European Parliament elections]], she received over 140,000 votes, the highest individual tally and approximately 8% of all votes cast.\n\nIn April 2006, Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki announced to the Finnish media that she was going to take some time out of her parliamentary work due to [[breast cancer]], but she returned to politics following her successful recovery. Despite offers to return to Finnish national politics, she declined to become a candidate in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2007|Finnish Parliament elections in 2007]]. She was reelected to the European Parliament in the  [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Finland)|2009 European Parliament elections]] with the second highest tally of votes in Finland after [[Timo Soini]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://yle.fi/vaalit/tulospalvelu/elected_candidates.html | title = European Elections 2009 in Finland - Elected candidates | publisher = [[YLE]] | accessdate = 2010-07-17 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki's Cabinet]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.annelijaatteenmaki.net/ Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4ttenm\u00e4ki's personal website (in Finnish only)]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Hannele Pokka]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Minister of Justice (Finland)|Minister of Justice]]|years=1994\u20131995}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Riitta Uosukainen]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|Speaker of Parliament]]|years=2003}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Liisa Jaakonsaari]]<br><small>Acting</small>}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Paavo Lipponen]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Prime Minister of Finland]]|years=2003}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Matti Vanhanen]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{FinnishPrimeMinisters}}\n{{CentrePartyFinlandLeaders}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jaatteenmaki, Anneli}}\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Breast cancer survivors]]\n[[Category:Centre Party (Finland) politicians]]\n[[Category:Female heads of government]]\n[[Category:Ministers of Justice of Finland]]\n[[Category:People from Lapua]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Finland]]\n[[Category:Speakers of the Parliament of Finland]]\n[[Category:Centre Party (Finland) MEPs]]\n[[Category:MEPs for Finland 2004\u201309]]\n[[Category:MEPs for Finland 2009\u201314]]\n[[Category:Female MEPs for Finland]]\n[[Category:MEPs for Finland 2014\u201319]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Women prime ministers]]\n[[Category:Women government ministers of Finland]]"}]},"983605":{"pageid":983605,"ns":0,"title":"Janet Jagan","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox Officeholder\n|name             = Janet Jagan\n|honorific-suffix = [[Order of Excellence of Guyana|OE]]\n|image            = Janet Jagan.png\n|office           = 6th [[List of heads of state of Guyana|President of Guyana]]\n|primeminister    = [[Sam Hinds]]<br>[[Bharrat Jagdeo]]\n|term_start       = 19 December 1997\n|term_end         = 11 August 1999\n|predecessor      = [[Sam Hinds]]\n|successor        = [[Bharrat Jagdeo]]\n|office1          = [[List of Prime Ministers of Guyana|Prime Minister of Guyana]]\n|president1       = [[Sam Hinds]]\n|term_start1      = 17 March 1997\n|term_end1        = 19 December 1997\n|predecessor1     = [[Sam Hinds]]\n|successor1       = [[Sam Hinds]]\n|office2          = [[List of First Ladies of Guyana|First Lady of Guyana]]\n|president2       = [[Cheddi Jagan]]\n|term_start2      = 9 October 1992\n|term_end2        = 6 March 1997\n|predecessor2     = [[Joyce Hoyte]]\n|successor2       = [[Yvonne Hinds]]\n|birth_name       = Janet Rosenberg\n|birth_date       = {{birth date|1920|10|20|df=y}}\n|birth_place      = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|death_date       = {{death date and age|2009|3|28|1920|10|20|df=y}}\n|death_place      = [[Bel\u00e9m]], [[Brazil]]\n|spouse           = [[Cheddi Jagan]] {{small|(1943\u20131997)}}\n|party            = [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]]\n|alma_mater       = [[Northwestern University]]\n}}\n'''Janet Rosenberg Jagan''' (October 20, 1920 \u2013 March 28, 2009) was the first [[List of elected and appointed female heads of state|female]] [[List of Presidents of Guyana|President]] of [[Guyana]], serving from December 19, 1997, to August 11, 1999.

Her father was a merchant and her mother cultivated the soil and kept the house. Sylvie was the third of six children. The oldest was a girl and had to help her mother, but Sylvie was allowed to go to a Belgian school for girls run by nuns. She received both primary and secondary education and afterwards went to the capital, Bujumbura, to study economics. At 19 years old she married one of the professors and had four children, but continued her studies. She was also engaged in the women's organization of the governing Tutsi party and managed to get laws changed and economic and social measures implemented for women. She headed the group in the capital and was a member of the national executive board of the women's branch. After Kinigi graduated from [[Burundi University]], she got a job in Burundi's central bank and at the same time taught at the university. In the bank she was promoted and was given responsibility for research and studies. In 1991 she became adviser to the prime minister and was responsible for reducing military expenditures and carrying out an economic reform program.<ref>Skard (2014)</ref> \n\nThere was armed conflict between Hutus and Tutsis until 1993. Then elections were organized as a transition to democracy. To great surprise the leader of the opposition [[Melchior Ndadaye]] was elected [[President of Burundi]]. He appointed a cabinet with two thirds Hutu and one third Tutsi members. Sylvie Kinigi became Prime Minister. This was part of an effort to build unity between Burundi's two ethnic groups&nbsp;\u2014 Ndadaye was Hutu, and wished to decrease Tutsi hostility to his administration by appointing a Tutsi as Prime Minister. Kinigi stated that reconciliation would be her highest priority. <ref> Gunhild Hoogensen and Bruce O. Solheim (2006) 'Sylvie Kinigi' page 50-52, \"Women in power - world leaders since 1960\", Westport, CT: Praeger ISBN 0-275-98190-8 and Skard (2014)</ref> \n\nOn 21 October, however, President Ndadaye and six of his ministers were killed by Tutsi insurgents.

She was the object of criticism, attacks and threats from all sides and it was not long before she left the country.

Kosor was the first and so far only woman to become Prime Minister of Croatia since independence.<ref>Skard, Torild (2014) \"Croatia's Milka Planinc and Jadranka Kosor\" in ''Women of power - half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, ISBN 978-1-44731-578-0, pp. 326-33</ref> However, she is the second woman in Croatian post-[[World War II]] history to hold an office equivalent to a head of government, after [[Savka Dab\u010devi\u0107-Ku\u010dar]], who from 1967 until 1969 held the office of [[Prime Minister of Croatia|Chairman of the Executive Council]] (Prime Minister) and headed the 5th cabinet of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], a constituent republic of the [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].\n\nKosor started working as a [[journalist]], following her graduation from [[Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Law]] of [[University of Zagreb]]. During the [[Croatian War of Independence]], she hosted a radio show dealing with [[refugee]] problems and disabled [[war veteran]]s. She joined the [[centre-right]] [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) in 1989 and quickly climbed up the party hierarchy. In 1995 she was elected party vice-president and was elected to serve in [[Croatian Parliament|Parliament]] for the first time. After the death of [[President of Croatia|President]] and longtime HDZ leader [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]], Kosor supported Ivo Sanader's successful party leadership bid in 2000. Three years later, her party won the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary election]] and Kosor became the [[Ministry of Veterans' Affairs (Croatia)|Minister of Family, Veterans' Affairs and Inter-generational Solidarity]] in the [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader I|Sanader I]] and, later, [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II|Sanader II cabinet]], during which time she served as Deputy Prime Minister as well. In the [[Croatian presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] she ran as a representative of HDZ, but lost to incumbent President [[Stipe Mesi\u0107]] in the second round. After the abrupt resignation of Sanader, Kosor managed to form a functioning [[parliamentary majority]] and was approved to her new post as Prime Minister in July 2009, also becoming leader of her party. Kosor was the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 general election]], but HDZ lost in a landslide over the [[centre-left]] [[Kukuriku coalition]], led by the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|Social Democratic Party]]. Kosor handed power to the new Prime Minister, [[Zoran Milanovi\u0107]], in December 2011.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Kosor failed to commit to structural reforms and introduced new taxes as a response to the ongoing economic crisis. During her tenure, she strongly advocated a zero tolerance policy to political corruption and organized crime. This uncompromising stance, along with the new [[criminal code]] passed before her term began, opened the door to unprecedented efforts to combat corruption. This resulted in numerous arrests of influential business-people and politicians from across the political spectrum, although most of them members of HDZ, which severely damaged the party's reputation. The discoveries made by prosecutors were far-reaching and criminal charges were even raised against former Prime Minister and Kosor's own political mentor Ivo Sanader, who would later be charged with 10 years in prison for criminal activity and abuse of power. In [[foreign policy]], Kosor and her [[Slovenia]]n counterpart [[Borut Pahor]] were successful in solving the long-standing border dispute and she is credited with successfully finishing the negotiating process of the [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatian accession]] to the [[European Union]]. On 9 December 2011, she and President [[Ivo Josipovi\u0107]] signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2011|Treaty of Accession]] in [[Brussels]]. A [[Moderate|moderate conservative]], Kosor ran for another term as party leader after losing the election, however was defeated by the more [[conservative]] [[Tomislav Karamarko]]. After months of criticizing his leadership and the new party platform, she was expelled from HDZ by the party's High Court for damaging the party's reputation.\n\n==Early life==\n\nJadranka Kosor was born in [[Lipik]] and finished her primary education in [[Pakrac]].<ref name=\"slobodna-2009\">{{cite news | url = http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/60602/Default.aspx | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Slobodna Dalmacija]] | title = Djetinjstvo Jadranke Kosor: ljepotica i vunderkind | date = 2009-07-04 | accessdate = 2011-03-14}}</ref> She studied in [[Zagreb]], where she graduated in law and began working as a journalist from 1972 as a correspondent for ''[[Ve\u010dernji list]]'' and [[Radio Zagreb]].

She was also the vice-president of the Croatian Parliament. From 1999 to 2000, she was president of the HDZ's Women's Association Katarina Zrinski.

With the support of the [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II|coalition partners]] Kosor went to the President [[Stjepan Mesi\u0107]] who invited her to form a government. This resulted in the formation of the [[Cabinet of Jadranka Kosor|Kosor cabinet]] which contained most members of the previous Sanader administration. On July 6, [[Croatian Parliament|Parliament]] approved the proposed cabinet with 83 votes in favor out of 153 members and Kosor was confirmed as the first female Prime Minister of Croatia after independence - actually the third in the history of the republic after two female Prime Ministers of Socialist Republic of Croatia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.javno.com/en-croatia/kosor-approved-croatia-pm-vows-to-tackle-budget_268947|title=Kosor Approved Croatia PM, Vows To Tackle Budget|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2009-07-07|publisher=[[javno]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://hidran.hidra.hr/hidrarad/rh/rh6.htm | language = Croatian | title = Jedanaesta vlada | publisher = Croatian Information-Documentation Referral Agency | accessdate = 2010-12-10}}</ref> The [[Opposition (Croatia)|Opposition]] was not pleased with this development calling Sanader a coward and Kosor his puppet saying that an early general election was necessary.\n\n===Domestic policy===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2011}}\nIn the first month of her term Kosor, faced with a huge deficit and high unemployment, introduced an emergency budget aimed to reduce spending and the national debt. One of the most unpopular austerity measures taken along with the introduction of the budget was a new income tax called the \"crisis tax\" ({{lang|hr|krizni porez}}). In addition, the [[value-added tax]] rate was increased from 22% to 23%. Businesses criticized the tax hikes as well as the idea of tax code changes in the middle of the fiscal year as an unreasonable burden, while independent economists mostly noted how new taxes would cut consumer spending and further slow down the economy. The Opposition criticized the new measures heavily, calling the crisis tax ''[[hara\u010d]]'', a historical Turkish loanword representing a tax implemented during the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the late Middle Ages. Indeed, the government's handling of finances was unpopular among the public resulting in the Prime Minister's dismal approval rating of 32% by the end of her first month.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2009 many public officials as well as members of the boards of various government agencies became suspected of participating in corrupt activities. An unprecedented number of officials were detained and arrested under these allegations which resulted in both praise and criticism of Kosor's government. The praise was mostly directed by those who believed that the government had finally taken a stronger stance against political corruption, while others criticized the fact that most suspects were, in fact, members of Kosor's own [[Croatian Democratic Union]]. The Opposition accused the government, especially the Prime Minister, for political responsibility claiming that it was impossible that Kosor didn't know what was happening around her when she was a Vice President of the government almost seven years before becoming Prime Minister. The accusations grew louder as more and more corruption affairs were tied with the former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. On 30 October 2009 [[Damir Polan\u010dec]], member of the HDZ Presidency, resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy following allegations of corruption.\n\nOn 3 January 2010, Ivo Sanader announced he was returning to active politics saying it was a mistake he ever left. He accused Kosor and the members of the HDZ Presidency of failed leadership citing [[Andrija Hebrang (son)|Andrija Hebrang's]] poor result in the [[Croatian presidential election, 2009-2010|first round of the presidential election]] held just a week earlier. Hebrang achieved an embarrassing 12% claiming third place, the lowest result for an HDZ presidential candidate ever. [[Ivo Josipovi\u0107]], the candidate of the largest opposition party, the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]], won a landslide victory in the resulting runoff on 10 January. Most political pundits as well as the majority of the public believed the true reason of Sanader's surprise return was fear that he will eventually be tied with the numerous corruption scandals which have emerged since he left office. On 4 January, the day after Sanader's ''coup'' as it was called by the press, the HDZ Presidency decided to evict Sanader from the party. The Croatian public quickly rallied in support of Kosor against the hugely unpopular former prime minister, resulting in the highest support for any Prime Minister since polling began, topping at 77% by the end of February.\n\nThroughout 2010, economy topped corruption as the biggest concern of the government, and the enthusiasm for Kosor and her government soon wore off. Industry shed tens of thousands of jobs, and unemployment soared. Consumer spending reduced drastically compared to record 2007 levels, causing widespread problems in the trade as well as transport industries. The import/export balance did derive a benefit from a large decrease in imports and a more tempered decrease in exports. The continuing declining standard resulted in a quick fall in both the Prime Minister's as well as government's support. In June, Kosor proposed loosening the labor law and making it more business friendly. This was greatly opposed by the unions who have organized a petition against the proposed changes demanding a referendum on the issue. The petition was signed by over 700,000 citizens, unprecedented in Croatia. Just as the [[Croatian labour law referendum, 2010]] was being prepared, the government decided to drop the proposed changes. The [[Constitutional Court of Croatia|Constitutional Court]] ultimately declared the referendum issue moot, but ordered the government not to subject any changes to the labor law in the following year. This was seen as a legal way to avoid the referendum which many speculated would be a referendum on the Government rather than on the labor law. The unions criticized the move calling it undemocratic, announcing protests.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Outdated as of | topic = Gotovina and Marka\u010d guilty of war crimes }}\n[[File:EPP Summit March 2011 (71).jpg|right|thumb|Jadranka Kosor with her colleague, the [[German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]].]]\nJadranka Kosor signed an agreement with [[Borut Pahor]], the premier of [[Slovenia]], in November 2009, that ended [[Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession]] and allowed [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatian EU entry negotiations]] to proceed.\n\nIn August 2011, at the official celebration of [[Victory Day (Croatia)|Victory Day]], Kosor sent a public greeting to Croatian generals [[Ante Gotovina]] and [[Mladen Marka\u010d]] in particular.

Her [[PhD]] studies in Development Economics at the University of Paris 1970\u201373 were interrupted when she returned to Sri Lanka to enter politics, when her mother\u2019s government had launched a wide-ranging programme of socialist reform and development.<ref>President Kumaratunga, www.priu.gov.lk/execpres/bbk.html; Chandrika Kumaratunga, www.clubmadrid.org/en/miembro/chandrika_kumaratunga, both retrieved 7 Sept 2014</ref> During her days in France, it is reported that Chandrika was active in the [[May 1968 protests in France|Student Revolution of 1968]].<ref>BBC News, ''Profile: Chandrika Kumaratunga'', 26 August 2005</ref> She is fluent in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], English and French.<ref name=\"chandrika-bbc\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/566562.stm|title=Chandrika Kumaratunga: Politics in the blood|publisher=BBC News|date=9 October 2000}}</ref>\n\nShe married film star and Sri Lankan politician [[Vijaya Kumaranatunga|Vijaya Kumaratunga]] (also Kumaranatunga) in 1978.\n\n==Political career==\nUpon returning to Sri Lanka, she enrolled in and became active in the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party|Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)]] and, in 1974, became an executive committee member of its Women's League. Following the [[land reform]]s in Sri Lanka in 1972\u20131976, she was the principal director of the Land Reform Commission. From 1976 to 1977, she was chairman of the Janawasa Commission, which established [[collective farm]]s. From 1976 to 1979, she acted as a consultant to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations.\n\nShe stayed active in politics leaving the SLFP and supporting her husband's party, the [[Sri Lanka Mahajana Party]]. After Kumaratunga was [[Vijaya Kumaranatunga#Death and legend|assassinated]], she left the country for the UK, working for [[World Institute for Development Economics Research]] at the United Nations University in the interim, and not returning until 1991.\n\n===Premiership and presidency===\nOn return to Sri Lanka she rejoined SLFP and led her party to a historic and decisive victory at the southern provincial council elections. Kumaratunga was elected as the chief minister of the [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western Province of Sri Lanka]] in 1993 in a landslide election victory. Kumaratunga herself was [[Sri Lankan legislative election, 1994|elected]] prime minister of a [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|People's Alliance (PA)]] government from 19 August 1994 and won the [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 1994|presidential election]] held shortly thereafter in November. This ended 17 years of [[United National Party]] rule. She appointed her mother to succeed her as prime minister. Early in her term she made conciliatory moves towards the separatist [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|Tamil Tigers (LTTE)]] in an attempt to end the ongoing [[Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war]]. After these overtures failed, she later pursued a more military-based strategy against them.\n\nIn October 1999, Kumaratunga called an early [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 1999|presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/480270.stm | work=BBC News | title=Presidential poll in Sri Lanka | date=20 October 1999 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> She lost vision in her right eye (permanent optic nerve damage) in an assassination attempt, by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|Tamil Tigers]], at her final election rally at [[Colombo]] [[Town Hall]] premises on 18 December 1999.

She continued as [[president of Sri Lanka]] although her relationship with the Wickremasinghe government was a strained one.\n\nIn February 2002 Wickremasinghe's government and the LTTE signed a permanent [[ceasefire]] agreement, paving the way for talks to end the long-running conflict. In December, the government and the rebels agreed to share power during peace talks in Norway. President Kumaratunga believed Wickremasinghe was being too lenient towards the LTTE, and in May 2003 she indicated her willingness to sack the prime minister and government if she felt they were making too many concessions to the rebels. On 4 November 2003, while Prime Minister Wickremasinghe was on an official visit to the US, Kumaratunga prorogued Parliament and took over Defense, Interior and Media ministries herself. Her opponents criticised her, calling her behaviour dictatorial.<ref name=\"taking ministries\">{{cite news|url=hhttp://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/429874|title='Dictatorship' cries after parliament suspended|publisher=ABC Radio Australia|date=2012|access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nKumaratunga's PA and the leftist [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] or JVP (People's Liberation Front) formed the [[United People's Freedom Alliance|United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA)]] in January 2004 and dissolved Parliament. Having won the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 2004|election]] held on 2 April 2004 the UPFA formed a government with [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] as prime minister.

She argued that since the 1999 election had been held one year early, she should be allowed to serve that leftover year. Mahinda Rajapaksa succeeded her as president, leading all 25 parties in the UPFA.\n\n===Post-presidency===\nKumaratunga is a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international network of current and former female presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilise the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development. In November 2009, Kumaratunga was appointed to the 12-member board of directors of the [[Club de Madrid]]. She is a frequent panelist and member of the [[Clinton Foundation|Clinton Global Initiative]] and advisor to its annual meeting held every September.\n\nKumaratunga noted in 2007: \u2033I sincerely tried to reach a political consensus to solve the ethnic question, and tried to introduce a pluralistic constitution that would cater to the political aspirations of the Tamil people without dividing the country.\u2033<ref name=\"himal southasia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.himalmag.com/2007/october_november/chandrika_kumaratunga.html|title=The Queen ponders a return|publisher=HIMAL South Asian}}</ref>\n\nOn September 2009, Kumaratunga, on a personal visit to [[Kerala, India]] told reporters\n\"I too care for my life. Even though the current government is a government of my party (Sri Lanka Freedom Party) I don't feel safe.\" She continued, \"There is an overall lack of freedom and an atmosphere of fear prevails in the country.

It works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today\u2019s national leaders. It is a nonprofit organisation composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organisation officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of their concern.\n\n===Return to politics===\nOn 21 November 2014 Kumaratunga formally announced her return to active politics at a press conference held by the country's opposition coalition, following weeks of speculation regarding her involvement in the coalition's decision-making.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/56015/fresh-moves-by-cbk|title=Fresh moves by CBK|publisher=DailyMirror Sri Lanka|date=7 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asianmirror.lk/news/item/5121-chandrika-announces-her-return-to-active-politics-after-nine-years|title=Chandrika Announces Her Return To Active Politics After Nine Years|publisher=Asian Mirror|date=21 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nChandrika married movie star and politician [[Vijaya Kumaratunga]] in 1978.

In 1905, Moshe moved to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], in search of higher-paying work and found employment in the workshops of the local [[railroad yard]]. The following year, he had saved up enough money to bring his family to the United States.\n\n[[File:Golda Meir-Y.jpg|thumb|Golda Meir, before 1910]]\nBlume ran a grocery store on Milwaukee's north side, where by age eight Golda had been put in charge of watching the store when her mother went to the market for supplies. Golda attended the Fourth Street Grade School (now [[Golda Meir School]]) from 1906 to 1912. A leader early on, she organised a fund raiser to pay for her classmates' textbooks. After forming the American Young Sisters Society, she rented a hall and scheduled a public meeting for the event. She went on to graduate as [[valedictorian]] of her class.\n\nAt 14, she studied at [[North Division High School (Milwaukee)|North Division High School]] and worked part-time. Her mother wanted her to leave school and marry, but she demurred. She bought a train ticket to [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], and went to live with her married sister, Sheyna Korngold. The Korngolds held intellectual evenings at their home, where Meir was exposed to debates on [[Zionism]], literature, [[women's suffrage]], [[trade union]]ism, and more. In her autobiography, she wrote: \"To the extent that my own future convictions were shaped and given form [...] those talk-filled nights in Denver played a considerable role.\" In Denver, she also met Morris Meyerson (also 'Myerson'; December 17, 1893 \u2013 May 25, 1951), a sign painter, whom she later married on December 24, 1917.<ref name=MSCD>[https://www.msudenver.edu/golda/goldameir/chronologyofgoldameir/ Golda Meir: An Outline Of A Life] Metropolitan State College of Denver, mscd.edu; accessed November 22, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Return to Milwaukee, Zionist activism, and teaching==\n[[File:1914 Golda in Milwaukee.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Golda Meir in [[Milwaukee]], 1914]]\nIn 1913 she returned to North Division High, graduating in 1915. While there, she became an active member of Young [[Poale Zion]], which later became [[Habonim Dror|Habonim]], the [[Labor Zionist]] [[youth movement]]. She spoke at public meetings, embraced [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] and hosted visitors from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\nShe attended the [[normal school|teachers college]] [[Milwaukee State Normal School]] (now [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee]]), in 1916, and probably part of 1917. After graduating from Milwaukee Normal, she taught in [[Milwaukee Public Schools|Milwaukee public schools]].\n\nIn 1917 she took a position at a Yiddish-speaking [[Folk high school|Folks Schule]] in Milwaukee. While at the Folks Schule, she came more closely into contact with the ideals of Labor Zionism. In 1913 she had begun dating Morris Meyerson (Myerson). She was a committed [[Labor Zionist]] and he was a dedicated socialist. Together, they left their jobs to join a [[kibbutz]] in Palestine in 1921.\n\nWhen Golda and Morris married in 1917, settling in Palestine was her precondition for the marriage.<ref name=HA/> Golda had intended to make [[aliyah]] straight away but her plans were disrupted when all transatlantic passenger services were canceled due to the outbreak of [[World War I]].

Their first application to kibbutz [[Merhavia (kibbutz)|Merhavia]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]] was rejected, but later on they were accepted. Her duties included picking [[almond]]s, planting trees, working in the chicken coops, and running the kitchen. Recognizing her leadership abilities, the kibbutz chose her as its representative to the [[Histadrut]], the General Federation of Labour.\n\nIn 1924, the couple left the kibbutz and lived briefly in [[Tel Aviv]] before settling in [[Jerusalem]]. There they had two children, their son Menachem (1924-2014) and their daughter Sarah (1926-2010).\n\nIn 1928, Meir was elected secretary of ''Moetzet HaPoalot'' (Working Women's Council), which required her to spend two years (1932\u201334) as an emissary in the United States.<ref>Golda Meir, ''Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel'', ed.

Morris and Golda grew apart, but never divorced.<ref name=HA/> Morris died in 1951.\n\n==Histadrut activities==\nIn 1934, when Meir returned from the [[United States]], she joined the Executive Committee of the Histadrut and she moved up the ranks to become the head of its Political Department. This appointment was important training for her future role in Israeli leadership.<ref name=EJ>\"Golda Meir\", ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', Keter, 1972, Jerusalem, vol. 11, pp. 1242\u201345</ref>\n\nIn July 1938, Meir was the Jewish observer from Palestine at the [[\u00c9vian Conference]], called by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] of the United States to discuss the question of [[Jewish refugees]]' fleeing [[Nazi]] persecution. Delegates from the 32 invited countries repeatedly expressed their sorrow for the plight of the European Jews, but they made excuses as to why their countries could not help by admitting the refugees.\n\nThe only exception was by the [[Dominican Republic]], which pledged to accept 100,000 refugees on generous terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjhnyc.org/documents/sosua2.pdf |title=MJHnyc.org |format=PDF |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}</ref> Meir was disappointed at the outcome and she remarked to the press, \"There is only one thing I hope to see before I die and that is that my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore.\"<ref name=MSCD/>\n\n==Prestate political role==\nIn June 1946, the [[British Government]] cracked down on the Zionist movement in Palestine, arresting many leaders of the [[Yishuv]] (see [[Operation Agatha|Black Sabbath]]). Meir took over as acting head of the Political Department of the [[Jewish Agency]] during the incarceration of [[Moshe Sharett]]. Thus she became the principal negotiator between the Jews in Palestine and the British Mandatory authorities. After his release, Sharett went to the United States to attend talks on the [[UN Partition Plan]], leaving Meir to head the Political Department until the establishment of the state in 1948.<ref name=EJ/>\n\nIn January 1948, the treasurer of the Jewish Agency was convinced that Israel would not be able to raise more than seven to eight million dollars from the American Jewish community. Meir traveled to the United States, and she raised $50,000,000, which was used to purchase arms in Europe for the young country. Ben-Gurion wrote that Meir's role as the \"Jewish woman who got the money which made the state possible\" would go down one day in the history books.<ref name=HA/>\n\nOn May 10, 1948, four days before the official establishment of Israel, Meir traveled to [[Amman, Jordan]], disguised as an Arab woman for a secret meeting with [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]] of [[Jordan|Transjordan]] at which she urged him not to join the other Arab countries in attacking the Jews. Abdullah asked her not to hurry to proclaim a state. Meir replied: \"We've been waiting for 2,000 years. Is that hurrying?\"<ref>{{cite news    | title = Golda Meir: Peace and Arab Acceptance Were Goals of Her 5 Years as Premier    | work = New York Times    | date = December 9, 1978    | url = http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0503.html}}</ref>\n\nAs the head of the Jewish Agency Political Department, Meir called the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|mass exodus of Arabs]] before the War of Independence in 1948 \"dreadful\", and she likened it to what had befallen the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/books/review/Margolick-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=review Margolick, David. \"Endless War\" ''New York Times'', May 4, 2008]</ref>\n\n==Diplomatic and ministerial career==\n[[File:Evita y Golda Meir.jpg|thumb|Golda Meir talks with [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] in [[Argentina]], 1951.]]\n\nMeir was one of 24 signatories (including two women) of the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli Declaration of Independence]] on May 14, 1948. She later recalled, \"After I signed, I cried. When I studied American history as a schoolgirl and I read about those who signed the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]], I couldn't imagine these were real people doing something real. And there I was sitting down and signing a declaration of establishment.\" Israel was attacked the next day by the joint armies of neighboring countries in what became the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]].

The Alignment managed what is still the best showing for a single party or faction in Israeli history, winning 56 seats\u2014the only time a party or faction has even approached winning an outright majority in an election. The national unity government was retained.\n\nIn 1969 and the early 1970s, Meir met with many world leaders to promote her vision of peace in the Middle East, including [[Richard Nixon]] (1969), [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] (1972) and [[Pope Paul&nbsp;VI]] (1973). In 1973, she hosted the chancellor of West Germany, [[Willy Brandt]], in Israel.<ref name=\"micropedia\" />\n\nIn August 1970, Meir accepted a U.S. peace initiative that called for an end to the [[War of Attrition]] and an Israeli pledge to withdraw to \"secure and recognized boundaries\" in the framework of a comprehensive peace settlement.

When seven of these emigrants [[Schoenau ultimatum|were taken hostage]] at the Austria-[[Czechoslovakia]]n border by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militants in September 1973, the [[Chancellor of Austria]], [[Bruno Kreisky]], closed the Jewish Agency's transit facility in [[Sch\u00f6nau an der Triesting|Sch\u00f6nau]], [[Austria]]. A few days later in [[Vienna]], Meir tried to convince Kreisky to reopen the facility by appealing to his own Jewish origin, and described his position as \"succumbing to terrorist blackmail\".

However, on October 5, 1973, Meir received official news that Syrian forces were massing on the [[Golan Heights]]. The prime minister was alarmed by the reports, and felt that the situation reminded her of what happened before the [[Six Day War]]. Her advisers, however, assured her not to worry, saying that they would have adequate notice before a war broke out. This made sense at the time, since after the Six Day War, most Israelis felt it unlikely that the Arabs would attack. Consequently, although a resolution was passed granting her power to demand a full-scale call-up of the military (instead of the typical cabinet decision), Meir did not mobilize Israel's forces early. Soon, though, war became very clear. Six hours before the outbreak of hostilities, Meir met with Minister of Defense [[Moshe Dayan]] and general [[David Elazar]]. While Dayan continued to argue that war was unlikely and thus was in favor of calling up the air force and only two divisions, Elazar advocated full scale army mobilization and the launch of a full-scale preemptive strike on Syrian forces.<ref>[http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/9565.html Interview with Abraham Rabinovich: The Yom Kippur War as a Turning Point], History News Network</ref>\n\nMeir approved full scale mobilizing but sided with Dayan against a preemptive strike, citing Israel's need for foreign aid. She believed that Israel could not depend on European countries to supply Israel with military equipment, and the only country that might come to Israel's assistance was the [[Israel\u2013United States relations|United States]]. Fearing that the United States would be wary of intervening if Israel were perceived as initiating the hostilities, Meir decided early on October 6 against a preemptive strike. She made it a priority to inform Washington of her decision. [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] later confirmed Meir's assessment by stating that if Israel had launched a preemptive strike, Israel would not have received \"so much as a nail\".<ref name=ml/><ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB98/octwar-10.pdf The national security archive,declassified archival records, The October War and U.S. Policy ]</ref>\n\n===Resignation===\nFollowing the Yom Kippur War, Meir's government was plagued by infighting and questions over Israel's lack of preparation for the war.

The Australian actress [[Judy Davis]] played a young Meir in the [[made-for-television|television]] film ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982), opposite [[Leonard Nimoy]]. [[Ingrid Bergman]] played the older Meir in the same film. In 2003, [[American Jews|American Jewish]] actress [[Tovah Feldshuh]] portrayed her on Broadway in ''[[Golda's Balcony]]'', Gibson's second play about Meir's life. The one-woman show was controversial in its implication that Meir considered using [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear weapons]] during the Yom Kippur War.\n\n[[Valerie Harper]] portrayed her in the touring company production and in the film version of ''Golda's Balcony''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0860418/ IMDb.com]</ref> Actress [[Colleen Dewhurst]] portrayed her in the 1986 TV movie ''[[Sword of Gideon]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092038/ IMDb.com]</ref> In 2005 actress [[Lynn Cohen]] portrayed Meir in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]].''\n\nTovah Feldshuh assumed the role of Meir once again in the 2006 English-speaking French movie ''[[O Jerusalem (film)|O&nbsp;Jerusalem]]''.

Before becoming [[head of government]], Maria das Neves worked as a [[civil servant]] in the [[Ministry of Finance]], in the [[World Bank]] and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF). She married and when her two daughters had grown up, she held major government posts: Minister of [[Economics]] (1999-2001), Minister of [[Finance]] 2001/02 and Minister of [[Trade]], [[Industry]], and [[Tourism]] (2002). \n\nIn 2001 Fradique de Menezes was elected President with support of the Centre Party. But there was no clear majority in parliament, and the result was an unstable cohabitation with a number of short-lived cabinets headed by the opposition. A three party coalition was formed under the socialist Gabriel Costa and das Neves was member of the government.<ref>Skard, Torild (2014) \"Maria das Neves\" in ''Women of power - half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, ISBN 978-1-44731-578-0, pp. 299-300</ref> \n\n==Prime Minister of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe==\n\nShe held the post of Prime Minister from 7 October 2002 until 18 September 2004, and was the nation's first [[female]] head of government. President [[Fradique de Menezes]] appointed das Neves as Prime Minister after the three-party Government of National Unity led by [[Gabriel Costa]] collapsed following complaints from the [[army]] over recent promotions. The country was in a difficult situation, being heavily indebted and dependent on aid. There were disagreements and power struggles. When an oil agreement was signed with Nigeria, there was a military coup on 16 July 2003. The President was abroad and the army and mercenaries took action, arresting das Neves and other government officials. The coup leaders complained about corruption and said that the forthcoming oil revenues would not be distributed fairly. Following international pressure, an agreement was reached and Menezes reinstated after a week. das Neves    \nwas hospitalized after suffering a mild [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. She resigned as Prime Minister, but accepted to continue when President Menezes reaffirmed his confidence in her. <ref>Jensen, Jane S. (2008) \"Maria das Neves\" in ''Women Political Leaders - breaking the highest glass ceiling'', New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan, ISBN 978-0-312-22338-0, p. 58; Skard (2014), pp. 299-300</ref>\n\nPresident Menezes dismissed her from the post on 15 September 2004 and asked her party to choose a new Prime Minister, after allegations of corruption were brought against her and members of her government. She denied participating in any corrupt practices. Three days after her dismissal, a new government led by [[Dami\u00e3o Vaz d'Almeida]] was sworn in. Das Neves was elected an alternate to parliament and became an MP.\n\n==Afterwards== \n\nMaria das Neves is a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international network of current and

But under its prime minister,  Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis, the country has an opportunity to make substantial and sustainable gains in both economics and politics. Her domestic achievements are already considerable, holding together a diverse coalition and quelling a determined opposition. Abroad, she has worked well with international leaders and won some influential friends, including [[Bill Clinton]], a former US president. The tenure of Ms Pierre-Louis, whose social-activist brother-in-law was assassinated in 1998, may conceivably mark a turning-point in the country's long battle with extreme poverty, bloody confrontation and deep-rooted social injustice.</blockquote> [http://www.economist.com/theworldin/forecasts/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14888200 article].\n\nAfter a year senators from Pr\u00e9val's party complained that people's living standards were not improving.Others thought it was unfair to place the blame on Pierre-Louis for 200 years of poverty and social inequality, but the prime minister and her cabinet were voted down and out on 11 November 2009.<ref>Skard (2014), p. 267</ref> \n\nIn the wake of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] Pierre-Louis wrote a piece for the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' outlining her vision for a three-phase plan for the community: rescue, recovery and reconstruction.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pierre-Louis|first=Mich\u00e8le|title=My Pride and Hope for Haiti|publisher=''Huffington Post''|date=2010-01-25|accessdate=2010-02-08|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michele-pierrelouis/my-pride-and-hope-for-hai_b_435398.html}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis}}\n*[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=47515 \"The Elites Are Like a Huge Elephant Sitting on Haiti\" Michael Deibert interviews Haitian Prime Minister Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Jacques-\u00c9douard Alexis]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Prime Minister of Haiti]]|years=2008\u20132009}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Jean-Max Bellerive]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Prime Ministers of Haiti}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pierre-Louis, Michele}}\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:Female heads of government]]\n[[Category:Haitian people of Mulatto descent]]\n[[Category:Haitian women in politics]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Haiti]]\n[[Category:Women prime ministers]]"}]},"806208":{"pageid":806208,"ns":0,"title":"Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{Portuguese name|Ruivo da Silva|Matos Pintasilgo}}\n{{Infobox Officeholder\n|name             = Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo\n|honorific-suffix = <small>[[Order of Prince Henry|GCIH]] [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|GCC]]\n|image            = Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo 1986 (cropped).jpg\n|office           = [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|108th]] [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]\n|president        = [[Ant\u00f3nio Ramalho Eanes]]\n|term_start       = 1 August 1979\n|term_end         = 3 January 1980\n|predecessor      = [[Carlos Mota Pinto]]\n|successor        = [[Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro]]\n|office2          = Consultant of the President of the Republic\n|term_start2      = 1 October 1981\n|term_end2        = 1 February 1985\n|president2       = [[Ant\u00f3nio Ramalho Eanes]]\n|office3          = Minister of Social Affairs\n|term_start3      = 17 July 1974\n|term_end3        = 26 March 1975\n|primeminister3   = [[Vasco Gon\u00e7alves]]\n|predecessor3     = M\u00e1rio Murteira\n|successor3       = Jorge S\u00e1 Borges\n|birth_date       = {{birth date|1930|1|18|df=y}}\n|birth_place      = [[Abrantes]], [[Portugal]]\n|death_date       = {{death date and age|2004|7|10|1930|1|18|df=y}}\n|death_place      = [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]\n|party            = Independent\n|alma_mater       = [[Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico]]\n|profession       = [[Chemical engineer]]\n|religion         = [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]\n}}\n'''Maria de Lourdes Ruivo da Silva de Matos Pintasilgo''', <small>[[Order of Prince Henry|GCIH]] [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|GCC]]</small> ({{IPA-pt|m\u0250\u02c8\u027ei\u0250 d\u0268 \u02c8lu\u027ed\u0268\u0283 p\u0129t\u0250\u02c8si\u026b\u0261u}}); ([[Abrantes]], [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (Abrantes)|S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista]], 18 January 1930 \u2013 Lisbon, 10 July 2004) was a Portuguese chemical engineer and politician.

From 1981\u20131986, she worked in [[West Germany]].\n\nShe ran in the [[Lithuanian presidential election, 2004]] against  [[Valdas Adamkus]], hoping to receive votes from supporters of impeached president [[Rolandas Paksas]]. She finished in second place in the first round and was defeated in the runoff.\n\nPrunskien\u0117 is also a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an International network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nPrunskien\u0117 was born as Kazimira Danut\u0117 Stankevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 in the village of Vasiuli\u0161kiai. Her father, Pranas Stankevi\u010dius, worked as a forest ranger and owned several hectares of land.<ref>Opfell. pgs. 161-168</ref> Known as a jolly musician who played at many instruments at country weddings, including the [[guitar]], [[fiddle]], [[concertina]], and a pipe of his own making, Stankevi\u010dius was killed by the [[NKVD]] in the Labanoras Forest when Kazimira was just one year old.\n\nPrunskien\u0117 attended the [[Vilnius University]], earning her degree in economics in 1965 and later earned her doctorate from the same university in the same subject during the late 1980s. Afterwards she stayed on at the university as first an instructor, then as a senior associate in the department of industrial economics.<ref>Opfell Pgs. 161-168</ref>\n\nBefore getting her first degree, Prunskien\u0117 married Povilas Prunskus. Between 1963 and 1971 she bore three children\u2014a son named Vaidotas and two daughters called Rasa and Daivita. She would later divorce her first husband and remarried in 1989 to Algimantas Tarvidas.<ref>Opfell, pp. 161-168.</ref>\n\n== Political career ==\n\nPrunskien\u0117 shifted slowly from university to government circles. Joining the Lithuanian Communist Party in 1980, by 1986 she began acting as the deputy director for the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic's Agricultural Economics Research Institute.<ref>Opfell. Pgs. 161-168</ref> In 1988 Prunskien\u0117 helped found the grass-roots Lithuanian restructuring movement [[S\u0105j\u016bdis]], which eventually grew into Lithuania's leading pro-independence group<ref>Smith. Pg. 120</ref>\nShe was elected to the position of the Prime Minister of the [[Prunskien\u0117 Cabinet|first government]] on 17 March by the [[Supreme Council of Lithuania]] and immediately faced the problems brought on by an economic embargo set in place by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in an attempt to force Lithuania back under control of the crumbling USSR. Prunskien\u0117 flew to countries all over the world, including the United States, to try to gain support for negotiations with Gorbachev about the embargo through such committees as the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Helsinki Commission]].<ref>Implementation of the Helsinki Accords</ref> After nine months in office, Prunskien\u0117 resigned and now heads the Department of Agriculture in Lithuania. She also is currently the leader of the [[National Farmer's Party]].<ref>The Baltic News Service</ref>\n\n== KGB allegations ==\n\nIt was alleged that Prunskien\u0117 served in the Soviet [[KGB]] under the alias \"\u0160atrija\". These were challenged in the courts. A lengthy and controversial trial resulted in Prunskien\u0117's legal victory, but she is nevertheless often associated with the Russian influence in Lithuanian politics.\n\n== Writings ==\n\nAt the Vital Voices Conferences, held on 10 July 1997 in Vienna, Austria, Prunskien\u0117 published ''The Role Of Women In Democracy: The Experience Of Lithuania''.

Entering parliament at age 35, she was one of parliament's youngest members.<ref name=\"wolfe\" />  She represented this electorate until her retirement from politics in 2002, though it was renamed [[Rakaia (New Zealand electorate)|Rakaia]] in 1990.\n\n===Cabinet Minister===\nShipley rose quickly in the National caucus.  While still in her second term, party leader [[Jim Bolger]] named her the party's spokeswoman on social welfare.  When Bolger led the National Party to victory in the [[New Zealand general election, 1990|general election of 1990]], Shipley became Minister of Social Welfare, and also served as [[Minister for Women's Affairs]] (1990\u20131996).<ref>{{cite web |title=Minister of Women's Affairs |url=http://www.mwa.govt.nz/about/minister-of-wa |publisher=Ministry of Women's Affairs|accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn her role as Minister of Social Welfare, Shipley presided over sharp cutbacks to state benefits. Later, when she became [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]] in 1993, she caused further controversy by attempting to reform the public health service, introducing an internal market. When National gained re-election in [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996]], Shipley left the Women's Affairs portfolio and took on several others, including responsibility for [[State-owned enterprises of New Zealand|state-owned enterprises]] and [[Minister of Transport (New Zealand)|transport]].\n\n===Prime Minister===\n{{main|Fourth National Government of New Zealand}}\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:Clinton Shipley walk.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Shipley (centre) with [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]], 15 September 1999.]]\n\nShipley grew increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with the cautious pace of National's leader, [[Jim Bolger]], and with what she saw as the disproportionate influence of coalition partner [[New Zealand First]]. She began gathering support to replace Bolger in mid-1997. Later that year, while Bolger attended the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1997|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]], Shipley convinced a majority of her National Party colleagues to back her bid for the leadership. Bolger, seeing that he no longer had the support of his party, resigned, and Shipley replaced him. As leader of the governing party, she became Prime Minister on 8 December 1997.\n\nDespite continued economic growth, the Shipley government became increasingly politically unstable. In particular, the relationship between National and New Zealand First deteriorated. While Bolger had been able to maintain good relations with New Zealand First and with its leader, [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Winston Peters]], the alliance became strained after Shipley rose to power. Finally, on 14 August 1998, Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet.\n\nPeters immediately withdrew support for Shipley's government. However, several New Zealand First MPs wanted to continue the coalition, and led by NZF deputy leader [[Tau Henare]] they tried to oust Peters as leader. When they failed, they left their party, either becoming independents or trying to form their own parties. Shipley gained sufficient support from these MPs to keep National in power. On the same day Shipley unexpectedly backed Cultural Affairs Minister [[Marie Hasler]]'s call for a change in the [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand flag]].\n\nShipley, along with the [[New Zealand Tourism Board]], backed the quasi-national emblem of the [[Cyathea dealbata|silver fern]] on a black background as a possible alternative flag, along the lines of the [[Canadian flag]], but she took pains to publicly disassociate herself from Bolger's support for [[Republicanism in New Zealand|republicanism]]. As the debate continued in 1999, the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] visited New Zealand, and Shipley stated, \"I am an unashamed royal supporter, along with many New Zealanders.\" However, the debate was muted by the controversy surrounding Tourism Board contracts going to the public-relations firm [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose World CEO [[Kevin Roberts (businessman)|Kevin Roberts]], also an advocate of the [[silver fern flag]], was a good friend of Shipley. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thestandard.org.nz/standfornz-when-social-media-goes-bad/ |title=Standfornz \u2013 when social media goes bad \u00ab The Standard |publisher=Thestandard.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}</ref>\n\nShe was the first Prime Minister to attend the gay and lesbian [[Hero Parade]], being the first National Party leader to seek to make electoral overtures to the gay and lesbian voting public. She advocated lowering the [[Legal drinking age#Oceania|alcohol purchase age]] from 20 to 18 and achieved this in 1999. This was part of her expressed desire to expand the traditional National Party voting base.\n\nShipley became a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers with the mission of mobilising the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.\n\n==Privy Council==\nOn 21 May 1998 Shipley was appointed to the [[Member of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] and became [[The Right Honourable#New Zealand|The Right Honourable]] Jenny Shipley.<ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/95eed1350fc35903cc256d2500572b68!OpenDocument Appointments to the Privy Council] (28 May 1998) 74 ''New Zealand'' 1613 at 1644.</ref>\n\n==Defeat and resignation==\nShipley led the National Party into the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 election]], hoping to become the first woman to be elected prime minister in her own right.

The PNP boycotted [[Jamaican general election, 1983|the elections called in 1983]]. She was re-elected to the same seat [[Jamaican general election, 1989|in a later election]], and served as Minister of Labour, Welfare and Sports from 1989 to 1993. She was Minister of Labour and Welfare from 1993 to 1995, Minister of Labour, Social Security and Sports from 1995 to February 2000, Minister of Tourism and Sports from February 2000 to October 2002, and Minister of Local Government and Sport since October 2002.<ref>[http://www.jis.gov.jm/Minister%20Profiles/html/9.htm The Hon.

In July 2008, Simpson-Miller was challenged for the presidency of the PNP by Phillips. The election was held among the party's delegates on 20 September. She was re-elected as the head of the PNP for her second consecutive year, defeating him by an even wider margin than that of the previous election.\n\n===Prime minister===\nShe replaced Patterson as prime minister on 30 March 2006, becoming the first female head of government of the nation<ref>[http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/Jamaicas-First-Female-PM.html Jamaica's First Female Prime Minister], retrieved on 28 May 2007.</ref> and the third in the Anglophone Caribbean, following [[Eugenia Charles]] of [[Dominica]] and [[Janet Jagan]] of [[Guyana]]. In organising the cabinet following her swearing-in, she assumed the portfolio of [[defence minister]].\n\n====2007 elections====\n{{Main|Jamaican general election, 2007}}\nOn 3 September 2007, Simpson-Miller's party narrowly lost [[Jamaican general election, 2007|the general election]], retaining 27 seats against the rival [[Jamaican Labour Party]]'s 33 seats. This margin was revised to 32\u201328 after recounts and an election petition decision concerning the eligibility of a government MP who had [[dual citizenship]].\n\nThe loss can in part be attributed to a well planned and executed campaign by the JLP. A part of their campaign strategy was a media blitz that claimed to highlight 18 years of neglect under the PNP and the incompetence of Simpson-Miller as a leader. One advertisement highlighted the deplorable conditions in Simpson-Miller\u2019s own constituency of South West St. Andrew<ref>{{Youtube|7u9GC303j9Q|JLP TV Ads \u2013 Majesty Gardens}}</ref> while others were created from controversial interviews<ref>{{Youtube|jegKPdHE3sg|JLP TV Ads \u2013 We Found Money \u2013 Portia}}</ref> and still others discussed issues surrounding her competence as a leader.<ref>{{Youtube|SacTRnynF4M|JLP TV Ad \u2013 Dont Draw Mi Tongue}}</ref>\n\nSimpson-Miller initially refused to concede defeat, alleging voting irregularities and the possibility that recounts would change the final result.

Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]. She is the first  woman to hold this post in Poland (with [[Ewa Kopacz]] and [[Beata Szyd\u0142o]] holding the post in the 2010s) and was the 14th woman to be appointed and serve as prime minister in the world.<ref>Skard, Torild (2014) \"Hanna Suchocka\" in ''Women of Power - Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, ISBN 978-1-44731-578-0</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSuchocka was born in [[Pleszew]], Poland, in a Catholic family of chemists. Her grandfather was a University teacher and her grandmother Anna became member of the first Polish parliament after independence in 1918, when women got the right to vote. Suchocka went to law school and became a researcher at the University of Poznan but she was fired when she refused to join the Communist party. She was preoccupied by human rights and undertook a PhD in [[Constitutional Law]] in West Germany in 1975.\n\nIn 1969 she joined a small non-Marxist '[[Bloc party (politics)#Poland|satellite party]]', the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Democratic Party]] (SD), and was a member of parliament the [[Sejm]] of [[People's Republic of Poland]] in 1980-1985. At the same time she was a member and a legal advisor to ''[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]''. She was one of only a few MPs who did not to vote in favour of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] in 1981 and the criminalisation of ''Solidarity'' in 1984. The party suspended her (or she resigned), but with the support of ''Solidarity'' she was reelected to parliament in 1989. When Solidarity supporters split up into several political parties, Suchocka joined the centre-liberal [[Democratic Union (Poland)|Democratic Union]] (DU) and was re-elected to parliament in 1991.\n\n==Prime Minister==\nShe became Prime Minister in 1992. Governments at the time were based on various coalitions and changed constantly. Suchocka was chosen to the amazement of many male politicians but she was known for her low profile and willingness to make compromises and promote reconciliation. She could be accepted by people who had antipathy towards more prominent leaders of DU. In addition, as a left-winger, while being opposed to abortion as a Catholic, she could be accepted by both sides of the political spectrum and satisfy the interests of a majority in a parliament consisting of seven parties, including a Christian and a liberal party.<ref>Opfell (1993) \"Hanna Suchocka\" in ''Women prime ministers and presidents'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co, ISBN 978-0899507903, pp. 212-22; Skard, Torild (2014) \"Hanna Suchocka\" in ''Women of power - Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, ISBN 978-1-44731-578-0, pp. 344-5</ref>\n\nHanna Suchocka declared that her government was for social reconciliation and would lead the country forward in the transformation from communism to capitalism. She was approved by 233 against 61 votes and 113 abstentions<ref>''Current Biography'' 1994, January, New York, NY: H.W.Wilson, pp 50-3</ref> She quickly formed a cabinet, but it didn't include any other female ministers, although she wanted them. None of the coalition partners were willing to accept another woman and she got two male deputy prime ministers. She stayed longer as prime minister than any of her four predecessors, but she did not stay long. There was a wave of strikes and Suchocka was a warm supporter of market reforms and followed a hard line against the strikers. When she wouldn't give salary increases to teachers and health workers, parliament passed a vote of no-confidence by a majority of one vote. Wa\u0142\u0119sa dissolved parliament and held new elections and Suchocka resigned as soon as the new parliament was in place.<ref>Lewis, Jone Johnson (1992) ''Hanna Suchocka government'', October, www.womenshistory.about.com and ''Who's Who in Poland, Directory of members of parliament, state and local government and the presidential chancellery 1994-1995'', (1994) Warsaw, p.II-497</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Hanna Suchocka, Prime Minister of Poland 1992-1993.jpg|Official portrait during her premiership\n</gallery>\n\n==Later career==\n\nIn 1994 Hanna Suchocka was one of the founders of a liberal and social-democratic Liberty Union party, which became the country's third largest political force.

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have held the office. A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] journalist dubbed her the \"[[Iron Lady]]\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as [[Thatcherism]].\n\nOriginally a research [[chemistry|chemist]] before becoming a [[barrister]], Thatcher was [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1959|elected Member of Parliament]] for [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]]. [[Edward Heath]] appointed her [[Secretary of State for Education|Secretary of State for Education and Science]] in his [[Heath ministry|1970 government]]. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975|Conservative Party leadership election]] to become [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].\n\nOn moving into {{nowrap|[[10 Downing Street]]}}, Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the [[Winter of Discontent]] and an ongoing recession.{{refn|In her foreword to the 1979 Conservative manifesto, Thatcher wrote of \"a feeling of helplessness, that a once great nation has somehow fallen behind\".<ref>{{cite web|work=Foreword|title=Conservative Party Manifesto 1979|url=http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml|last=Thatcher|first=Margaret|publisher=conservativemanifesto.com|year=1979|accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref>|group=nb}} Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised [[deregulation]] (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of [[state-owned enterprise|state-owned companies]], and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment, until victory in the 1982 [[Falklands War]] and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|re-election in 1983]].\n\nThatcher was re-elected for a third term [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|in 1987]]. During this period her support for a [[Community Charge]] (referred to as the \"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and her views on the [[European Economic Community|European Community]] were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after [[Michael Heseltine]] launched a [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|challenge to her leadership]]. After retiring from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]] in 1992, she was given a [[life peer]]age as Baroness Thatcher, of [[Kesteven]] in the county of [[Lincolnshire]], which entitled her to sit in the [[House of Lords]].

It turned out that from 2000 to 2008 Thorning-Schmidt had made use of tax deductions applicable to her husband, even though he was not subject to Danish taxes and had no income in Denmark. The mistake was corrected by SKAT for the three years from 2006 to 2008, and Thorning-Schmidt paid the amount she had saved due to the error. She was however not required to pay the amounts saved for the six years from 2000 to 2005, because of the statutory time limit for liability in such cases.<ref>[http://www.bt.dk/politik/thorning-fik-uberettiget-fradrag-i-seks-aar/ Thorning fik uberettiget fradrag i seks \u00e5r], [[B.T.

This would be unlawful under Danish law as the Tax Ministry may not interfere with the decisions taken in individual tax cases.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1447272/ministers-hoejre-haand-skrev-afsnit-i-thorning-sag/ Ministers h\u00f8jre h\u00e5nd skrev afsnit i Thorning-sag], [[Politiken]] 11 November 2011</ref> This set off a flurry of speculation in the press, as to whether there had been any political pressure from the then government to pursue a stricter course in the tax case. Tax Minister in the new government Thor M\u00f6ger Pedersen subsequently asked Peter Loft and the director of the revenue service's Copenhagen branch, Erling Andersen, to give a report on the happenings. On 2 December, Pedersen disclosed that he had found such big discrepancies in the two reports that he would set up a commission of inquiry to determine the actual course of events.<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2011/12/02/093947.htm/ Kommission skal kulegrave skattesag], [[Danmarks Radio|DR]] 2 December 2011</ref>\n\nFurther controversy erupted when two days later the tabloid daily, ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'', reported that they had also been offered the confidential information that was made public during the election campaign. The source of the leak was determined to be Peter Arnfeldt, spin doctor for then Minister for Taxation [[Troels Lund Poulsen]].<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1469714/avis-troels-lunds-spindoktor-ville-laekke-thornings-skattepapirer/ Avis: Troels Lunds spindoktor ville l\u00e6kke Thornings skattepapirer], [[Politiken]] 4 December 2011 {{da icon}}</ref> This led to intense media speculation that the former government, and specifically Troels Lund Poulsen, were engaged in leaking confidential tax information and trying to pressure the revenue service into changing its decision in the case, in an active attempt to discredit the opposition leader in the then imminent election. This would constitute a hitherto unseen level of abuse of power in Danish political life. The commission of inquiry that had already been announced two days previously, was broadly supported by the Danish Parliament to also look into whether the former government was involved in, or knew of, the leak.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1470465/undersoegelseskommissionen-ventes-klar-hurtigt/ Unders\u00f8gelseskommissionen ventes klar hurtigt], [[Politiken]] 5 December 2011</ref> On the same day Troels Lund Poulsen announced he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from the Danish Parliament.

She served as [[Prime Minister of Rwanda]] from 18 July 1993 until her assassination on 7 April 1994, during the opening stages of the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. She was Rwanda's first and so far only female prime minister.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nAgathe Uwilingiyimana, one of the most influential women in Rwandan history, was born in 1953 in the village of Nyaruhengeri, some 140&nbsp;km southeast of [[Kigali]], Rwanda's capital city, to farming parents. Shortly after she was born the family emigrated from [[Butare]] to work in the [[Belgian Congo]]. Her father moved the family back to Butare when Uwilingiyimana was four. After success in public examinations she was educated at Notre Dame des C\u00eeteaux Secondary School, and obtained the certificate to teach [[humanities]] at 20.\n\nIn 1976 she received a secondary school diploma in mathematics and chemistry. She became a mathematics teacher in [[Butare]]. In the same year she married Ignace Barahira, a fellow student from her village. Their first child was born later in the year; they would go on to have five children.\n\nIn 1983 she taught chemistry at the [[National University of Rwanda]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}. This was financially possible because her husband obtained a post at the university laboratory at twice the salary of a math teacher. She received a B.Sc. in 1985{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}, and taught chemistry for four years in Butare academic schools. Rwandan media was later critical of her scientific education, as it was thought that girls should not study science.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\n== Rise to prime minister ==\n\nIn 1986 she created a Soriority and Credit Cooperative Society among the staff of the Butare academic school, and her high-profile role in the self-help organization brought her to the attention of the Kigali authorities, who wanted to appoint decision makers from the discontented south of the country. In 1989 she became a director in the Ministry of Commerce.\n\nShe joined the [[Republican Democratic Movement]] (MDR), an opposition party, in 1992, and four months later was appointed Minister of Education by [[Dismas Nsengiyaremye]], the first opposition prime minister under a power-sharing scheme negotiated between President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] and five major opposition parties. As education minister she abolished the academic ethnic quota system, awarding public school places and scholarships by open merit ranking. This decision earned her the enmity of the Hutu-extremist parties.\n\nOn 17 July 1993, after a meeting between President Habyarimana and all five parties, Agathe Uwilingiyimana became the first woman prime minister of Rwanda, replacing Dr Nsengiyaremye, the man who had appointed her Minister of Education, and whose exoneration of the president was unpopular with the other parties. Since Uwilingiyimana didn't have the power base of the other candidates, and was not wanted by Habyarimana most observers{{Who|date=October 2008}} believe that her appointment as prime minister was based on the political calculation by the President that she would divide the opposition, and by the opposition that she would be controllable. On the day of her appointment, Nsengiyareme suspended Uwilingiyimana's MDR membership. (The MDR had opposed the formation of any interim government excluding the rebel [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|\nRPF]].)\n\n== Arusha Accords ==\n\nThe Habyarimana\u2013Uwilingiyimana government was still [[Hutu]] dominated, and had the daunting task of successfully negotiating a peace accord with the rebel [[Rwandese Patriotic Front]] (RPF), the [[Tutsi]]-dominated guerilla movement. An agreement between Habyarimana, the five opposition parties (led ostensibly by Uwilingiyimana), and the RPF, was finally reached on 4 August 1993. Under the \"[[Arusha Accords]]\", Habyarimana's ruling [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development|MRND]] would take the transitional presidency, and the Prime Minister would come from the MDR. Since the MDR had suspended Uwilingiyimana they chose [[Faustin Twagiramungu]] (who had been instrumental in suspending her) to replace her.\n\n== Caretaker prime minister ==\n\nPresident Habyarimana officially dismissed her as Prime Minister eighteen days after her appointment to the office, but she stayed on in a caretaker capacity for eight months, until her death in April 1994. This was despite being excoriated by all the Hutu-dominated parties, including her own MDR, and President Habyrimana's ruling party, which held a press conference in January 1994 attacking Uwilingiyimana for being a \"political trickster\".\n\nThe swearing in of the \"Broad Based Transitional Government\", or BBTG, was to have taken place on 25 March 1994. At that point, Uwilingiyimana was to have stepped down in favor of Faustin Twagiramungu, having been guaranteed a lower level ministerial post in the new government. However, the RPF did not appear at the ceremony, postponing the establishment of the new regime. She reached agreement with them that the new government would be sworn in on the following day.\n\n== Assassination ==\nThe talks between President Habyarimana, Uwilingiyimana, and the Rwandan Patriotic Front were never concluded and the president's plane was [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|shot down by rockets at around 8:30 pm on 6 April 1994]].  From Habyarimana's death until her assassination the following morning (approximately 14 hours), Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana was Rwanda's constitutional head of government.\n\nIn an interview with [[Radio France]] on the night of President Habyarimana's assassination, Uwilingiyimana said that there would be an immediate investigation. She also said, in her last recorded words:\n<blockquote>There is shooting, people are being terrorized, people are inside their homes lying on the floor. We are suffering the consequences of the death of the head of state, I believe. We, the civilians, are in no way responsible for the death of our head of state.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|U.N. peacekeeping force]] sent a [[Belgium|Belgian]] escort to her home before 3 am the following morning; they intended to take her to [[Radio Rwanda]], from where she planned a dawn broadcast appealing for national calm. Uwilingiyimana's house was further guarded by five Ghanaian U.N. troops on the outside in addition to the ten Belgian troops. Inside the house, the family was protected by the Rwandan presidential guard, but between 6:55 and 7:15 am the presidential guard surrounded the U.N. troops and told them to lay down their arms. Fatally, the blue berets ultimately complied, handing over their weapons just before 9 am.\n\nSeeing the stand-off outside her home, Agathe Uwilingiyimana and her family took refuge in the Kigali U.N. volunteer compound around 8 am. Eyewitnesses to the inquiry on U.N. actions say that Rwandan soldiers entered the compound at 10 am, and searched it for Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  Fearing for the lives of her children, Agathe and her husband emerged, and they were shot and killed by the presidential guard on the morning of 7 April 1994. Her children escaped and eventually took refuge in [[Switzerland]].  In his book, ''[[Me Against My Brother]]'', [[Scott Peterson (writer)|Scott Peterson]] writes that the U.N. troops sent to protect Uwilingiyimana were castrated, gagged with their own genitalia, and then murdered.\n\nIn his book ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (book)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'', U.N. commander [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]] writes that Uwilingiyimana and her husband surrendered themselves to the genocidaires to save their children, who stayed successfully hidden in the adjoining housing compound for employees of the [[United Nations Development Programme]]. The children survived and were picked up by Captain [[Mbaye Diagne]], a [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|UNAMIR]] military observer, who smuggled them into the [[H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines]].<ref>[[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]], ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (book)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'', Carroll & Graf: New York, 2003, ISBN 0-7867-1510-3, pp. 245-246, 268</ref> They were eventually resettled in Switzerland.\n\nMajor [[Bernard Ntuyahaga]] was indicted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) for the murder of Uwilingiyimana and the U.N. peacekeepers, but the charges were dropped.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/299858.stm | work=BBC News | title=Genocide suspect 'likely to be tried' | date=20 March 1999 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/341887.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rwanda genocide adjournment | date=12 May 1999 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref>\nHe was eventually convicted of murder of the peacekeepers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/07/05/rwanda.genocide.reut/index.html |title=Bernard Ntuyahaga indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> On December 18, 2008, the ICTR found Colonel [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]] guilty of [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]] and sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]], in part due to his involvement in the murders of Uwilingiyimana and the Belgian peacekeepers.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/world/africa/19rwanda.html?hp|title=Rwandan Officer Found Guilty of 1994 Genocide |last=Polgreen|first=Lydia|date=2008-12-18|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref><ref name=\"AP\">{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hhAjYAC6mve6OkZF9W4JEi_PSTeAD955BL081|title=Planner of Rwandan massacres convicted of genocide|last=Chhatbar|first=Sukhdev|date=2008-12-18|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Reuters\">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSLI8785620081218?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews|title=Rwanda's Bagosora sentenced to life for genocide|last=Nyakuiru|first=Frank|date=2008-12-18|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThough short, her political career was precedent-setting as one of the few female political figures in Africa.

As a memorial to the late Rwandan Prime Minister, the [[Forum for African Women Educationalists]] (FAWE) established ''The Agathe Innovative Award Competition''. The award funds educational and income generating projects aimed at improving the prospects of African girls.

Her father was a former MP, but withdrew from politics before Claudette was born. Claudette went to elementary and secondary schools run by nuns, studied diverse subjects, including medicine and pedagogy, in Spain, the US, Mexico and Haiti and she obtained a license in law and economics at the university in Port-au-Prince. In 1978 she was registered as a lawyer<ref>Skard (2014), pp. 264-5</ref> \n\n==Career==\n\nIn 1968-70 Werleigh worked as a medical technician and chemist in the US, in 1971-73 as a physiologist in Switzerland and in 1973-74 as an adult educator in Haiti. In 1970, she married George Werleigh, a professor of economics and a prominent figure in the social-democratic party PANPRA (the National Progressive Revolutional Haitian Party). The couple had two daughters.\n\nWerleigh engaged in social and educational work in a number of non governmental organizations in the fields of adult literacy and humanitarian relief. In 1975 she joined Catholic Emergency Aid for Haiti and was from 1976 to 1987 Secretary General in Haiti National Caritas, travelling all around the country. From 1983 to 1987 she was Caribbean Coordinator for Caritas International. In 1979, Werleigh founded ITECA (Institute of Technology and Animation) one of Haiti's most important educational organizations.<ref>Bijoyeta Das (2011) ''Building bridges, building peace, the life and work of Claudette Werleigh of Haiti'', University of San Diego: 2011 Women Peace Makers Programme</ref>\n\nShe helped found the League for women's empowerment (\"Lig Pouvwa Fanm\"), an organization of women seeking political and economic equality and promoting women's participation in politics. It was important to bridge the gulf separating different worlds, the poor and the affluent, women and power structures. Women were the backbone of society and had a great capacity for peace-making <ref>Skard (2014), p. 265</ref>\n\n==Political positions==\n\nFrom 1990 onwards Werleigh became active in public administration and politics in Haiti. From March to August 1990 she was Minister of Social Affairs as an independent in President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot's interim government. When Aristide became President, Werleigh joined Prime Minister Rene Preval's private cabinet in 1991 and was engaged in the Lavalas movement in support of the president. From July 1992 to October 1993, she was the executive director of the Washington office on Haiti, doing advocacy and lobbying. In 1993-95 she was Minister of Foreign Affairs and Religions in the Malval and Michel governments. She then served as Prime Minister for a hundred days in 1995-96. Her task was to strengthen the leadership of the country and organize democratic presidential elections.<ref>Das (2011); Skard (2014), pp. 264-5</ref>\n\nClaudette Werleigh appointed a cabinet with 17 ministers, including 4 women, and declared that her aim was political, social, cultural and economic justice <ref>Haiti Info (1995)\"Werleigh sworn in for 100 days\", ''Haitian Information Bureau'', 4(2), 12 November</ref> She received financial support for energy, agriculture and road construction and improved relations with Cuba and Taiwan. She also tried to reduce Haiti's economic dependence and halted the privatization process. But then IMF held back loans, sparking a political crisis. Rene Preval was elected president with 88 per cent of the vote. It was the first peaceful change of president since Haiti became independent. Preval was an ally of Aristide and would have liked Claudette Werleigh to continue as prime minister. But the majority in parliament, which needed to approve the prime minister, had changed, so Werleigh withdrew and left the country<ref>Das (2011); Skard (2014), pp. 264-6</ref>\n\n==Peaceworker==\n\nIn 1999 she became the conflict transformation programme\u2019s director of the Life and Peace Institute in Uppsala, Sweden. Claudette's work took her to conflict areas all over Latin America and several other countries in Asia, Africa, and to most countries in Western Europe.

When she took office in 1991, she was the first woman in the country's history and second in the [[List of Muslim majority countries|Muslim world]] (after [[Benazir Bhutto]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1988\u20131990) to head a democratic government as prime minister. Zia was the First Lady of Bangladesh during the presidency of her husband [[Ziaur Rahman]]. She is the chairperson and leader of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) which was founded by Rahman in the late 1970s.\n\nAfter a military coup in 1982, led by Army Chief General [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]], Zia helped lead the continuing movement for democracy until the fall of military dictator Ershad in 1990.

She was active in opposing what she and her supporters considered the military autocracy of Ershad. During the autocratic rule of [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] the Bangladesh Nationalist Party formed a seven-party alliance. Zia was detained more than seven times because of her protests against Ershad.<ref>http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/biography/khaleda.html</ref> Zia came to power three times. She was the longest serving Prime Minister of Bangladesh as she served for 10 years.\n\n==Prime Minister==\n\n===First term===\n[[File:Prinses Beatrix en mevrouw Begem Ziaur Rahman bezoeken Madurodam.jpg|left|thumb|Zia in 1979]]\nA neutral caretaker government in Bangladesh oversaw elections on 27 February 1991 that were broadly considered to be free, fair and truly democratic, following eight years of a military government.\n\nThe BNP won 140 seats, 11 short of a majority. As it was the only party capable of forming a government, Zia was sworn in as the country's first female prime minister on 20 March with the support of a majority of the deputies in parliament.\n\nThe acting president [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]] granted Zia nearly all of the powers that were vested in the president at the time, effectively returning Bangladesh to a parliamentary system in September 1991. With a unanimous vote, Parliament passed the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|12th amendment]] to the Constitution in 1991. The BNP-led government formally restored the parliamentary system.\n\n===Second term===\nWhen the opposition boycotted the 15 February 1996 election, the BNP had a landslide victory in the sixth [[Jatiya Sangshad]]. Other major parties demanded that a neutral [[caretaker government]] be appointed to oversee the elections. The short-lived [[Parliament of Bangladesh|parliament]] hastily introduced the [[Caretaker Government]] by passing the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|13th amendment]] to the Constitution. The parliament was dissolved to pave the way for parliamentary elections within 90 days.\n\nIn the 12 June 1996 elections, BNP lost to Sheikh Hasina's [[Awami League]]. Winning 116 seats, the BNP emerged as the largest opposition party in the country's parliamentary history.\n\n===Third term===\n[[File:Mr and Mrs Zia 1979.jpg|thumb|Zia with husband [[Ziaur Rahman]] in 1979]]\nThe BNP formed a four-party alliance<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1578373.stm |title=Analysis: Challenges ahead for Bangladesh |date=4 October 2001 |publisher=BBC News |author=Alastair Lawson}}</ref> on 6 January 1999 to increase its chances to return to power in the next general elections.

The four-party alliance participated in the 1 October 2001 general elections, winning two-thirds of the seats in parliament and 46% of the vote (compared to the principal opposition party's 40%). Zia was sworn in as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.\n\nShe worked on a 100-day program to fulfill most of her election pledges to the nation. During this term, the share of domestic resources in economic development efforts grew. Bangladesh began to attract a higher level of international investment for development of the country's infrastructure, energy resources and businesses, including from the United States, Great Britain, and Japan. Restoration of law and order was an achievement during the period.\n\nZia promoted neighborly relations in her foreign policy. In her \"look-east policy,\" she worked to bolster regional cooperation in South Asia and adherence to the UN Charter of Human Rights. She negotiated settlement of international disputes, and renounced the use of force in international relations. Bangladesh began to participate in United Nations international peacekeeping efforts. In 2006, ''Forbes'' magazine featured her administration in a major story praising her achievements. Her government worked to educate young girls (nearly 70% of Bangladeshi women were illiterate) and distribute food to the poor (half of Bangladesh's 135 million people live below the poverty line). Her government promoted strong GDP growth (5%) based on economic reforms and support of an entrepreneurial culture.\n\nWhen Zia became Prime Minister for the third time, the GDP growth rate of Bangladesh remained above 6 percent. The Bangladesh per capita national income rose to 482 dollars. Foreign exchange reserve of Bangladesh had crossed 3 billion dollars from the previous 1 billion dollars. The foreign direct investments of Bangladesh had risen to 2.5 billion dollars. The industrial sector of the GDP had exceeded 17 percent at the end of Zia's office.<ref name=\"banglapedia.org\" />\n\n===End of term===\nOn 29 October 2006, Zia's term in office ended. In accordance with the constitution, a caretaker government would manage in the 90-day interim before general elections. On the eve of the last day, rioting broke out on the streets of central [[Dhaka]] due to uncertainty over who would become Chief Advisor (head of the [[Caretaker Government of Bangladesh]]).
