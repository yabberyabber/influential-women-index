Though her work is not directly about issues resulting from climate change or ecological disaster, her paintings reference a significant shift in our thinking and our planet.\n\nLisa Adams' work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and is represented by CB1 Gallery<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cb1gallery.com/artists/lisa-adams.html |title=CB1 Gallery Artist - Lisa Adams |publisher=Cb1gallery.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref> in Los Angeles, where her 2013 solo exhibition ''Second Life'' was reviewed in the ''LA Times'' by Holly Myers.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-art-review-lisa-adams-at-cb1-gallery-20130409,0,7547297.story |title=Review: Lisa Adams' 'Second Life' sets off on an engaging journey - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2013-04-12 |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref> Her most recent exhibition ''America The Beautiful'' ran from September 12 - October 31, 2015 and her upcoming exhibition at CB1 Gallery is slated for January, 2016.\n\nLisa also blogs on Los Angeles art for the [[Huffington Post]].\n\n==Early influences and work==\nAdams knew she would be an artist at age ten after seeing a reproduction of [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'s ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]''. She also recalls being fascinated by the [[Charles and Ray Eames]] short film ''[[Powers of Ten (film)|Powers of Ten]]'' and by a [[Karl Benjamin]] non-objective painting when she was thirteen years old.\n\nIn 1981, shortly after graduating from the [[Claremont Graduate University]], Adams and artist [[Craig Kauffman]] (with whom she was romantically involved at the time) moved to [[SoHo, New York|SoHo]] in New York City. She often referred to that time as her ''real'' education, where she was influenced by artists such as [[Susan Rothenberg]] and [[Julian Schnabel]]. Adams' work was included in group exhibitions in the East Village and SoHo.\n\nIn 1985 after her split with Kauffman, she returned to Los Angeles and continued to pursue her career as a painter. Adams painted abstractly for over a decade, eventually experimenting with unconventional art materials, such as linoleum and caulking and she learned how to weld and woodwork, incorporating steel and shaped panels as elements integral to her paintings. She thought of her investigations into this hybrid form of artwork as \u201cwall dependent\u201d sculpture. Later in the early 2000s Adams received a Durfee ARC Grant<ref>{{cite web|url=http://durfee.org/ |title=The Durfee Foundation |publisher=Durfee.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref> to purse experiments in video work.\n\n==Public art, residencies and special projects==\nIn addition to her studio practice Adams works on public art projects which have included the West Valley Branch Library, Reseda, California, the Fire Station No. 64<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.box.net/shared/494mer31al |title=Simple Online Collaboration: Online File Storage, FTP Replacement, Team Workspaces |publisher=Box |date= |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref> in Watts, Los Angeles and her most recent public art project is the Chatsworth Station<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesource.metro.net/2012/02/03/art-for-the-orange-line-a-glimpse-of-stoney-point-park-by-lisa-adams/ |title=Art for the Orange Line: A glimpse of Stoney Point Park by Lisa Adams &#124; Metro's The Source |publisher=Thesource.metro.net |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref> for the Los Angeles Metro Orange Line Extension completed in June 2012.\n\nAs an artist-in-residence, Adams has lived and worked in Slovenia, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands and Costa Rica and has traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nShe has worked as an independent curator, who in 2000, co-founded Crazy Space, an [[alternative exhibition space]], in Santa Monica, California.\n\nIn the 1990s Adams was commission by [[BMW]] of North America to paint an ArtCar<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.box.net/shared/0sfv884enu |title=Simple Online Collaboration: Online File Storage, FTP Replacement, Team Workspaces |publisher=Box |date= |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref> and has been included in ''A Day in the Life of the American Woman: How We See Ourselves'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Day-Life-American-Woman-Ourselves/dp/0821257064 |title=A Day in the Life of the American Woman:  How We See Ourselves: Sharon J.

In 1971, Akerman's first film ''Saute ma ville'' premiered at the Oberhausen short-film festival.<ref>{{cite book |last=Margulies |first=Ivone |date=1996 |title=Nothing Happens: Chantal Akerman's hyperrealist everyday |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |page=2 |isbn=0-8223-1723-0}}</ref> That year, she moved to [[New York City]], where she remained until 1972.\n\nAt [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York, Akerman was impressed with the work of [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Michael Snow]], [[Yvonne Rainer]] and [[Andy Warhol]]. She stated that Snow's ''[[La R\u00e9gion Centrale]]'' introduced her to the relations among film, time and energy. {{citation needed|reason=relevance?|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Critical recognition===\nHer feature ''Hotel Monterey'' (1972) and shorts ''La Chambre 1'' and ''La Chambre 2'' reveal the influence of structural filmmaking through these films' usage of long takes. These protracted shots serve to oscillate images between abstraction and figuration. Akerman's films from this period also signify the start of her collaboration with cinematographer [[Babette Mangolte]], the director of photography on ''La chambre'' (1972), ''H\u00f4tel Monterey'' (1972), ''Hanging Out Yonkers'' (1973), ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'' (1975) and ''News from Home'' (1977). In 1973, Akerman returned to Belgium and in 1974 received critical recognition for her feature ''[[I, You, He, She]]''.\n\nAkerman's most significant film, ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'' was released in 1975. Often considered one of the great feminist films, the film makes a hypnotic, real-time study of a middle-aged widow\u2019s stifling routine of domestic chores and prostitution. Upon the film's release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called ''Jeanne Dielman'' the \"first masterpiece of the feminine in the history of the cinema\". Chantal Akerman scholar Ivone Margulies says the picture is a filmic paradigm for uniting feminism and anti-illusionism.<ref name=\"criterion\"/> The film was named the 19th-greatest film of the 20th century by [[J. Hoberman]] of the ''[[Village Voice]]''.<ref>Hoberman, J. (2001) [4 January 2000]. \"100 Best Films of the 20th Century: Village Voice Critics' Poll\". The Village Voice (reprint ed.).

They are best known for their extensive series of photographic images, or [[Typology (urban planning and architecture)|typologies]], of industrial buildings and structures, often organised in grids. As the founders of what has come to be known as the \u2018Becher school\u2019 or the \u2018D\u00fcsseldorf School\u2019 they influenced generations of documentary photographers and artists.<ref>https://www.artsy.net/gene/dusseldorf-school-of-photography</ref> They have been awarded the [[Erasmus Prize]] and the [[Hasselblad Award]].\n\n== Biography ==\nBernd Becher was born in [[Siegen]].  He studied painting at the Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste Stuttgart from 1953 to 1956, then [[typography]] under Karl R\u00f6ssing at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] from 1959 to 1961. Hilla Becher was born in [[Potsdam]]. Prior to Hilla's time studying [[photography]] at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf from 1958 to 1961, she had completed an apprenticeship as a photographer in her native Potsdam. Both began working as freelance photographers for the Troost Advertising Agency in D\u00fcsseldorf, concentrating on product photography.\n\nThe couple married in 1961.\n\n== Work ==\nMeeting as students at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf in 1957, Bernd and Hilla Becher first collaborated on photographing and documenting the disappearing German [[industrial architecture]] in 1959. The [[Ruhr|Ruhr Valley]], where Becher\u2019s family had worked in the steel and mining industries, was their initial focus. They were fascinated by the similar shapes in which certain buildings were designed. After collating thousands of pictures of individual structures, they noticed that the various edifices \u2013 of cooling towers, gas tanks and coal bunkers, for instance \u2013 shared many distinctive formal qualities. In addition, they were intrigued by the fact that so many of these industrial buildings seemed to have been built with a great deal of attention toward design.\n\nTogether, the Bechers went out with a large 8 x 10-inch view camera and photographed these buildings from a number of different angles, but always with a straightforward \"objective\" point of view. They shot only on overcast days, so as to avoid shadows, and early in the morning during the seasons of spring and fall. Objects included barns, water towers, coal tipples, cooling towers, grain elevators, coal bunkers, coke ovens, oil refineries, blast furnaces, gas tanks, storage silos, and warehouses. At each site the Bechers also created overall landscape views of the entire plant, which set the structures in their context and show how they relate to each other.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/95 Bernd and Hilla Becher: Landscape/Typology, May 21 \u2013 August 25, 2008] Museum of Modern Art, New York.</ref> They excluded any details that would detract from the central theme and instead set up comparisons of viewpoint and lighting through which the eye is led to the basic structural pattern of the images being compared.<ref name=\"Bernd and Hilla Becher\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=8095 Bernd and Hilla Becher] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.</ref> This principle, which is allied to the philosophy underlying the [[New Topographics]] movement, is most obvious in the two published series, \n''Anonyme Skulpturen: Eine Typologie technischer Bauten'' and ''Typologien, Industrieller Bau, 1963\u20131975'', in which the images are contrasted in groups of three.<ref name=\"Bernd and Hilla Becher\"/> Another early project, which they pursued for nearly two decades, was published as ''Framework Houses'' (Schirmer/Mosel) in 1977, a visual catalog of types of structures, an approach that characterized much of their work.<ref>Philip Gefter (June 26, 2007), [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/arts/26becher.html Bernd Becher, 75, Photographer of German Industrial Landscape, Dies] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\nIn drawing attention to the cultural dimension of industrial architecture, their work also highlighted the need for preservation of these buildings. On the couple's initiative the [[Zollern II/IV Colliery]] at [[Dortmund|Dortmund-Bovinghausen]] in the Ruhr, for the most part an [[art-deco]] structure, was designated a protected landmark.\n\nThe Bechers also photographed outside Germany, including from 1965 buildings in Great Britain, France, Belgium and later in the United States. In 1966, they undertook a six-month journey through England and south Wales, taking hundreds of photographs of the coal industry around Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Nottingham and the Rhondda Valley.<ref>Gabriele Conrath-Scholl and Susanne Lange (20 July 2007), [http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2007/jul/20/guardianobituaries.germany Obituary: Bernd Becher] ''The Guardian''.</ref> In 1974, they traveled to North America for the first time, touring sites in New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and southern Ontario, depicting a range of industrial structures, from coal breakers to wooden winding towers.<ref>[http://www.lacma.org/art/nt-becher.aspx New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape, October 25, 2009 \u2013 January 3, 2010] [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].</ref>\n\nThe Bechers exhibited and published their single-image [[gelatin silver print]]s, grouped by subject, in a grid of six, nine, or fifteen. By the mid-1960s the Bechers had settled on a preferred presentational mode: the images of structures with similar functions are then displayed side by side to invite viewers to compare their forms and designs based on function, regional idiosyncrasies, or the age of the structures. The Bechers used the term \u201ctypology\u201d to describe these ordered sets of photographs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bernd Becher |work=The Times |date=July 3, 2007 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2015817.ece}} Subscription required for online access.</ref> The works\u2019 titles are pithy and captions note only time and location.<ref>[Bernd & Hilla Becher: ''Six Spherical Gasholders'', 1972\u20131996] Christie\u2019s, 5 May 2006, New York, Rockefeller Plaza.</ref> In 1989\u201391, for an exhibition at the [[Dia Art Foundation]] in New York, the Bechers introduced a second format into their oeuvre: single images that are larger in size \u2014 twenty-four by twenty inches \u2014 and presented individually, rather than as gridded tableaux.<ref>[http://www.diacenter.org/exhibitions/introduction/76 Bernd and Hilla Becher] Dia Art Foundation, New York.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Bernd Becher started teaching photography at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf (policy matters prevented Hilla's simultaneous appointment), where he remained on the faculty until 1996. Before him, photography had been excluded from what was largely a school for painters. He influenced students that later made a name for themselves in the photography world. Former students of Bernd's included [[Andreas Gursky]], [[Thomas Ruff]], [[Thomas Struth]], [[Candida H\u00f6fer]], and [[Elger Esser]]. Bernd died in [[Rostock]].\n\nAfter Bernd Becher's death, his widow Hilla continued to reassemble their works, mostly using existing photographs.<ref>Melanie Gerlis (June 11, 2013), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Spr%C3%BCth+takes+on+Bernd+and+Hilla+Becher/29880 Spr\u00fcth takes on Bernd and Hilla Becher] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref>\n\n===Influence===\nThe Becher school has influenced a number of (mainly) German photographers including [[Laurenz Berges]], Andreas Gursky, Candida H\u00f6fer, [[Axel H\u00fctte]], Simone Nieweg, Thomas Ruff, Thomas Struth and Petra Wunderlich.<ref>Gabriele Conrath-Scholl and Susanne Lange, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2007/jul/20/guardianobituaries.germany \"Obituary: Bernd Becher, Photographer who documented industrial architecture with style and precision\"], ''The Guardian''</ref> The Canadian [[Edward Burtynsky]] also works in a similar mode.

Their work became better known in the United States with the publication of their book ''Anonyme Skulpturen'' (Anonymous Sculptures) in 1970. The Bechers were shown at the [[George Eastman House]] and in solo exhibitions at [[Sonnabend Gallery]], New York, in 1972. In 1974, the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], London, organized an exhibition of their work, which toured the United Kingdom. The couple was invited to participate in [[Documenta]] 5, 6, 7, and 11 in Kassel in 1972, 1977, 1982 and 2002, and at the [[Bienal de S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1977. The [[Van Abbemuseum|Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum]], Eindhoven, organized a retrospective of the artists\u2019 work in 1981. In 1985 the artists had a major museum exhibition, which traveled to the [[Museum Folkwang]], Essen, [[Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne de la Ville de Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. In 1991 the artists won the Leone d\u2019Oro award for sculpture at the [[Venice Biennale]]. The Venice installation was reworked later in 1991, in a retrospective exhibition at the [[K\u00f6lnischer Kunstverein]], Cologne. The Typologies installation was exhibited in 1994 at the [[Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation]], Toronto, and at the [[Westphalian State Museum of Art and Cultural History|Westf\u00e4lisches Landesmuseum f\u00fcr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte]] in M\u00fcnster. Other retrospectives of the couple\u2019s work have been organized by the Photographische Sammlung/SK Stiftung Kulture in Cologne (1999 and 2003), [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris (2005) and [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York (2008).<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Bernd%20and%20Hilla%20Becher Bernd and Hilla Becher] Guggenheim Collection.</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Hilla Becher curated \"August Sander/Bernd and Hilla Becher: \u2018A Dialogue\u2019\" at Bruce Silverstein Gallery in New York.

Berlin recalled, \"My mother wanted me to be a slim, respectable socialite.

They married in 1960 and later divorced. As Andy Warhol observed in his book ''Popism'': \"When Brigid brought her window dresser fianc\u00e9 home to meet the family, her mother told the doorman to tell him to wait on a bench across the street in Central Park. Then she handed Brigid her wedding present \u2013 a hundred dollar bill \u2013 and told her to go to Bergdorf's and buy herself some new underwear with it.

These injections were readily available through the many 'Doctor Feelgoods' in New York and perfectly legal.\n\nBerlin appeared in several of Warhol's films, including ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966), in which she is seen injecting herself while performing a monologue, and ''[[Ciao! Manhattan]]'' (1972), which starred [[Edie Sedgwick]]. Decades later, she appeared in minor parts in two [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' films, ''[[Serial Mom]]'' (1994) and ''[[Pecker (film)|Pecker]]'' (1998). ''Pie in the Sky: The Brigid Berlin Story'' (2000) is a documentary in which she tells her life story in intimate detail and breaks her diet by consuming an entire meal of [[key lime pie]]s.\n\nShe was known for her obsessive taping and photographing of everyday life. Selections from these tapes were later compiled by [[Anthony Ingrassia]] to form the play ''Andy Warhol's Pork''. Other tapes made by her were the basis for [[The Velvet Underground]]'s first live album, ''[[Live at Max's Kansas City]]'' (recorded 1970, released 1972).\n\nBerlin was complicit in one of Warhol's most infamous pranks when, in 1969, Warhol announced that all of his paintings were the work of Berlin. Brigid enthusiastically followed this line when interviewed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. The prank led to a drop in the value of Warhol's work and both parties eventually retracted their statements. The question of [[authorship]] looms large in valuing Warhol's paintings to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pasunautre.com/this-and-that-main/2015/10/21/a-beautiful-bouquet-of-rebelliousness-ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-artist-and-former-andy-warhol-superstar-brigid-berlin|title=A Beautiful Bouquet of Rebelliousness: Ten Things You Need To Know About Artist and Former Andy Warhol Superstar Brigid Berlin|website=Autre Magazine|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Brigid Berlin began work as a permanent employee for Andy Warhol's ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, a position that she held until well after Warhol's death. Berlin would transcribe interviews and knit and needlepoint under the desk. [[Patricia Hearst]] (a close friend of Berlin's who began work at ''Interview'' in 1988) would observe ''\"On my first day at work, I noticed two small pugs who seemed to have the run of the castle. They belonged to a woman who sat behind the front desk every day from 9:00 to 5:00, but who never seemed to answer the phone. Instead, she compulsively knitted, ate bags of candy and tended lovingly to the dogs.\"''\n\n==Artwork==\n{{unsourced|section|date=August 2015}}\nBrigid Berlin is also famous for her prolific art, which has been argued by many to have been both influential to Andy Warhol's artwork and simultaneously overshadowed by Warhol's celebrity and own artwork. Berlin's \"Tit Prints\" were artworks created using her bare breasts. Berlin would dip her breasts into multiple colored paints and then create a print by pressing them down onto canvas/paper. The Tit Prints are arguably Berlin's most infamous work and were exhibited by Jane Stubbs at a gallery on Madison Avenue in 1996. On occasion, Berlin would publicly create Tit Prints, integrating visual art and performance art that \"is totally not about nudity, this is about, you know, art.\" She performed this act live at the Gramercy International Art Fair. After experiencing the performance, filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] later commented, \"I think that she's the most unselfconscious nude person... [She has] great confidence for a fat girl.\"\n\nBerlin also compiled and maintained scrapbooks that she referred to as \"trip books.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artforum.com/words/id=41115|title=Brigid Berlin discusses life and art|last=Jovanovich|first=As told to Alex|website=artforum.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> Volumes of these scrapbooks collecting cartoons and sketches of male genitalia were known as \"The Cock Book\" and included the genitalia of artists such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Warhol.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4724316/One-is-never-enough.html|title=One is never enough|last=Garnett|first=By Daisy|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> Three volumes of \"The Cock Book\" sold for $175,000 at auction to artist Richard Prince.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/richard-prince/#_|title=Richard Prince|website=Interview Magazine|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/the-way-they-live/2008/brigid-berlin|title=Brigid Berlin|website=New York Social Diary|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref>\n\nBoth Berlin and Warhol used the medium of [[Instant film|Polaroid]] photography obsessively, and are said to have been very competitive in the Polaroid film department, whether over the best equipment or the best film. In 1969\u20131970 German art dealer [[Heiner Friedrich]] did a small showing of Berlin's work called ''Polaroids and Tapes'' and created a catalogue for the work of the same name.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://cornell.worldcat.org/title/polaroids-and-tapes/oclc/49290760&referer=brief_results|title=Polaroids and tapes|last=Berlin|first=Brigid|last2=Waldman|first2=Anne|last3=Polk|first3=Brigid|date=1971-01-01|publisher=Heiner Friedrich|location=K\u00f6ln|language=English}}</ref> The experimental nature of Berlin's double-exposed Polaroids transcend the static, emotionless \"icon\" Polaroids of Warhol's, clearly showing the power of her personal vision and photographic style.

Born in London, she suffered [[scarlet fever]] as a child, spending weekends and holidays at her grandparents' fruit farm. There she spent time painting, before enrolling at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in 1941. In 1947, she travelled to Italy to study art, enrolling in [[Accademia di Belle Arti]], where she met [[Alberto Burri]], her partner for a few years. \n\nBlow and Burri travelled Italy before working together in Paris, and Burri was a significant influence on Blow, teaching her to work in different materials and inspiring a passion for art.\n\n==Early life==\nSandra Betty Blow was born on 14 September 1925 in Newington, London. She came from a Jewish family; her father, Jacob, who was a fruit wholesaler, and her mother had three children, Sandra was the second. During her childhood, Blow spent weekends and holidays in Kent at her grandparents' fruit farm.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite ODNB|id=97353|title=Blow, Sandra Betty (1925\u20132006), painter and collagist|last=Gooding|first=Mel|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, Blow suffered with [[scarlet fever]], followed by [[rheumatic fever]], from which her heart never fully recovered. After attending a local primary school, Blow was educated at a private girls school. At the age of fourteen, Blow was evacuated with her mother and two brothers to [[Paddock Wood]] in Kent, near her grandparents' fruit farm, where she spent her time reading, drawing and painting.<ref group=Note>A precautionary safety measure.  Britain declared war on Germany 3 September 1939.{{cite ODNB|id=97353|title=Sir Neville Bowles Chamberlain|last=Crozier|first=Andrew J.|year=2013}}</ref><ref name=ODNB />\n\nBlow enrolled at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in 1941, where she studied until 1946 under teachers including [[Ruskin Spear]]. During this time she joined the artists' social scene, meeting people such as [[Lucian Freud]], [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]] and [[Francis Bacon]]. She spent a short period in 1947 at the [[Royal Academy schools]], but found the teaching dull, so instead travelled to Italy to study classic art. There she was inspired by [[Nicolas Carone]] to enrol at [[Accademia di Belle Arti]] in Rome. There she met [[Alberto Burri]], with whom she began a relationship and travelled Italy during 1948.<ref name=ODNB />\n\nBlow and Burri worked together in Paris during 1949, but the spark had left their relationship so they split on friendly terms, with the pair creating works in response to the other throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Blow returned to London in 1950, where she produced works regularly. In 1960, she started teaching painting at [[Royal College of Art]], where she remained until 1975, whilst also painting in her studio in [[Chelsea, London]]. She was elected to the [[Royal Academy]] in 1978.<ref name=ODNB />\n\n==Artwork==\n[[Image:Blow, Space and Matter.jpg|thumb|200px|''Space and Matter'', 1959, [[Tate Gallery]]]]\nAfter her structured training at Saint Martin's, Blow was influenced by Nicolas Carone and his approach to colour and space. He in turn had been influenced by [[Hans Hofmann]]. Blow was also influenced by Alberto Burri, who was progressing towards abstract [[art informel]], using materials such as sacking. Blow and Burri started a relationship, and travelled together throughout Italy during 1948, influencing each other's styles. It was through him that she started to use \"poor\" non-art materials, but his lasting influence was in his commitment to art and his interest in the different textures of the world.<ref name=ODNB />\n\nBlow's work in the abstract art is considered pioneering,<ref>{{cite web|title=A look inside the studio of Sandra Blow RA {{!}} Blog {{!}} Royal Academy of Arts|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/a-look-inside-the-studio-of-sandra|website=www.royalacademy.org.uk|publisher=Royal Academy|accessdate=13 August 2016}}</ref> she would regularly use [[collage]] effects in her paintings and sometimes dyed her canvas with tea to produce different effects.

Her mother's death inspired her to abandon mathematics and to begin studying art. Her father thought modern artists were wastrels and refused to support her. She continued to study art by joining classes where translators were needed for English-speaking students, in which those translators were not charged tuition. In one such class [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]] saw her work and told her she was a sculptor, not a painter.<ref name=\"Louise Bourgeois obituary\"/>\n\nBourgeois graduated from the Sorbonne in 1935, and continued to study art at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]], where she studied from 1937 to 1938 and at various other art schools, such as the [[\u00c9cole du Louvre]] and the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]]. During the time in which she was enrolled at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, she turned to her father's infidelities for inspiration. She discovered her creative impulse in her childhood traumas and tensions.<ref name=\"legs\"/>\n\nBourgeois had a desire for first-hand experience, and frequently visited studios in Paris, learning techniques from the artists and assisting with exhibitions.<ref name=\"Cybermuse\"/>\n\nBourgeois briefly opened a print store beside her father's tapestry workshop.

However, in 1940, she gave birth to another son, Jean-Louis, and in 1941, she gave birth to Alain.<ref name=\"Louise Bourgeois obituary\"/>\n\n===Middle years===\n<!-- Between 1946 and 1967, please do not rename section. -->\nFor Bourgeois the early 1940s represented the difficulties of a transition to a new country and the struggle to enter the exhibition world of New York City.  Her work during this time was constructed from junkyard scraps and driftwood which she used to carve upright wood sculptures.  The impurities of the wood were then camouflaged with paint, after which nails were employed to invent holes and scratches in the endeavor to portray some emotion. The ''Sleeping Figure'' is one such example which depicts a war figure that is unable to face the real world due to vulnerability. Throughout her life, Bourgeois' work was created from revisiting of her own troubled past as she found inspiration and temporary catharsis from her childhood years and the abuse she suffered from her father.  Slowly she developed more artistic confidence, although her middle years are more opaque, which might be due to the fact that she received very little attention from the art world despite having her first solo show in 1945.<ref name=\"fiches.lexpress.fr\">http://fiches.lexpress.fr/personnalite/louise-bourgeois_268971/biographie</ref><br>\n<br>In 1954, Bourgeois joined the [[American Abstract Artists|American Abstract Artists Group]], with several contemporaries, among them [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]].  At this time she also befriended the artists [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Mark Rothko]], and [[Jackson Pollock]].<ref name=\"Cybermuse\">{{cite web\n   | url = http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/docs/bio_artistid640_e.jsp\n   | title = Biography{{spaced ndash}}Louise Bourgeois\n   | work = Cybermuse\n   | accessdate  = 12 June 2010}}</ref>\nAs part of the American Abstract Artists Group, Bourgeois made the transition from wood and upright structures to marble, plaster and bronze as she investigated concerns like fear, vulnerability and loss of control.  This transition was a turning point. She referred to her art as a series or sequence closely related to days and circumstances, describing her early work as the fear of falling which later transformed into the art of falling and the final evolution as the art of hanging in there.  Her conflicts in real life empowered her to authenticate her experiences and struggles through a unique art form. In 1958, Bourgeois and her husband moved into a [[terraced house]] at [[22nd Street (Manhattan)#20th to 22nd Streets|West 22nd Street]], in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]], where she lived and worked for the rest of her life.<ref name=\"Louise Bourgeois obituary\"/>\n\nDespite the fact that she rejected the idea that her art was feminist, Borgeois\u2019 subject was the feminine. Works such as Femme Maison (1946-1947), Torso self-portrait (1963-1964), Arch of Hysteria (1993),  all depict the feminine body. Sexually explicit sculptures such as Janus Fleuri, (1968) show she was not afraid to use the female form in new ways.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Larratt-Smith|first1=Phillip|title=Louise Bourgeois: The Return of the Repressed|journal=Art Tattler|date=March 19 {{ndash}} June 19, 2011|url=http://arttattler.com/archivebourgeois.html}}</ref> She has been quoted to say \u201cMy work deals with problems that are pre-gender,\" she wrote. \"For example, jealousy is not male or female.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Louise Bourgeois Passes Away {{ndash}} RIP|journal=Pop Cultured|date=May 31, 2010|url=http://popcultured.livejournal.com/60251.html?thread=1786971|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Later life ===\n<!-- Between 1967 and 2010, please do not rename section. -->\nIn 1973, Bourgeois started teaching at the [[Pratt Institute]], [[Cooper Union]], [[Brooklyn College]] and the [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]]. She also taught for many years in the public schools in Great Neck, Long Island.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Bourgeois would hold gatherings called \u201cSunday, bloody Sundays\u201d at her home in Chelsea. These salons would be filled with young artists and students whose work would be critiqued by Bourgeois. Bourgeois ruthlessness in critique and her dry sense of humor lead to the naming of these meetings.

In an interview with ''[[Artforum]]'', timed to coincide with the opening of her retrospective, she revealed that the imagery in her sculptures was wholly autobiographical.

Many are small enclosures into which the viewer is prompted to peer inward at arrangements of symbolic objects; others are small rooms into which the viewer is invited to enter. In the cell pieces, Bourgeois uses earlier sculptural forms, found objects as well as personal items that carried strong personal emotional charge for the artist.\n\nThe cells enclose psychological and intellectual states, primarily feelings of fear and pain. Bourgeois stated that the Cells represent \u201cdifferent types of pain; physical, emotional and psychological, mental and intellectual\u2026 Each Cell deals with a fear. Fear is pain\u2026 Each Cell deals with the pleasure of the voyeur, the thrill of looking and being looked at.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources//ENS-bourgeois-EN//ENS-bourgeois-EN.html|title=Centre Pompidou Louise Bourgeois Exhibition Itinerary|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''Maman''===\n{{Main article|Maman (sculpture)}}\n<!-- Please do no alternate or add any extensive information to this section, instead, please consider adding information to the subjects main article. -->\n[[File:Maman de Louise Bourgeois - Bilbao.jpg|thumb|Bourgeois' ''Maman'' sculpture at the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim Museum]] in [[Bilbao]]]]\nIn the late 1990s, Bourgeois began using the spider as a central image in her art.

So, spiders are helpful and protective, just like my mother.|Louise Bourgeois<ref name=\"tate '08\"/>}}\n\n===Printmaking===\nBourgeois\u2019s [[printmaking]] flourished during the early and late phases of her career: in the 1930s and 1940s, when she first came to New York from Paris, and then again starting in the 1980s, when her work began to receive wide recognition. Early on, she made prints at home on a small press, or at the renowned workshop [[Stanley William Hayter|Atelier 17]]. That period was followed by a long hiatus, as Bourgeois turned her attention fully to sculpture. It was not until she was in her seventies that she began to make prints again, encouraged first by print publishers. She set up her old press, and added a second, while also working closely with printers who came to her house to collaborate. A very active phase of printmaking followed, lasting until the artist\u2019s death. Over the course of her life, Bourgeois created approximately 1,500 printed compositions.\n\nIn 1990, Bourgeois decided to donate the complete archive of her printed work to [[The Museum of Modern Art]]. In 2013, The Museum launched the online [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]], [http://www.moma.org/explore/collection/lb/index \"Louise Bourgeois: The Complete Prints & Books.\"] The site focuses on the artist\u2019s creative process and places Bourgeois\u2019s prints and illustrated books within the context of her overall production by including related works in other mediums that deal with the same themes and imagery.\n\n===Pervasive themes===\n\nOne theme of Bourgeois's work is that of childhood trauma and hidden emotion. After Louise's mother became sick with influenza Louise's father began having affairs with other women, most notably with Sadie, Louise's English tutor. Louise was extremely watchful and aware of the situation.  This was the beginning of the artist's engagement with double standards related to gender and sexuality, which was expressed in much of her work. She recalls her father saying \"I love you\" repeatedly to her mother, despite infidelity. \"He was the wolf, and she was the rational hare, forgiving and accepting him as he was.\"<ref name=\"test\">[http://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag01/janfeb01/bourg/bourg.shtm], additional text.</ref> Her 1993 work \"Cell: You Better Grow Up\", part of her \"Cell\" series, speaks directly to Louise's childhood trauma and the insecurity that surrounded her. 2002's \"Give or Take\" is defined by hidden emotion, representing the intense dilemma that people face throughout their lives as they attempt to balance the actions of giving and taking. This dilemma is not only represented by the shape of the sculpture, but also the heaviness of the material this piece is made of.\n\nArchitecture and memory are important components of Bourgeois' work.  In numerous interviews, Louise describes architecture as a visual expression of memory, or memory as a type of architecture.  The memory which is featured in much of her work is an invented memory - about the death or exorcism of her father.  The imagined memory is interwoven with her real memories including living across from a slaughterhouse and her father's affair. To Louise her father represented injury and war, aggrandizement of himself and belittlement of others and most importantly a man who represented betrayal.<ref name=\"test\" /> Her 1993 work \"Cell (Three White Marble Spheres)\" speaks to fear and captivity. The mirrors within the present an altered and distorted reality.\n\nSexuality is undoubtedly one of the most important themes in the work of Louise Bourgeois. The link between sexuality and fragility or insecurity is also powerful. It has been argued that this stems from her childhood memories and her father's affairs. 1952's \"Spiral Woman\" combines Louise's focus on female sexuality and torture. The flexing leg and arm muscles indicate that the Spiral Woman is still above though she is being suffocated and hung. 1995's \"In and Out\" uses cold metal materials to link sexuality with anger and perhaps even captivity.\n\n==Selected works==\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n*'''1982'''{{spaced ndash}}{{Cite book\n  | title = Louise Bourgeois\n  | publisher = The Museum of Modern Art\n  | page = 123\n  | isbn = 0-87070-257-2}}\n*'''1994'''{{spaced ndash}}{{Cite book\n  | title = The Prints of Louise Bourgeois\n  | publisher = The Museum of Modern Art\n  | page = 254\n  | isbn = 0-8109-6141-5}}\n*'''1994'''{{spaced ndash}}{{Cite book\n  | title = Louise Bourgeois: The Locus of Memory Works 1982-1993\n  | publisher = Harry N.

Her work frequently depicts human vulnerability, and examines identity and intimacy. She is recognized for her detective-like ability to follow strangers and investigate their private lives. Her photographic work often includes panels of text of her own writing.\n\nSince 2005 Sophie Calle has taught as a professor of film and photography at [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]], Switzerland.<ref name=\"callehistory\" /> She has lectured at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in the Visual Arts Department.<ref>[http://va-grad.ucsd.edu/~drupal/node/736 Sophie Calle. 2009 Russel Lecture.] [University of California, San Diego].

Questionnaire.] Frieze Magazine. June\u2013August 2009</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== 1979\u20131981 ===\nAfter completing her schooling she travelled for seven years. When she returned to Paris in 1979 she began a series of projects to acquaint herself again both with the city and people of Paris and with herself. However, she soon discovered that observing the behaviour and actions of these strangers provided information with which to construct their identities. These sought to construct identities by offering documentary \u2018proof' in the form of photographs. Her work was seen to have roots in the tradition of conceptual art because the emphasis was on the artistic idea rather than the finished object. The French writer [[Jean Baudrillard]] wrote an essay (1988) that described this project in terms of a reciprocal loss of will on the part of both pursued and pursuer.<ref>Copyright material reproduced courtesy of Oxford University Press, New York, Grove Art Online www.groveart.com</ref>\n\nIn ''Suite Venitienne'' (1979), Calle followed a man she met at a party in Paris to [[Venice]], where she disguised herself and followed him around the city, photographing him. Calle\u2019s [[surveillance]] of the man, who she identifies only as Henri B.,  includes black and white photographs accompanied by text.<ref>Bois, Yve-Alain, \"Character Study: Sophie Calle.\" ''Artforum'', April, 2000, pp. 126\u201331.</ref>\n\nCalle's first artistic work was ''The Sleepers ''(''Les Dormeurs''), a project in which she invited passers-by to occupy her bed.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Sophie Calle, M'as-tu vue|last = |first = |publisher = Prestel Publishing|year = 2003|isbn = 3-7913-3035-7|location = Munich|pages = 15}}</ref> Some were friends, or friends of friends, and some were strangers to her. She served them food and photographed them every hour.\n\nAnother project, entitled ''The Shadow'' (1981) and displayed in the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, consisted of Calle being followed for a day by a private detective, who had been hired (at Calle's request) by her mother. It was, in Calle's words, an attempt 'to provide photographic evidence of my own existence'.  Calle proceeded to lead the unwitting detective around parts of Paris that were particularly important for her, thereby reversing the expected position of the observed subject. Aware of her follower, she also wrote about her experience in frequent journal entries throughout the day. Such projects, with their suggestions of intimacy, also questioned the role of the spectator, with viewers often feeling a sense of unease as they became the unwitting collaborators in these violations of privacy. Moreover, the deliberately constructed and thus in one sense artificial nature of the documentary \u2018evidence' used in Calle's work questioned the nature of all truths.\n\nIn order to execute her project ''The Hotel'' (1981), she was hired as a [[maid|chambermaid]] at a hotel in [[Venice]] where she was able to explore the writings and objects of the hotel guests. Insight into her process and its resulting aesthetic can be gained through her account of  this project: \"I spent one year to find the hotel, I spent three months going through the text and writing it, I spent three months going through the photographs, and I spent one day deciding it would be this size and this frame...it's the last thought in the process.\"<ref>Hanhardt, John G. et al., ''Moving Pictures: Contemporary Photography and Video from the Guggenheim Collection''. (Hardcover) Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation (2003)</ref>\n\n=== Mid- and late 1980s ===\nOne of Calle's first projects to generate public [[controversy]] was ''Address Book'' (1983). The French daily newspaper ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]'' invited her to publish a series of 28 articles. Having recently found an address book on the street (which she photocopied and returned to its owner), she decided to call some of the telephone numbers in the book and speak with the people about its owner. To the transcripts of these conversations, Calle added photographs of the man's favorite activities, creating a portrait of a man she never met, by way of his acquaintances. The articles were published, but upon discovering them, the owner of the address book, a documentary filmmaker named Pierre Baudry, threatened to sue the artist for invasion of privacy. As Calle reports, the owner discovered a nude photograph of her, and demanded the newspaper publish it, in retaliation for what he perceived to be an unwelcome intrusion into his private life.\n\nAnother of Calle's noteworthy projects is titled ''The Blind'' (1986), for which she interviewed blind people, and asked them to define [[beauty]]. Their responses were accompanied by her photographic interpretation of their ideas of beauty, and portraits of the interviewees.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Sophie Calle, M'as-tu vue|last = |first = |publisher = Prestel Publishing|year = 2003|isbn = 3-7913-3035-7|location = Munich|pages = 377}}</ref>\n\nCalle has created elaborate display cases of birthday presents given to her throughout her life; this process was detailed by [[Gr\u00e9goire Bouillier]] in his memoir ''The Mystery Guest: An Account'' (2006). According to Bouillier, the premise of his story was that \"A woman who has left a man without saying why calls him years later and asks him to be the 'mystery guest' at a birthday party thrown by the artist Sophie Calle. And by the end of this fashionable\u2014and utterly humiliating\u2014party, the narrator figures out the secret of their breakup.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2006-09/express/bouillier|title=Experiential Lit: Gr\u00e9goire Bouillier with Yann Nicol Translated by Violaine Huisman and Lorin Stein|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nShe is fascinated by the interface between our public lives and our private selves. This has led her to investigate patterns of behaviour using techniques akin to those of a private investigator, a psychologist, or a forensic scientist. It has also led her to investigate her own behaviour so that her life, as lived and as imagined, has informed many of her most interesting works.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nIn 1996, Calle asked Israelis and Palestinians from [[Jerusalem]] to take her to public places that became part of their private sphere, exploring how one's personal story can create an intimacy with a place. Inspired by the [[eruv]], the Jewish law that permits to turn a public space into a private area by surrounding it with wires, making it possible to carry objects during the [[Sabbath]], the ''Erouv de J\u00e9rusalem'' is exposed at Paris's [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme]].\n\nThe same year, Calle released a film titled ''No Sex Last Night'' which she created in collaboration with [[United States|American]] photographer Gregory Shephard. The film documents their road trip across America, which ends in a wedding chapel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Rather than following the [[genre fiction|genre conventions]] of a road trip or a romance, the film is designed to document the result of a man and woman who barely knew each other, embarking on an intimate journey together.\n\nCalle asked writer and filmmaker [[Paul Auster]] to \"invent a fictive character which I would attempt to resemble\"<ref name=autogenerated1>Auster, Paul et al., ''Doubles-jeux: Gotham Handbook, livre VII''. (Paperback) Actes Sud, 1998</ref> and served as the model for the character Maria in Auster\u2019s novel [[Leviathan (1992 novel)|''Leviathan'' (1992)]]. This mingling of fact and fiction so intrigued Calle that she created the works of art created by the fictional character, which included a series of color-coordinated meals.\n\nAuster later challenged Calle to create and maintain a public amenity in [[New York City]]. The artist's response was to augment a [[telephone booth]] on the corner of [[Greenwich Street|Greenwich]] and Harrison Streets in [[Manhattan]] with a note pad, a bottle of water, a pack of cigarettes, flowers, cash, and sundry other items. Everyday, Calle cleaned the booth and restocked the items, until the telephone company removed and discarded them. This project is documented in  ''The Gotham Handbook'' (1998).<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1999 Calle exhibited the installation \"Appointment\" especially conceived for the [[Freud Museum]] in London, working with the ideas of her private desires. In ''Room with a View'' (2002), Calle spent the night in a bed installed at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. She invited people to come to her and read her bedtime stories in order to keep her awake through the night. The same year, Calle had her first one-woman show at the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\"Douleur Exquise\" (exquisite pain) was commissioned in 2003. She reluctantly chose to spend three months in Japan, deciding to make the journey take a month by taking the train through Moscow and through Siberia, then through Beijing, then to Hong Kong. She was supposed to meet her lover in New Delhi, but he didn't turn up, instead sending her a telegram which said he was in an accident and couldn't come. She found out that he only had an infected finger, a [[Whitlow|felon]], and that he had actually found another woman. She took a photograph every day until the day they were supposed to meet in New Delhi, and wrote about how much she looked forward to meeting him. The second half of the book was all about the pain of the heartbreak. She would write about the horrible memory of the conversation where she realized he was breaking up with her on one page, and ask people to tell her their worst memory, which was placed on the right. Over the days, her story became shorter and shorter as her pain dissipated over the time. The juxtaposition of everyone\u2019s terrible memories also played down the pain of a simple breakup.\n\nCalle's text ''Exquisite Pain'' was adapted into a performance in 2004 by Forced Entertainment, a theatrical company based in [[Sheffield]], [[England]].\n\nAt the 2007 [[Venice Biennale]], Sophie Calle showed her piece ''Take Care of Yourself'', named after the last line of the email her ex sent her. Calle asked friends, acquaintances, and recommended women of all ages\u2014including a parrot and a hand puppet\u2014to interpret the break-up e-mail and presented the results in the French pavilion.<ref>''Interview Magazine'' October 2014</ref>  Calle explains the piece as follows: \"I received an email telling me it was over.  I didn't know how to respond.  It was almost as if it hadn't been meant for me.  It ended with the words, 'take care of yourself.' And so I did.  I asked 107 women, chosen for their profession or skills, to interpret this letter.  To analyze it, comment on it, dance it, sing it.  Exhaust it.  Understand it for me.  Answer for me.  It was a way of taking the time to break up.  A way of taking care of myself.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/56|title=Sophie Calle|publisher=}}</ref> Jessica Lott, winner of the Frieze Writer's Prize for her review of the piece, described it thus: \"Take Care of Yourself is a break-up letter (Calle's) then-boyfriend ([[Gr\u00e9goire Bouillier]], dubbed \u2018X\u2019) sent her via e-mail. Calle took the e-mail, and the paralyzing confusion that accompanies the mind\u2019s failure to comprehend heartbreak, and distributed it to 107 women of various professions, skills and talents to help her understand it \u2013 to interpret, analyze, examine and perform it to gain perspective on her perplexing situation. Calle insists that she did not need the other women's sentiments for herself, but to ensure that the piece was well-rounded.<ref>''Interview Magazine''</ref>  The result of this seemingly obsessive, schoolyard exercise is paradoxically one of the most expansive and telling pieces of art on women and contemporary feminism to pass through (the major art centres) in recent years\".<ref>{{citation | title= Sophie Calle, Paula Cooper Gallery, New York, USA | author= Jessica Lott  | publisher=Frieze  | year= 2009 | url= http://www.frieze.com/writersprize/ | accessdate=2010-04-27 }}</ref>\n<ref>Neri, Louise.  \u201cSophie Calle.\u201d  www.interviewmagazine.com.

In 2010 another major exhibition opened in Denmark at the [[Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]].<ref>http://www.louisiana.dk/uk/Menu/Exhibitions/Sophie+Calle</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn 2011 her work \"True Stories\" was installed at the historic [[1850 House]] at the [[Pontalba Building]] at [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]] in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] as part of the [[Prospect New Orleans|Prospect 2 Contemporary Art Festival]]. The house, an historic museum that is managed as part of the [[Louisiana State Museum]], is furnished with historic furniture  as it was in the mid-19th century. The artist inserted her own, personal historical objects and ephemera, with short, narrative explanatory text, into the scenes, affecting the notion that she had occupied the house shortly before the viewers' arrival.\n\nIn 2012, Calle's ''The Address Book'' was published for the first time in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sigliopress.com/book/the-address-book/|title=The Address Book|work=Siglio Press}}</ref> In 2015, ''Suite V\u00e9nitienne'' was redesigned and republished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sigliopress.com/book/suite-venitienne/|title=Suite V\u00e9nitienne|work=Siglio Press}}</ref>\n\n== Critical analysis ==\nChristine Macel described Calle's work as a rejection of the [[Poststructuralist]] notion of the \"[[Death of the Author|death of the author]]\" by working as a \"first-person artist\" who incorporates her life into her works and, in a way, redefines the idea of the author.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Sophie Calle, M'as-tu vue|last = |first = |publisher = Prestel Publishing|year = 2003|isbn = 3-7913-3035-7|location = Munich|pages = 17}}</ref>\n\n== Cultural references ==\nIn 2001 an Australian art student Vienna Parreno legally changed her name by deed-poll to Sophie Calle and exhibited several recreations of Calle's photographs and installations in her graduation show at the College of Fine Arts at the University of NSW in Sydney.

(2014). ''Institutional Time.'' The Monacelli Press.</ref> and writer known for her large collaborative [[art installation]] pieces which examine the role of women in history and culture. Born in Chicago, Illinois, as Judith Cohen, she changed her name after the death of her father and her first husband, choosing to disconnect from the idea of male dominated naming conventions. By the 1970s, Chicago had coined the term \"[[feminist art]]\" and had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates stereotypical women's artistic skills, such as [[needlework]], counterbalanced with stereotypical male skills such as [[welding]] and [[pyrotechnics]]. Chicago's most well known work is ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', which resides in the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].\n\n==Early personal life==\n\nJudy Chicago was born Judith Sylvia Cohen<ref name=\"A305\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 305</ref> in 1939, to Arthur and May Cohen, in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her father came from a twenty-three generation lineage of [[rabbi]]s, including the [[Vilna Gaon]]. Unlike his family predecessors, Arthur became a [[labor organization|labor organizer]] and a [[Marxist]].<ref name=\"F279\"/> He worked nights at a post office and took care of Chicago during the day, while May, who was a former dancer, worked as a [[medical secretary]].<ref name=\"A305\"/><ref name=\"F279\"/> Arthur's active participation in the [[American Communist Party]], liberal views towards women and support of worker's rights strongly influenced Chicago's ways of thinking and belief.<ref name=\"A306\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 306</ref> During [[McCarthyism]] era in the 1950s, Arthur was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil.<ref name=\"F279\"/> In 1945, while Chicago was alone at home with her infant brother, Ben, an [[FBI]] agent visited their house. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted upon the return of May to the house.<ref name=\"A306\"/> Arthur's health declined, and he died in 1953 from [[peritonitis]]. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer attributed to unresolved [[grief]].<ref name=\"F279\">Felder and Rosen, 279.</ref>\n\nMay loved the arts, and instilled her passion for them in her children, as evident in Chicago's future as an artist, and brother Ben's eventual career as a [[pottery|potter]]. At age of three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] to attend classes.<ref name=\"F279\"/><ref name=\"W5\">Wydler and Lippard, 5.</ref> By the age of 5, Chicago knew that she \"never wanted to do anything but make art\"<ref name=\"W5\"/> and started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" />  She applied but was denied admission to the Art Institute,<ref name=\"A306\"/> and instead attended [[UCLA]] on a scholarship.<ref name=\"F279\"/>\n\n==Education and early career==\n\nWhile at UCLA she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA chapter [[NAACP]] and eventually became its corresponding secretary.<ref name=\"A306\"/> In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple [[hitch hike]]d to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her.<ref name=\"A308\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 308</ref> The couple lived in [[Greenwich Village]] for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961.<ref name=\"A311\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 311</ref> She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in 1962 and was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an [[identity crisis]] until later that decade. She received her [[Master of Fine Arts]] from UCLA in 1964.<ref name=\"F279\"/>\n\nWhile in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was [[abstract art|abstract]], yet easily recognized as male and female [[sexual organs]]. These early works were called ''Bigamy,'' and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract [[human penis|penis]] which was \"stopped in flight\" before it could unite with a [[vagina|vaginal form]]. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works.<ref name=\"A311\"/> Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.\n\nIn 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show.<ref name=\"Illustrated Career History\">{{cite web|last=Chicago|first=Judy|title=Illustrated Career History|url=http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php}}</ref> In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the \"California Women in the Arts\" exhibition at the [[Lytton Center]], to which she answered \"I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels.\" Chicago began working in [[ice sculpture]], which represented \"a metaphor for the preciousness of life,\" another reference towards her husband's death.<ref name=\"A314\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 314</ref>\n[[File:Pasadenalifesaversstudy.jpg|thumb|right|''Study for Pasadena Lifesavers,'' prismacolor, 1968.]]\n\nIn 1969, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an \"experimental\" gallery. ''[[Art in America]]'' noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the [[conceptual art]] movement, and the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the work as showing no signs of \"theoretical New York type art.\"<ref name=\"A314\"/> Chicago would describe her early artwork as [[minimalist]] and as her trying to be \"one of the boys\".<ref name=\"L455\">Lewis and Lewis, 455.</ref> Chicago would also experiment with [[performance art]], using [[fireworks]] and [[pyrotechnics]] to create \"atmospheres\", which involved flashes of colored smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to \"feminize\" and \"soften\" the landscape.<ref name=\"A315\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 315</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' which was a series of abstract paintings that placed [[acrylic paint]] on [[Plexiglas]]. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes \"turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle,\" representing her own discovery that \"I was [[orgasm|multi-orgasmic]].\" Chicago credited ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.<ref name=\"A315\"/>\n\n===From Cohen to Gerowitz to Chicago: Name change===\n\nAs Chicago made a name for herself as an artist, and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to her last name, Cohen. This was due to the late grief of the death of her father and the lost connection to her name through marriage, Judith Gerowitz, after her husband's death. She decided she wanted to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage.<ref name=\"F279\"/> During this time, she married sculptor [[Lloyd Hamrol]], in 1965. (They divorced in 1979.)<ref name=\"F280\">Felder and Rosen, 280.</ref> Gallery owner [[Rolf Nelson]] nicknamed her \"Judy Chicago\"<ref name=\"F279\"/> because of her strong personality and thick [[Chicago accent]]. She decided this would be her new name, and sought to change it legally. Chicago was described as being \"appalled\" by the fact that she had to have her new husband's signature on the paperwork to change her name legally.<ref name=\"F280\"/> To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed like a [[boxer]], wearing a [[sweatshirt]] with her new last name on it.<ref name=\"A315\"/> She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University at Fullerton]], that read: \"Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago.\"<ref name=\"F280\"/> An advertisement with the same statement was also placed in ''[[Artforum]]'s'' October 1970 issue.<ref name=Levin2007p139>[[#SrcLevin2007|Levin, ''Becoming Judy Chicago; A Biography of the Artist'', p. 139]]</ref>\n\n==Artistic career==\n\n===The feminist art movement and the 1970s===\nIn 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at [[Fresno State College]], hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work.<ref name=\"A317\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 317</ref> At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\"<ref name=\"A318\">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 318</ref> She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the [[Feminist Art Program]], a full 15-unit program, in the Spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, [[Chris Rush]], Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. Later, Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] reestablished the [[Feminist Art Program]] at [[California Institute of the Arts]]. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{refn|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] [[Gallery 25]] with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.<ref name=\"Fresno1\">{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nChicago is considered one of the \"first-generation feminist artists,\" a group that also includes [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], and [[Rachel Rosenthal]]. They were part of the [[Feminist art movement]] in Europe and the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|United States]] in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.<ref>{{cite book | author=Thomas Patin and Jennifer McLerran | title=Artwords: A Glossary of Contemporary Art Theory |location=Westport, CT | publisher=Greenwood | year=1997 |page=55 | url=http://www.questia.com/read/27960870 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)</ref>\n\nChicago became a teacher at the [[California Institute for the Arts]], and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created [[Womanhouse]], alongside [[Miriam Schapiro]], which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art.<ref name=\"F280\"/> With [[Arlene Raven]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]], Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]] in 1973.<ref name=\"AAA\">{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Woman's Building records, 1970-1992 | work=[[Archives of American Art]] | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/womans-building-records-6347/more#biohist | accessdate=15 Aug 2011}}</ref> This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \u201can experimental program in female education in the arts.

These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \"feminine\". Chicago was strongly influenced by [[Gerda Lerner]], whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of [[women's history]] would continue to struggle independently and collectively.<ref name=\"F280\"/>\n\n===Womanhouse===\n{{main|Womanhouse}}\nWomanhouse was a project that involved Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro. It began in the fall of 1971. They wanted to start the year with a large scale collaborative project that involved woman artists who spent much of their time talking about their problems as women. They used those problems as fuel and dealt with them while working on the project. Judy thought that female students often approach artmaking with an unwillingness to push their limits due to their lack of familiarity with tools and processes, and an inability to see themselves as working people. \n\u201cThe aim of the Feminist Art Program is to help women restructure their personalities to be more consistent with their desires to be artists and to help them build their artmaking out of their experiences as women.\u201d<ref name=Schapiro>{{cite web|last1=Schapiro|first1=Miriam|last2=Chicago|first2=Judy|title=Womanhouse catalog essay|url=http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|publisher=Womanhouse|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Chicago's first book, ''Through the Flower'', was published; it \"chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist.\"<ref name=\"Illustrated Career History\" />\n\n===''The Dinner Party''===\n[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.JPG|thumb|right|''[[The Dinner Party]]'' as installed at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]\n{{Main|The Dinner Party}}\n\nChicago decided to take Lerner's lesson to heart and took action to teach women about ''their'' history. This action would become Chicago's [[masterpiece]], ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', now in the collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].<ref name=\"BM1\">{{cite web | author= | year= | title=The Dinner Party | work=Elizabeth A.

The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in [[needlework]], creating sculptures and other aspects of the process.<ref name=\"F281\">Felder and Rosen, 281.</ref>\n\n===''The Birth Project'' and ''Powerplay''===\n\nFrom 1980 until 1985, Chicago created ''The Birth Project''. The piece used images of [[childbirth]] to celebrate woman's role as mother. The installation reinterpreted the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which focused on the idea that a male [[god]] created a male human, [[Adam]], without the involvement of a woman.<ref name=\"F281\"/> Chicago described the piece as revealing a \"primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation.\"<ref name=\"W5\"/> 150 needleworkers from the United States, [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by [[quilting]], [[macrame]], [[embroidery]] and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from ''The Birth Project'' are held in the collection of the [[Albuquerque Museum]].<ref name=\"F281\"/>\n\nIt is interesting to note that Chicago was not personally interested in motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path, she did not find it right for herself. As recently as 2012, she has said \"There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Rachel|title=The art of Judy Chicago|url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/04/judy-chicago-art-feminism-britain|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Birth Project'', Chicago returned to independent studio work. She created ''Powerplay,'' a series of drawings, [[weaving]]s, paintings, [[cast paper]] and bronze [[reliefs]]. Through the series, Chicago replaced the male [[gaze]] with a feminist one, exploring the construct of masculinity and how power has affected men.<ref name=\"JVL\">{{cite web | author= | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | work= | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/jchicago.html | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}</ref>\n\n===A new kind of collaboration and ''The Holocaust Project''===\n\nIn the mid-1980s Chicago's interests \"shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\">{{cite journal | title=Judy Chicago in the UK | author=Galit Mana | journal=[[Jewish Renaissance]] |date=October 2012 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=42\u201343}}</ref> Chicago's ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' (1985\u201393)<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> is a collaboration with her husband, photographer [[Donald Woodman]], whom she married on [[New Year's Eve]] 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both [[Jewish]], it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage.  Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an [[epic poem]] about the [[Holocaust]]. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish.<ref name=\"F281\"/> The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben, from [[Lou Gehrig's disease]], and the death of her mother from [[cancer]].<ref name=\"F282\">Felder and Rosen, 282.</ref>\n\nTo seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at  [[Nazi concentration camps]] and other relevant Holocaust sites.<ref name=\"F282\"/> They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust.<ref name=\"W6\"/> They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited [[Israel]].<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as [[environmentalism]], [[Native American genocide]],<ref name=\"W5\"/> and the [[Vietnam War]]. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust.<ref name=\"F282\"/> This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns.<ref name=\"W5\"/> ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: [[tapestry]], [[stained glass]], metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the [[sewing]] of [[Audrey Cowan]]. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].

For the exhibition, she returned to the [[Pomona College]] football field, where in the late 1960s she had held a firework-based installation, and performed the piece again.<ref name=\"LAT1\">{{cite web | author=Jori Finkel | year=2011 | title=Q&A Judy Chicago | work=Censorship | publisher=Los Angeles Times | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/30/entertainment/la-ca-pst-judy-chicago-and-rebecca-mcgrew-2-20111030 | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nChicago had two solo exhibitions in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2012, one in [[London]] and another in [[Liverpool]].<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/> The Liverpool exhibition included the launch of Chicago's book about [[Virginia Woolf]]. Once a peripheral part of her artistic expression, Chicago now considers writing to be well integrated into her career.<ref name=\"Jewish Renaissance\"/>\n\nChicago strives to push herself, exploring new directions for her art; she even attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has recently begun to work in glass.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /> Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago's philosophy: \"I'm not career driven. Damien Hirst's dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /> Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of ''The Dinner Party''. In the words of the artist: \"I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\" />\n\n==Style and work==\nChicago trained herself in \"macho arts,\" taking classes in auto body work, [[boat building]], and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned [[spray painting]] techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create [[fireworks]] for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring [[fiberglass]] and [[metal]] into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under [[Mim Silinsky]] to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in ''The Dinner Party''. Chicago also added the skill of [[stained glass]] to her artistic tool belt, which she used for ''The Holocaust Project''.<ref name=\"F280\"/> Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed.<ref name=\"W6\">Wylder and Lippard, 6</ref>  Since 2003, Chicago has been working with [[glass]].<ref name=\"PSU\"/>\n\nCollaboration is a major aspect of Chicago's installation works. ''The Dinner Party'', ''The Birth Project'' and ''The Holocaust Project'' were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to \"stereotypical\" women's arts such as [[textile arts]].<ref name=\"F280\"/><ref name=\"F282\"/> Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed.<ref name=\"The Guardian\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gerhard|first1=Jane|title=The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the power of popular feminism. 1970-2007|date=2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=0-8203-3675-0|pages=2, 228}}</ref>\n\n==Through the Flower==\n\nIn 1978, Chicago founded [[Through the Flower]], a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women's achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago's works, having handled the storage of ''The Dinner Party,'' before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a \"living curriculum\" for education about feminist art ideas and [[pedagogy]]. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.<ref name=\"PSU\"/>\n\n==Teaching career==\n\nChicago developed an art education methodology in which \u201cfemale-centered content,\u201d such as menstruation and giving birth, is encouraged by the teacher as \"[[The_personal_is_political|personal is political]]\" content for art.<ref>Chicago, Judy, (n.d.).

She earned her Master of Arts degree from the School of Visual Communication within the Scripps College of Communication at [[Ohio University]]. \n\n==Career beginnings==\nShe began her career in 1986 as a staff photographer with the ''[[El Paso Herald-Post]]'', a position which she occupied until 1988. She then moved to the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' for two years, before spending another two years as a freelance photographer in [[Mexico City]], working with newspapers such as the ''Los Angeles Times'', ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', and ''[[Business Week]]''. In 1992, Cole returned to being a staff photographer, working for ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'', before moving to the ''Times'' in 1994.\n\n==Recognitions==\nIn 1994, the same year she moved to the ''Times'', she was recognized in their editorial awards for her pictures of the crisis in [[Haiti]]. The following year, she was recognized again, this time for her work in Russia. In 1997, she gained attention for her photographs of dying bank robber [[Emil Matasareanu]], who had been shot after a nationally televised [[North Hollywood shootout|shootout]] with police. Her evidence was used in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by his family. Her pictures also helped the Times win a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the event. Later that year, she was named Journalist of the Year by the [[Times Mirror Corporation]]. In 2002, she received the [[National Press Photographers Association]] Newspaper Photographer of the Year award for the first time. In mid-2003, Cole went to [[Liberia]], as rebels surrounded the capital, [[Monrovia]], demanding the resignation of President [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]]. This trip was to earn her the [[2004 Pulitzer Prize]], \"for her cohesive, behind-the-scenes look at the effects of civil war in Liberia, with special attention to innocent citizens caught in the conflict.\" She won the 2003 [[George Polk Award]] for photojournalism.\n\nIn 2004, Cole was named both NPPA Newspaper Photographer of the Year for a second time, for her work in both Liberia and [[Iraq]], and the Pictures of the Year International Newspaper Photographer by the [[University of Missouri]]'s [[Missouri School of Journalism]]. This made her the first person ever to win all three of America's top photojournalism awards in the same year. During the year, she also spent time in [[Haiti]], witnessing the fall of the regime of [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]].\nCole has also received the [[Robert Capa Gold Medal]] from the Overseas Press Club in both 2003 and 2004,<ref name=\"E&P2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/carolyn-cole-wins-another-major-photo-award|title=Carolyn Cole Wins Another Major Photo Award|work=[[Editor & Publisher]]|last1=DeFoore|first1=Jay|date=30 April 2004|accessdate=2016-06-16}}</ref> and won two World Press Photo awards in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpressphoto.org/index.php?option=com_contact&task=view&contact_id=440&type=gallery&Itemid=146 |title=World Press Photo |publisher=World Press Photo |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, she won the NPPA Newspaper Photographer of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nppa.org/news_and_events/news/2007/03/bop13.html |title=Carolyn Cole Named Photojournalist Of The Year (Large Markets) |publisher=Nppa.org |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Issues with the law==\nIn April 2000, Cole was arrested on felony charges for \"throwing deadly missiles\" at police during protests in Miami's \"Little Havana\" during the [[Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez affair]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/24/news/mn-22870|title=Police Say Staffer Threw Rocks|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2015-08-27|date=2000-04-24}}</ref> Cole and the ''Times'' denied the charges, which were later dropped.<ref>http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news-media-law/news-media-and-law-summer-2000/reporter-arrests-continue-o</ref>\n\n==Kosovo, Afghanistan & the Siege of the Church of the Nativity==\nCole spent time in [[Kosovo]] during the 1999 crisis, and in 2001, spent two months in [[Afghanistan]].

Then, on May 2, she made a last-minute decision to join a group of peace activists who entered the building in solidarity with the Palestinians. Over the nine days that followed, she doubled as a news reporter for the Times, filing several stories. She was the only photojournalist in the building itself.

After graduating, she came to the United States in 1964 to study at [[the School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] where she continued her studies in design and illustration. A majority of her earlier work was for the editorial and advertising market. \n\nCraft illustrated the cover art of the older editions of Shakespeare's work for the Folger Library.  She has a passionate love of European fine art and draws on a deep knowledge of European art history in creating her work. She is most inspired by the works of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], and [[Symbolist painters]]. Her work is done with a combination of artist oils and watercolor on clayboard gesso panels.\n\nCraft has illustrated eight picture books (fairy tale and classic mythology) designed for children and young readers. Since the mid-1990s, she has concentrated her efforts on art for fantasy book jackets. Her art has included paintings for the book covers of many well-known fantasy authors such as [[Patricia A. McKillip]], [[Juliet Marillier]], and [[Tanith Lee]]. She has also designed opera posters, fairy tale books and painted cover art for many national magazines such as ''Time'', ''Newsweek'', and ''National Geographic''.\n\nShe has collaborated with many authors and worked with her husband Mahlon F. Craft and her daughter Marie Charlotte Craft. Her original paintings, drawings, and limited-edition prints are represented by Borsini-Burr Gallery in [[Montara, California]], and other galleries.\n\nHer art has been licensed on calendars, posters, greeting cards, and other consumer goods. Her fairy tale books are currently distributed in the USA, other English-speaking countries, Europe, Greece, China, and Korea. She has received numerous awards for her work, including several gold and silver medals from [[the Society of Illustrators]], New York, NY. Ms. Craft\u2019s work can be found in the collections of [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)]], the Museum of American Illustration in New York City, the National Geographic Society, and other corporate collections.\n\nShe has been nominated five times since 2001 as a Best Artist for the [[World Fantasy Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|author=World Fantasy Convention|year= 2010|title=Award Winners and Nominees|url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html/|accessdate= 4 Feb 2011}}</ref> and won the World Fantasy Award for Best Artist in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/announcing-the-2011-world-fantasy-award-winners|title=Announcing the 2011 World Fantasy Award Winners}}</ref>\n\nCraft has also lectured and given workshops at numerous art schools, universities, and organizations, including Art Center College of Art and Design, San Jose State University, Rhode Island School of Design, Philadelphia College of the Arts (2012), and more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kycraft.com/biography.html|title=Kinuko Y Craft Biography}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n===Collections===\n* ''Kinuko Craft Drawings and Paintings: V. 1'' (Imaginosis, 2007)\n\n===Children's picture book illustration===\n* ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'', translated by Lucy Crane (Scott Foresman Reading Systems, 1970)\n* ''[[Gingerbread]] Children (Poems)'', by Ilo Orleans (Follett, 1973)\n* ''Bear, Wolf and Mouse'', by Jan Wahl  (Follett, 1975)\n* ''Come Play With Me'', by [[Margaret Hillert]] (Modern Curriculum Press, 1975)\n* ''Mother Goose ABC'' (Platt & Munk, 1977)\n* ''[[Tower of Geburrah|The Tower of Geburah]]'' by John White (IVP, 1978 edition only)\n* ''The Black Swan'', by Paula Z.

It was a blue tent, appliqu\u00e9d with the names of everyone she has slept with. These included sexual partners, plus relatives she slept with as a child, her twin brother, and her two aborted children. Although often talked about as a shameless exhibition of her sexual conquests, it was rather a piece about intimacy in a more general sense. The needlework which is integral to this work was used by Emin in a number of her other pieces. This piece was later bought by [[Charles Saatchi]] and included in the successful 1997 [[Sensation exhibition]] at the [[Royal Academy of London]]; it then toured to Berlin and New York. It, too, was destroyed by the fire in Saatchi's east London warehouse, in 2004.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3748179.stm \"Fire devastates Saatchi artworks\"], BBC, 26 May 2004; retrieved 25 February 2008.</ref>\n\n===Public Recognition===\nAlthough these early events caused Emin to be well known in art circles, she was largely unknown by the public until she appeared on a [[Channel 4]] television programme in 1997.

Other drawings highlighted ''The things you did to help other people'' written next to a drawing by Emin of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola. Another work was a delicate sketch of a rose drawn next to the phrase \"It makes perfect sence to know they killed you\" (with Emin's trademark spelling mistakes) referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death. Emin herself described the drawings, saying they \"could be considered quite scrappy, fresh, kind of naive looking drawings\" and \"It's pretty difficult for me to do drawings not about me and about someone else.

Emin spoke out angrily against what she perceived as a general public lack of sympathy, and even amusement, at the loss of the artworks in the fire.<ref name=\"Kino\" /> However, she also put the loss in her perspective, commenting, \"I'm also upset about those people whose wedding got bombed last week [in Iraq], and people being dug out from under 400ft of mud in the Dominican Republic.\"<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1227746,00.html \"They said what?\"] ''The Guardian'', 30 May 2004; retrieved 25 February 2008.</ref>\n\n==Artistic work==\n\n===Monoprints===\nEmin's [[monoprints]] are a well documented part of her creative output. These unique drawings represent a diaristic aspect and frequently depict events from the past for example, ''Poor Love'' (1999), ''From The Week of Hell '94'' (1995) and ''Ripped Up'' (1995), which relate to a traumatic experience after an abortion or other personal events as seen in ''Fuck You Eddy'' (1995) and ''Sad Shower in New York'' (1995) which are both part of the Tate's collection of Emin's art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/tracey-emin-2590|title=Tracey Emin \u2013 Tate|work=Tate}}</ref>\n\nOften they incorporate text as well as image, although some bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist's stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin's text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin's scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to the speed at which she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with [[Lynn Barber]], Emin said, \"It's not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited and say I can't write because I can't spell, I just write and get on with it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkettart.com/qwr/set_library.php3?directory=63|title=PARKETT Books|website=parkettart.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmin created a key series of monoprints in 1997 with the text ''Something's Wrong''<ref>Terrebly Wrong (1997)</ref> or ''There Must Be Something Terebley Wrong With Me''<ref>''Something'' (1997)</ref> {{sic}} written with spelling mistakes intact in large capital letters alongside \"forlorn figures surrounded by space, their outlines fragile on the page.

In The Livingroom'' (1994). Emin further produced a set of monoprints detailing her memories of [[Margate]]'s iconic buildings such as ''Margate Harbour 16/5/95'' (1995), ''The Lido 16/5/95'' (1995) and ''Light House 15/5/95'' (1995).

The bath theme seen in these watercolours was later revisited by Emin in her photographic work ''Sometimes I Feel Beautiful'' (2000) and in monoprints such as the ''Bath White'' (2005) series. With all these works, Emin explores a [[Mary Cassatt]] quality of the \"woman in a private moment\".\n\nEmin's focus on painting has developed over the past few years, starting with the ''Purple Virgin'' (2004) acrylic watercolour series of purple brush strokes depicting her naked open legs, and leading to paintings such as ''Asleep Alone With Legs Open'' (2005), the ''Reincarnation'' (2005) series and ''Masturbating'' (2006), among others.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn May 2005, London's ''[[Evening Standard]]'' newspaper highlighted Emin's return to painting in their preview of her ''When I Think About Sex'' exhibition at [[White Cube]].

The photograph shows the artist sitting in an upholstered chair in [[Monument Valley]], a spectacular location on the southern border of Utah with northern Arizona, holding her book. Although it is open, it is not clear whether she is looking at the viewer or at the text in front of her. Emin gave her readings sitting in the chair, which she had inherited from her grandmother, which also became part of Emin's art, ''There's A Lot of Money in Chairs'' (1994).\"<ref name=\"MV\">[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/emin-monument-valley-grand-scale-t11888 \"Monument Valley\"], Tate.org.uk; retrieved 25 November 2014.</ref>\n\nOther photographic works include a series of nine images comprising the work ''Naked Photos \u2013 Life Model Goes Mad'' (1996) documenting a painting performance Emin made in a room specially built in Galleri Andreas Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, Stockholm. Another photographic series, ''Trying on Clothes From My Friends (She Took The Shirt Off His Back)'' (1997), shows the artist trying on her friends' clothes offering up questions of identity.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nOther works such as ''I've Got It All'' (2000) show Emin with her \"legs splayed on a red floor, clutching banknotes and coins to her crotch. Made at a time of public and financial success, the image connects the artist's desire for money and success and her sexual desire (her role as consumer) with her use of her body and her emotional life to produce her art (the object of consumption)\",<ref name=\"MV\"/> while ''Sometimes I Feel Beautiful'' (2000) pictures Emin lying alone in a bath. Both these works are examples of her using \"large-scale photographs of herself to record and express moments of emotional significance in her life, frequently making reference to her career as an artist. The photographs have a staged quality, as though the artist is enacting a private ritual.\"<ref name=\"MV\"/>\n\nEmin's two self-portraits taken inside her beach hut, ''The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here I'' (2000) and ''The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here II'' (2000) are a diptych although they are often exhibited and sold separately. They depict a naked Emin on her knees inside her beach hut which she and friend [[Sarah Lucas]] had bought in Whitstable, Kent in 1992.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The hut itself later became the sculpture ''The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut)'' (1999). They are part of museum collections including [[Tate Modern]], the [[Saatchi Gallery]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] and have been mass produced as postcards sold in museum shops around the world.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Neon===\nThough typically used for public address and advertisements, like bar signs, vacancy signs and the all too familiar 'Girls, Girls, Girls' sign, Emin interestingly uses neon to communicate her private sentiments and intimate emotions, once more exploring the dichotomy between public and private.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nEmin has also worked with [[neon]] lights. One such piece is ''You Forgot To Kiss My Soul'' (2001)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitecube.com/exhibitions/youforgottokissmysoul/5|title=White Cube \u2013 You forgot to kiss my soul|publisher=Whitecube.com|date=26 May 2001|accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref> which consists of those words in blue neon inside a neon heart-shape.

For example, ''Legs IV'' (2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artwork/425153950/424046260/tracey-emin-legs-iv.html|title=Art Galleries on artnet|publisher=}}</ref> directly follows the watercolour lines of the ''Purple Virgin 9'' (2004). For a joint 2010 exhibition with Paula Rego and Mat Collishaw she decorated the front of the Foundling Museum with the neon words \"Foundlings and fledglings are angels of this earth\".<ref name=\"Alex Healey\"/>\n\nEmin has donated neon work to auction for charity and in 2007, her neon ''Keep Me Safe'' reached the highest price ever made for one of her neon works of over \u00a360,000.<ref name=autogenerated8>{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artmarketwatch/artmarketwatch6-22-07.asp|title=Art Market Watch \u2013 artnet Magazine|date=30 May 2007|website=artnet.com}}</ref> A brand new neon piece called ''With You I Want To Live'' was shown as part of Emin's ''You Left Me Breathing'' exhibition in 2007 at the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles.<ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/beverly-hills-2007-11-tracey-emin/ The image of the neon is being used in publicity surrounding the forthcoming exhibition of new Emin work], gagosian.com, November 2007; accessed 6 May 2016.</ref>\n\n===Fabric===\nEmin frequently works with fabric in the form of appliqu\u00e9s \u2013 material (often cut out into lettering) sewn onto other material. She collects fabric from curtains, bed sheets and linen and has done so for most of her life. She keeps such material that holds emotional significance for later use in her work. Many of her large-scale appliqu\u00e9s are made on hotel linens, for example, ''It Always Hurts'' (2005), ''Sometimes I Feel So Fucking Lost'' (2005), ''Volcano Closed'' (2001) and ''Helter Fucking Skelter'' (2001). ''Hate And Power Can Be A Terrible Thing'' (2004), part of the Tate's collection of Emin's work, is a large-scale blanket inspired in part by Margaret Thatcher due to her involvement in \"an attack on 800 boys and men in the Argentinian navy\" and other women for example women who steals their friends' boyfriends, Emin says of this work \"about the kind of women I hate, the kind of women I have no respect for, women who betray and destroy the hearts of other women\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/btseries/bb/traceyemin|title=BT Series \u2013 Tracey Emin|website=tate.org.uk|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmin's use of fabric is diverse, one of her most famous works came from sewing letters onto her grandmother's armchair in ''There's A Lot of Money in Chairs'' (1994). The chair was very detailed, \"including her and her twin brother's names, the year of her grandmother's birth (1901) and the year of her birth (1963) on either side of the words '''another world''', referring to the passing of time. An exchange between the artist and her grandmother using the nicknames they had for each other: \u2018''Ok Puddin, Thanks Plum''\u2019, covers the bottom front of the chair and a saying of Emin\u2019s grandmother's, \"There's a lot of money in chairs\", is appliqu\u00e9d in pink along the top and front of its back. Behind the chair back, the first page of ''Exploration of the Soul'', handwritten onto fabric, is appliqu\u00e9d together with other dictums such as, \u2018''It\u2019s not what you inherit. It\u2019s what you do with your inheritance''\u2019\".<ref name=\"MV\"/>\n\nEmin used the chair on a trip Emin made to the United States in 1994. Driving from San Francisco to New York stopping off along the way to give readings from her book, ''Exploration of the Soul'' (1994). Emin gave her readings sitting in the upholstered chair and \"as she crossed the United States, the artist sewed the names of the places she visited \u2013 San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Monument Valley, Detroit, Pittsburgh, New York \u2013 onto the front of the chair\".<ref name=\"MV\"/> Emin also posed in the chair for two of her photographic works (see Photography) while in Monument Valley, in the Arizona Desert. It is currently on public display at Pallant House Gallery until 6 March 2011 as part of the exhibition, [http://www.pallant.org.uk/exhibitions/current/main-galleries/contemporary-eye-crossovers1/contemporary-eye-crossovers 'Contemporary Eye: Crossovers'], pallant.org.uk; accessed 6 May 2016.\n\nEmin has made a large number of smaller-scale works, often including hand sewn words and images, such as ''Falling Stars'' (2001), ''It Could Have Been Something'' (2001), ''Always Sorry'' (2005) and ''As Always'' (2005).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nOn 13 April 2007, Emin launched a specially designed flag made out of fabric with the message ''One Secret Is To Save Everything'' written in orange-red letters across the banner made up of hand-sewn swimming sperm. Tracey Emin's flag, at 21 feet by 14 feet, flew above the Jubilee Gardens in the British capital until 31 July 2007, with the parliament building and the London Eye as backdrops. Emin called the artwork \"a flag made from wishful thinking\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6553327.stm|work=BBC News|title=Artist Emin unveils cryptic flag|date=13 April 2007|accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref> The flag was commissioned by the South Bank Centre in London's Waterloo.\n\nIn June 2007, on returning from the [[Venice Biennale]], Emin donated a piece of artwork, a handsewn blanket called ''Star Trek Voyager'' to be auctioned at [[Elton John]]'s annual glamorous White Tie & Tiara Ball to raise money for The Elton John AIDS Foundation.

The most well known example is ''[[My Bed]]'', where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from [[Whitstable]] to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled ''The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut)'' (1999).\n\nShe revisited the theme of the bed in 2002, with the mixed media installation, ''To Meet My Past'' (2002),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/artpages/tracey_emin_meet_my_past2.htm|title=Saatchi Gallery|author=Saatchi Gallery|publisher=}}</ref> another installation with a [[four poster bed]] with embroidered text such as ''Weird Sex'' and ''To Meet My Past'' hanging down alongside the mattress.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nEmin also incorporated stones and rocks which had been thrown through her window in a mixed media piece in her 2005 show. The work consists of a [[monoprint]] of herself sitting on a chair with the stones lined up below the drawing in a vitrine.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n''The Leg'' (2004) included a plaster cast inside a vitrine, kept by the artist after she broke her leg, exhibited alongside a C-print photograph of the artist wearing the cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitecube.com/exhibitions/whenithinkaboutsex/7/|title=Exhibitions|website=WhiteCube.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Sculpture===\nIn February 2005, Emin's first public artwork, a bronze sculpture, went on display outside the Oratory, adjacent to [[Liverpool Cathedral]]. It consists of a small bird perched on a tall bronze pole, and is designed so that the bird seems to disappear when viewed from the front. It was commissioned by the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4293245.stm|title=Emin unveils 'sparrow' sculpture|publisher=BBC News|date=24 February 2005|accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> \"Emin's work stands outside The Oratory, in Upper Duke Street just outside the Cathedral.

Emin loaned this work to the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] in 2005,{{quote|The death mask, which enjoyed a popular revival in the nineteenth century, was a method for preserving the final expression and physiognomy of the famous or infamous, largely based on the belief that facial features and proportion could explain personal attributes such as genius or criminality.

The red appliqu\u00e9 fabric on which Emin's bronze head is placed refers to the frequent use of quilting and embroidery in her work, associated with the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] of women, which challenges masculine frameworks of history and art history. Emin, whose work is often based on images of herself, once commented \"It is like they have seen my art by seeing me\". In this work she offers herself in perpetuity as an enclosed specimen or museum display, literally transforming herself into an object for the scrutiny of generations to come.<ref>[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/wotraceyemin.asp What's on?: Death Mask by Tracey Emin, npg.org.uk; accessed 10 May 2016.]</ref>}}\n\nAt Emin's 2007 ''Venice Biennale'' exhibition, as well as the central exhibition's ''Tower'' sculptures, tall wooden towers consisting of small pieces of timber piled together, a new small bronze-cast sculpture work of a child's pink sock was revealed ''Sock'' (2007) on display on the steps of the British Pavilion.<ref>[http://www.britishcouncil-venice.org/images/200.jpg ''Sock'' (image)], britishcouncil-venice.org; accessed 10 May 2016.</ref> Her exhibition again attracted widespread UK media coverage, both positive and negative.<ref name=\"Kino\"/>\n\nIn September 2007, Emin announced she would be exhibiting new sculpture work in the inaugural [[Folkestone]] Triennial which took place in the Kent town from June until September 2008.

Emin showed Wark some work-in-progress, which included large-scale canvases with paintings of Emin's legs and vagina. Starting with the ''Purple Virgin'' (2004) acrylic watercolour series with their strong purple brush strokes depicting Emin's naked open legs, leading to Emin's paintings in 2005-6 such as ''Asleep Alone With Legs Open'' (2005), the ''Reincarnation'' (2005) series and ''Masturbating'' (2006) amongst others, these works are a significant new development in her artistic output.\n\nAndrea Rose, the British Pavilion commissioner, added to this commenting on the art Emin has produced, \"It's remarkably ladylike. There is no ladette work \u2013 no toilet with a poo in it \u2013 and actually it is very mature I think, quite lovely. She is much more interested in formal values than people might expect, and it shows in this exhibition. It's been revelatory working with her.

Instead Emin discusses sexism from the viewpoint of the being a female victim. Though Emin's subversion of feminine stereotypes, Sophie Lloyd in her article describes her work as, \"\u2026[embodying] a change in perception of female sexuality that was in line with third-wave feminism, with women defining beauty and sexuality on their own terms.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=WHAT TRACEY EMIN'S BED DID FOR FEMINISM|url=http://untitled-magazine.com/what-tracey-emins-bed-did-for-feminism/#.VmXxzITXmgR|website=untitled-magazine.com|accessdate=7 December 2015}}</ref> By narrating such harrowed and tortured memories, Emin uses vulnerability to tell not only her own struggles, but the struggles that many women may face while finding themselves.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nEmin openly discusses her 1998 installation ''[[My Bed]]'' for audiences and interviewers alike.

Feminist writers have reviewed Emin's pieces as containing, \"\u2026no element of eroticism or titillation\u2026unlike in Botticelli, Renoir or Klimt. Nor is it sexual fantasy or dreams, as we might find in surrealism, or the sex of the brothel featured so heavily in late 19th-century French art.

In the 1960s and 1970s Friedlander evolved an influential and often imitated visual language of urban \"social landscape,\" with many of his photographs including fragments of store-front reflections, structures framed by fences, posters and street signs.\n\n==Life and work==\nFriedlander studied photography at the [[Art Center College of Design]] in Pasadena, California. In 1956, he moved to [[New York City]] where he photographed [[jazz]] musicians for record covers. His early work was influenced by [[Eug\u00e8ne Atget]], [[Robert Frank]], and [[Walker Evans]]. In 1960 Friedlander was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to focus on his art, and was awarded subsequent grants in 1962 and 1977. Some of his most famous photographs appeared in the September 1985 [[Playboy (magazine)|''Playboy'']], black and white nude photographs of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] from the late 1970s. A student at the time, she was paid only $25 for her 1979 set. In 2009, one of the images fetched $37,500 at a [[Christie's]] Art House auction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/12/madonna.photo.auction/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title=Nude photo of Madonna goes for $37,500 |date=12 February 2009 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>\n\nWorking primarily with [[Leica Camera|Leica]] hand-held [[135 film|35 mm]] cameras and [[black-and-white]] film, Friedlander's style focused on the \"social landscape\". His photographs used detached images of urban life, store-front reflections, structures framed by fences, and posters and signs all combining to capture the look of modern life.\n\nIn 1963, [[Nathan Lyons]], Assistant Director and Curator of Photography at the International Museum of Photography at [[George Eastman House]] mounted Friedlander's first solo exhibition.<ref name=\"utpress.utexas.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/mcdnat |title=McDonald, Jessica.

His book, ''Stems,'' reflects his life during the time of his knee replacement surgery. He has said that his \"limbs\" reminded him of plant stems. These images display textures which were not a feature of his earlier work. In this sense, the images are similar to those of [[Josef Sudek]] who also photographed the confines of his home and studio.\n\nFriedlander began photographing parks designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] for a six-year commission from the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal beginning in 1988. After completing the commission he continued to photograph Olmsted parks, for twenty years in total. His series includes New York City's Central Park; Brooklyn's Prospect Park; Manhattan's Morningside Park; World's End in Hingham, Massachusetts; Cherokee Park in Louisville, Kentucky; and Niagara Falls State Park. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the design for Central Park, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] held an exhibition of Friedlander's photographs of that park and a book was published, ''Photographs: Frederick Law Olmsted Landscapes''.<ref name=\"met-olmsted\">{{cite web | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2008/lee-friedlander-a-ramble-in-olmsted-parks | accessdate = 8 February 2015 | publisher = [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] | title = Lee Friedlander: A Ramble in Olmsted Parks}}</ref><ref name=\"kennedy-nyt\">{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/arts/design/03frie.html?_r=0 | date = 3 January 2008 | accessdate = 8 February 2015 | first = Randy | last = Kennedy | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = Compositions That Come Naturally}}</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that Friedlander is \"notoriously media shy\".<ref name=\"kennedy-nyt\" />\n\nHe now works primarily with [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] cameras such as the [[Hasselblad]] Superwide.\n\n==Selected books==\n*''E.J.

She is mostly known for her collaboration work with [[Jan & Dean]] and for having briefly been a member of the successful 1960s rock group [[The Mamas & the Papas]]. She was also one of the main photographers at the historic [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967.\n\n==Early and personal life==\nJill Gibson was born in [[Los Angeles, California]] on June 18, 1942. She is half-English.<ref name=\"MelodyMaker\">''Melody Maker'', July 23, 1966, p. 4, Vol. 41, \"New Mama is definitely Jill\"</ref><ref name=\"SongHits\">''Song Hits'', November 1966, p.19, \"Everybody Loves the Mama's & Papa's\"</ref> Gibson attended [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]] in Los Angeles. She is a former model.<ref name=\"MelodyMaker\" /><ref name=\"SongHits\" /> \n\nIn 1975, she gave birth to a son, Mattia Borrani. Borrani has followed his mother's pursuit of a career in music and is the lead [[singing|singer]] and rhythm [[guitarist]] for the indie rock group [[Oslo (band)|Oslo]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Association with Jan & Dean===\nJill Gibson was studying at [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]] in Los Angeles, California when she met [[Jan Berry]] of [[Jan & Dean]] fame in 1959. The two were an item for the next seven years. Together they wrote over a dozen songs and through Berry, Gibson got more involved with the music scene. Eventually she began composing songs with other known songwriters such as Don Altfeld, [[George Tipton]] and [[Roger Christian (songwriter)|Roger Christian]], a Los Angeles-based disc jockey who also wrote with [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]].\n\nIn 1962 Jan Berry decided to create a female answer to Jan & Dean called [[Judy & Jill]], featuring Gibson with [[Dean Torrence]]'s girlfriend Judy Lovejoy. Demo recordings such as \"Come On Baby\" (written by Gibson and Lovejoy), \"Eleventh Minute\" (written by Gibson and Altfeld), \"Just For Tonight\", and \"Baby What's It Gonna Be\" were cut and produced by Berry for [[Liberty Records]].<ref>Jan Berry's Nevins-Kirshner and [[Screen Gems]] contracts in possession of Mark A. Moore.</ref> Gibson performed most of the leads on these unreleased demos. Nothing major happened with the Judy & Jill recordings, however, and Gibson switched to providing background vocals on several Jan & Dean album tracks. Meanwhile, she studied [[visual arts]] at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]].\n\nIn 1963, Gibson appeared on the Jan & Dean track \"Surf Route 101\", and the next year she performed backing harmony on a song she wrote with Don and Horace Altfeld called \"When It's Over\" for a Jan & Dean album.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/as-easy-as-1-2-3-mw0000041963 |title=As Easy as 1-2-3 - Jan & Dean &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=1998-08-11 |accessdate=2015-03-28}}</ref> She then recorded two vocal duets with Berry that she had written with Don Altfeld that year, \"It's As Easy As 1,2,3\" and \"A Surfer's Dream\".<ref name=\"jananddean-janberry.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/main/index.php/disc/disc63-64|title=Jan & Dean - Official Jan Berry Website - 1963-1964|author=Administrator|work=jananddean-janberry.com}}</ref> The tracks appeared on 2 different 1964 Jan & Dean albums.<ref name=\"jananddean-janberry.com\"/>\n\nIn November 1963 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television]] aired a one-hour special called ''Celebrity Party'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]] and [[Donna Loren]] that  included performances and/or appearances by Jill Gibson, Jan & Dean, The Beach Boys, Shelley Fabares, [[James Darren]], [[Connie Francis]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[The Challengers (band)|The Challengers]], [[Johnny Crawford]], [[Deborah Walley]], among others.<ref name=\"Independent Press Telegram' 1963, p. 18\">''Independent Press Telegram'' \"Tele Vues.\" November 17, 1963,  p. 18</ref> It was sponsored by [[Dr Pepper]].<ref name=\"Independent Press Telegram' 1963, p. 18\"/>\n\nGibson released her first solo recording in 1964, a cover version of her own song \"It's As Easy As 1,2,3\" backed with \"Jilly's Flip Side\", written by [[P.F. Sloan]] with [[Steve Barri]] and issued on [[Imperial Records]]. Jan Berry produced and arranged both tracks. She also sang backup on Jan & Dean's hit \"Ride the Wild Surf.\" Gibson co-wrote the B-side single \"He Don't Love Me\" for [[Shelley Fabares]]' ''More Teenage Triangle'' LP in 1964 with Berry.<ref>''The Best of Shelley Fabares.'' (booklet). by Brian Gari. 1994. Rhino Records. pp. 6  & 7</ref>\n\nIn July 1965, a hit song Gibson had co-written with Berry and Roger Christian, called \"You Really Know How To Hurt A Guy\", peaked at number 27 for Jan & Dean on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart.<ref name=\"Top Pop Singles1955-2008\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2008|publisher=Record Research|year=2009|edition=12|page=489|isbn=0-89820-180-2}}</ref>\n\nBy the time Gibson sang vocals on Jan & Dean's last studio album, ''Jan & Dean Meet Batman'', in 1966, her personal relationship with Berry was ending; they had gone their separate ways by the album's March 1966 release but remained friends. Shortly after their breakup, Berry was involved in a serious motor-vehicle accident on April 12, 1966, which he survived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/4614941/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/jan-dean-singerjan-berry-dies/ |title=Jan & Dean singer Berry dies \u2013 today > entertainment \u2013 Music |publisher=TODAY.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}</ref> Gibson often visited in the hospital during his long, difficult recovery. Later Gibson dated [[Lou Adler]], whom she had known since 1959 when he was the executive producer and manager of Jan Berry and [[Dean Torrence]]. Adler had recently separated from his wife, actress and singer [[Shelley Fabares]].\n\n\"Eleventh Minute\" was briefly released in 1997 as the B-side of a 45&nbsp;rpm record on the Maltshop Records label.  The licensed recording was soon withdrawn from sale (300 of the 500 red vinyl copies subsequently destroyed) due to questionable ownership of copyright and mechanical rights, as well as numerous label inaccuracies \u2013 most notably the performing artists are identified on the label of Maltshop 2 as \"Jody & Jill\". Furthermore, the A-side recording, \"Come On Baby\", was not the ballad demo offered to Liberty Records, but an up-tempo surf rocker by an unknown male singer and band.\n\nOn April 18, 2004 Jill Gibson was one of 400 invited guests who gathered at [[The Roxy Theatre]] in Hollywood, California, to celebrate Jan Berry's life and music at a tribute called \"Jan Berry: A Celebration of Life\". Other guests included Judy Lovejoy (her former singing partner), Dean Torrence, Don Altfeld (her former songwriting partner), Ann Marshall, [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], Lou Adler, [[Lloyd Thaxton]], Diane Rovell and Ginger Blake of [[The Honeys]]. The night featured live performances of Jan & Dean songs performed by artists who had once worked with Berry in the 1960s. The event had been planned by Berry's widow, Gertie, and Al Nassar.\n\nIn 2008, Jill Gibson recorded the duet ballad \"When It's Over\" with [[Cameron Michael Parkes]] for the Berry tribute album ''Encomium In Memoriam Vol. 1''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/album/jb-album-artists.html|title=Jan & Dean: Jan Berry Tribute Album \u2013 Encomium In Memoriam Vol. 1|work=jananddean-janberry.com}}</ref> The song \u201cWhen It\u2019s Over\u201d was originally written and recorded by Gibson with Jan Berry in 1964 that was issued as the B-side of Jan & Dean\u2019s hit single \"[[Sidewalk Surfin\u2019]].\u201d\n\n===The Mamas & the Papas===\nIt was through Adler that Gibson met the rock group [[The Mamas & the Papas]], a highly successful band Adler produced in the late 1960s. Occasionally, Gibson would visit Lou Adler in the studio while he was producing the band, who had just begun work on a new album. Gibson found herself in the right place at the right time when the leader of the group, John Phillips, fired his wife, [[Michelle Phillips|Michelle Gilliam Phillips]], from the band on Saturday, June 4, 1966, for having had an affair with [[Gene Clark]] of [[The Byrds]].<ref name=Michelle86>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Michelle|title=California Dreamin': The True Story of the Mamas and the Papas The Music, the Madness, the Magic that was |publisher=Warner Books|year=1986|edition=1|page=86|isbn=0-446-51308-3}}</ref><ref name=Hall102>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Doug|title=The Mamas & The Papas California Dreamin'|publisher=Quarry Press|year=2000|edition=1|page=102|isbn=1-55082-216-0}}</ref><ref name=Fiegel203>{{cite book|last=Fiegel|first=Eddi|title=Dream a Little Dream of Me: The Life of Cass Elliot|publisher=Pan Books|year=2006|edition=1|page=203|isbn=0-330-48751-5}}</ref> Instead of the group breaking up, they asked Jill Gibson to join The Mamas & the Papas as their newest member \"Mama Jill\".<ref name=Hall103>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Doug|title=The Mamas & The Papas California Dreamin'|publisher=Quarry Press|year=2000|edition=1|page=103|isbn=1-55082-216-0}}</ref><ref name=Greenwald137>{{cite book|last=Greenwald|first=Matthew|title=Go Where You Wanna Go: The Oral History of The Mamas and The Papas|publisher=Cooper Square Press|year=2002|edition=1|page=137|isbn=0-8154-1204-5}}</ref> Shortly after joining the band, The Mamas & the Papas, along with Lou Adler, left for [[Europe]] for several weeks to begin working together.<ref name=John149>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=John|title=Papa John: An Autobiography|publisher=Doubleday & Company Inc.|year=1986|edition=1|page=149|isbn=0-385-23120-2}}</ref>\n\nArriving in [[London, England]], Gibson, [[Cass Elliot]], [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], [[Denny Doherty]], and Lou Adler rented the top half of a large house in [[Berkeley Square]] to work in (the downstairs part was rented to [[Mick Jagger]] and model [[Chrissie Shrimpton]]).<ref name=John149/><ref name=Fiegel206>{{cite book|last=Fiegel|first=Eddi|title=Dream a Little Dream of Me: The Life of Cass Elliot|publisher=Pan Books|year=2006|edition=1|page=206|isbn=0-330-48751-5}}</ref> Over the next three weeks Gibson rehearsed with the group in London for the recording of the band's upcoming second album and for a few live shows.<ref name=Greenwald138>{{cite book|last=Greenwald|first=Matthew|title=Go Where You Wanna Go: The Oral History of The Mamas and The Papas|publisher=Cooper Square Press|year=2002|edition=1|page=138|isbn=0-8154-1204-5}}</ref> While in [[England]], the band had a series of business meetings, but still made time to party with [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Brian Jones]], and Mick Jagger at Dolly's (the private London rock club that catered to the stars).<ref name=John150>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=John|title=Papa John: An Autobiography|publisher=Doubleday & Company Inc.|year=1986|edition=1|page=150|isbn=0-385-23120-2}}</ref><ref name=Fiegel207>{{cite book|last=Fiegel|first=Eddi|title=Dream a Little Dream of Me: The Life of Cass Elliot|publisher=Pan Books|year=2006|edition=1|page=207|isbn=0-330-48751-5}}</ref> Upon returning to the [[United States]], the group, their manager Bobby Roberts, their attorney Abe Somer, and their label [[Dunhill Records]] officially fired Michelle Phillips on Tuesday, June 28, 1966.<ref name=Hall103/><ref name=John148>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=John|title=Papa John: An Autobiography|publisher=Doubleday & Company Inc.|year=1986|edition=1|page=148|isbn=0-385-23120-2}}</ref><ref name=Greenwald135>{{cite book|last=Greenwald|first=Matthew|title=Go Where You Wanna Go: The Oral History of The Mamas and The Papas|publisher=Cooper Square Press|year=2002|edition=1|page=135|isbn=0-8154-1204-5}}</ref> Jill Gibson was hired two weeks earlier, just before the band left for England.\n\nBeginning in early July and continuing through part of August 1966, Gibson, Cass Elliot, Denny Doherty, John Phillips and Lou Adler recorded the band's second LP at [[United Western Recorders|Western Studios]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] with [[Bones Howe]] as the engineer.

After two years there, and a short stint in  New Mexico, she left for [[Florence, Italy]] in 1970. For the next five and a half years Gibson painted while living in the Tuscan hills, studying briefly at [[The Simi Studio]] in Florence before returning briefly to California in 1973. On that return visit Jill Gibson made her American debut as a painter where her art was showcased for the first time at the [[DeVorzon Gallery]] in [[Hollywood]] for a week, and such guests as [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Roman Polanski]], Lou Adler, and Michelle Phillips were in attendance.<ref>''Rolling Stone'', January 31, 1974, p. 24, Issue #153, \"Random Notes\"</ref> Lou Adler purchased an original Gibson painting for $450 at the time while Nicholson also purchased two originals.<ref>''Rolling Stone'', January 31, 1974, p.24, Issue #153, \"Random Notes\"</ref>\n\nJill Gibson's developing style as an artist is influenced by her interest in Renaissance art, nature, and the feminine. Many of her original art works are in the private collections of [[Max Factor]], [[Guy Webster (photographer)|Guy Webster]], [[Michael Savage (commentator)|Michael Savage]], [[The Seattle Museum]], [[Jack Nicholson]], and a fifteen-foot photo montage in [[The Los Angeles Free Clinic]].\n\nToday, Jill Gibson is a full-time artist with her own studio, Gibson Artworks, in [[Marin County, California|Marin]].

Web. 03 \nMar. 2015.</ref> Unlike some photographers who were interested in psychoanalyzing or exposing the queens, Goldin admired and respected their sexuality. Goldin said, \u201cMy desire was to show them as a third gender, as another sexual option, a gender option. And to show them with a lot of respect and love, to kind of glorify them because I really admire people who can recreate themselves and manifest their fantasies publicly.

There was one little chapter about it in an abnormal psych book that made it sound so\u2026 I don\u2019t know what they ascribed it to, but it was so bizarre. And that\u2019s where I was at that time in my life. I lived with them; it was my whole focus. Everything I did -- that\u2019s who I was all the time.

However, after she went to the school of Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, her professors told her to go back and photograph queens again, Goldin admitted her work was not the same as when she had lived with them. \nGoldin graduated from the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]/[[Tufts University]] in 1977/1978, where she had worked mostly with [[Cibachrome]] prints.

She began documenting the [[post-punk]] new-wave music scene, along with the city's vibrant, post-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] [[gay]] subculture of the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was drawn especially to the hard-drug subculture of the [[Bowery]] neighborhood; these photographs, taken between 1979 and 1986, form her famous work ''[[The Ballad of Sexual Dependency]]'' \u2014 a title taken from a song in [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[Threepenny Opera]]''.<ref>Brecht, Bertolt. \"Three Penny Opera.\" Act II, song 12.</ref> Published with help from [[Marvin Heiferman]], Mark Holborn, and Suzanne Fletcher, these [[snapshot aesthetic]] images depict drug use, violent, aggressive couples and autobiographical moments.

The main themes of her early pictures are love, gender, domesticity, and sexuality; these frames are usually shot with [[available light]]. She has affectionately documented women looking in mirrors, girls in bathrooms and barrooms, drag queens, sexual acts, and the culture of obsession and dependency. The images are viewed like a private journal made public.<ref>{{citation | title= Nan Goldin at Pa.

Goodwin's father, a factory owner in Montreal, died when she was 9. After graduating from high school, she studied design at Valentine's Commercial School of Art in Montreal, then launched her career as a painter and printmaker in the late 1940s. In the 1960s, she enrolled in a [[printmaking]] class with [[Yves Gaucher]] at [[Sir George Williams University]] in [[Montreal]]. Dissatisfied with her work, she destroyed most of it and in 1968 she limited herself to drawing.<ref name=\"Johnson, Brian D 1998\">Johnson, Brian D. \"Body Language.\" ''Maclean's'' Vol. 111, no. 48 (Nov. 30, 1998): 88-89.</ref> \nShe was married to Martin Goodwin, a civil engineer (d. 2008). Their son Paul died at 30 of a drug overdose.<ref name=\"Johnson, Brian D 1998\" />\n\n== Art ==\n\nBetty Goodwin used a large variety of media, including [[collage]], sculpture, printmaking, painting and drawing, assemblage and etchings. Her subject matter almost always revolves around the human form and deals with it in a highly emotional way.<ref name=\"Johnson, Brian D 1998\" /> Many of her ideas came from clusters of photographs, objects or drawings on the walls in her studio. She also used the \u201cgerm\u201d of ideas that are left after being erased from a work.<ref name=\"Johnson, Brian D 1998\" /> During the 1950's and 60's Goodwin painted still-lifes. She also depicted scenes of [[Jews in Montreal|Montreal's Jewish Community]]. She became interested in found objects, particularly how they represent traces of life. She created copper plate impressions of items of clothing to produce a series of [[etchings]], entitled ''Vest,'' which gained international attention. Goodwin created a series of wall hangings entitled ''Tarpaulin'' from 1972-`974, which she reworked to shape into sculptures and collages. Over a period of six years beginning in 1982, Goodwin explored the human form in her drawing series ''Swimmers,'' this project used graphite, oil pastels and charcoal on translucent Mylar. The large-scale drawings depict solitary floating or sinking bodies, suspended in space. In 1986, to show the interaction of human figures she created her series ''Carbon'' using charcoal and wax to create drawings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betty Goodwin|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=2098|website=www.gallery.ca|publisher=National Gallery of Canada|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Other Notable Artworks'''\n*1979: ''Rue Mentana''\n*1985: ''Moving Towards Fire''\n*1988-89: ''Steel Note''\n*1990-95: ''La Memoire du corps series'' (Memory of the Body)\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\n'''Solo Exhibitions'''<ref name=Artnet>{{cite web|title=Betty Roodish Goodwin Biography|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/betty-roodish-goodwin/biography|website=Artnet.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n2002\n*The Prints of Betty Goodwin, National Gallery of Canada; Ottawa\n*Recent Works, Jack Shainman Gallery; New York\n1999\n*Galerie Rene Blouin; Montreal\n1998\n*The Art of Betty Goodwin, Art Gallery of Ontario; Toronto\n\n'''Group Exhibitions'''<ref name=Artnet />\n\n2000\n*Old Bodies, Oakville Galleries; Oakville, Ontario\n*Betty Goodwin, Jack Shainman Gallery; New York, New York\n1999\n*Cosmos, Musee des beaux-arts de Montreal; Montreal, Quebec\n1997\n*Sable-Castelli Gallery; Toronto, Ontario\n1996\n*Stephen Friedman Gallery; London\n*Betty Goodwin: Signs of Life, The National Gallery of Canada; Ottawa\n1994\n*La Ferme Du Buisson, Centre d\u2019art contemporian; Noisiel, France\n1993\n*Fawbush Gallery; New York, New York\n*Les Femmeuses 92, Pratt et Whitney Canada; Montreal, Quebec\n1991\n*Betty Goodwin, Espacc la Tranchefile; Montreal\n1990\n*Galerie Rene Blouin; Montreal, Ontario\n1986\n*Installations-Fictions, Galerie Graff; Montreal, Quebec\n1985\n*Sable-Castelli Gallery; Toronto, Ontario\n1976\n*Betty Goodwin 1969-76, Musee d\u2019art contemporian; Montreal, Quebec\n1974\n*Spanish International Biennial Exhibition of Fine Prints; Segovia, Spain\n1973\n*Galerie B Montreal\n1967\n*Burnaby Print Show, Burnaby Art Gallery; Vancouver, BC\n1962\n*Penthouse Gallery, Crown Life Insurance; Montreal\n1955\n*Pring Exhibition, Musee des Beaux-Arts de Montreal; Montreal, Quebec\n\n== Career highlights ==\n\nGoodwin's work has been exhibited in Montreal since the early 60s, with some significant solo shows.

We would have 'super versions' and 'hyper versions' of Soldiers, Clerics, Wizards, Zombies, Goblins, Elves, etc. Even the land would evolve over the course of Onslaught block.

She has taken part in various British exhibitions, including in the [[Royal Festival Hall]]. She is a member of the [[Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World]] (AMFPA).

She began her professional career as a fashion model in the mid-1960s and went on to model for [[Paco Rabanne]] and [[Ossie Clark]] among others. Around that time she met the Spanish surrealist painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and would remain his closest friend and [[muse]] for the next 15 years. Lear first came into the public eye as the cover model for [[Roxy Music]]'s album ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'' in 1973. From the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, she was a million-album-selling [[disco]] queen, mainly in [[Continental Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]], signed to [[Ariola Records]]. Lear's first four albums earned her mainstream popularity, charting in the Top 10 on European charts, including the best-selling ''[[Sweet Revenge (Amanda Lear album)|Sweet Revenge]]'' (1978). Her biggest hits included \"[[Blood and Honey]]\", \"[[Tomorrow (Amanda Lear song)|Tomorrow]]\", \"[[Queen of Chinatown]]\", \"[[Follow Me (Amanda Lear song)|Follow Me]]\", \"[[Enigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me)]]\" and \"[[Fashion Pack]]\".\n\nIn the mid-1980s Lear positioned herself as one of the leading media personalities in mainland Europe, especially in Italy and in France where she hosted many popular TV shows. She had also developed a successful painting career, regularly exhibiting her works in galleries across Europe for the next three decades,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eventiesagre.it/Eventi_Mostre/18010_Sogni+Miti+Colori.html |title=Eventi Mostre.

Amanda's 1980s musical output saw her experimenting with different genres and trying to revive her career by re-recording earlier hits to various levels of success. 1980s also saw her release two books: an autobiography ''[[My Life with Dal\u00ed]]'' and a novel ''L'Immortelle''.\n\nSince the 1990s her time has been divided between music, television, movies and painting. Despite frequent album releases, she failed to achieve success on charts with her music. However, her television career remained successful, with Lear hosting numerous prime time TV shows, occasionally making guest appearances in French and Italian TV series. She has also performed acting and dubbing roles in independent as well as major film productions. In the late 2000s Lear would reinvent herself as a theatrical actress, performing in long-running stage plays in France. To date, she has sold over 25 million singles and 15 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spinner.com/2009/03/27/twisted-tales-the-transgender-mystery-of-international-pop-diva/ |title=Twisted Tales: The Transgender Mystery of International Pop Diva Amanda Lear |author=James Sullivan |date=27 March 2009 |work=[[Spinner (website)|Spinner]] |publisher=www.spinner.com |accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> Lear is also a widely recognized [[gay icon]].\n\n==Early life==\nLear's origins are unclear, with the singer herself providing different information about her background and keeping her birth year a secret even from her long-term husband.<ref name=\"www.telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4721185/Why-would-I-want-to-kill-my-husband.html |title='Why would I want to kill my husband?' |author=Christa D'Souza |date=23 January 2001 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=www.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref> Contested facts include her birth date and place, her birth gender, names and nationalities of her parents, and the location of her upbringing.

A French-language version of the track, \"[[La Bagarre]]\", was released on [[Polydor]] in France and while equally unsuccessful there, it became a minor disco hit in West Germany in early 1976. The track caught the attention of the singer, composer and producer [[Anthony Monn]] and label [[Ariola Records|Ariola]], which offered her a seven-year, six-album recording contract for a sum of money that Lear since has described as \"astronomic\".<ref name=\"eurodancehits.com\"/> Her debut album, ''[[I Am a Photograph]]'', released in 1977, was recorded in Munich with most songs composed by Monn. Lear, along with arrangers [[Rainer Pietsch]] and [[Charly Ricanek]], wrote all the English lyrics.

''I Am a Photograph'''s mixture of lush disco, [[schlager music|schlager]], [[kitsch]] and [[camp (style)|camp]], topped with Lear's deep half-spoken, half-sung vocals and her characteristic [[Franglais]] accent was a successful combination.

The first single from ''Sweet Revenge'', \"[[Follow Me (Amanda Lear song)|Follow Me]]\", powered by Lear's characteristic deep and recitative voice and the theme of the devil, was an instant smash hit.

Lear took part in three Italian productions in 1978: a war-time parody ''[[Zio Adolfo in arte F\u00fchrer]]'', a [[softcore pornography|softporn]] documentary movie ''[[Follie di notte]]'', directed by [[Joe D'Amato]], and a six-episode controversial TV show ''[[Stryx]]''. Later in 1978 Lear and Monn teamed up for ''[[Never Trust a Pretty Face]]''. The album featured a variety of genre exercises like the dance version of a war-time classic \"[[Lili Marleen]]\", the interpersonal ballad \"[[The Sphinx (song)|The Sphinx]]\", the cabaret-esque \"Miroir\", futuristic tracks \"Black Holes\" and \"Intellectually\", as well as the hit disco single \"[[Fashion Pack|Fashion Pack (Studio 54)]]\". In 1979, Amanda had her first art exhibition in Paris<ref name=\"night\"/> and on 13 March in Las Vegas married bisexual French aristocrat [[Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Vill\u00e8le]], the former lover and then adopted son of a diplomat and controversial gay novelist [[Roger Peyrefitte]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/peyrefitte_r.html |title=Peyrefitte, Roger |author=Michael D. Sibalis |work=[[glbtq.com]] |publisher=www.glbtq.com |accessdate=18 July 2007}}</ref> The couple had first met late in 1978 at a fashionable Parisian discoth\u00e8que [[Le Palace]], a French equivalent of [[Studio 54]]. Dal\u00ed and his wife [[Gala Dal\u00ed|Gala]] both strongly disapproved of this relationship and even attempted to persuade Lear to have the marriage annulled. As a consequence of this, and also the time taken up by Lear's successful career in music and television, she and her mentor began drifting apart. They still sporadically kept in touch via letters and telephone through the early and mid-1980s, especially after Gala's death in 1982. Lear visited Dal\u00ed one last time at [[P\u00fabol]], Spain a few years before the painter himself died.\nIn late 1979, Lear recorded ''[[Diamonds for Breakfast]]'', which was her commercial breakthrough on the Scandinavian market (No. 4 in Sweden<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Amanda+Lear&titel=Diamonds+For+Breakfast&cat=a |title=Amanda Lear \u2013 Diamonds For Breakfast |publisher=www.swedishcharts.com |accessdate=10 April 2009 }}</ref> and No. 10 in Norway<ref>{{cite web |url=http://norwegiancharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Amanda+Lear&titel=Diamonds+For+Breakfast&cat=a |title=Amanda Lear \u2013 Diamonds For Breakfast |publisher=norwegiancharts.com |accessdate=10 April 2009}}</ref>), producing hits \"[[Fabulous (Lover, Love Me)]]\" and \"[[Diamonds (Amanda Lear song)|Diamonds]]\", plus regional single releases \"[[When (Amanda Lear song)|When]]\", \"Japan\" and the [[autoeroticism|autoerotic]] \"Ho fatto l'amore con me\". The album abandoned the Munich disco sound with its lush strings and brass arrangements in favour of an electronic [[New wave music|new wave]] rock style. Lear spent most of 1980 on European promotional tours for the album and its many accompanying single releases, from Greece to Finland. She also made her first visit to Japan, where both the single \"Queen of Chinatown\" and the ''Sweet Revenge'' album had topped the charts and were awarded with gold certifications. Two non-album singles followed the ''Diamonds for Breakfast'' album in late 1980: a pop cover of [[Eric \"Monty\" Morris]]'s early [[ska]] hit \"[[Solomon Gundie]]\" and the [[chanson]]-esque \"Le Chat de goutti\u00e8re\", the latter with both music and lyrics written by Lear and recorded for [[French language|francophone]] markets.\n\nThe Lear/Monn album success saga neared its end in 1981, when Lear had become increasingly uncomfortable with the expectations and pressures of the music business in general and her own record label in particular. At the artistic and commercial peak of her international career, but with the so-called \"[[Disco#Backlash and decline|anti-disco backlash]]\" beginning to take its toll, she had tentatively started recording tracks for a forthcoming album with producer [[Trevor Horn]] in London. However, Ariola did not approve the material<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trevor-horn.de/revealed.html |title=Trevor Horn Worship Hall |author=Wouter Weylandt |publisher=www.trevor-horn.de |accessdate=10 April 2009}}</ref> and informed Lear that she was to return to Munich and provide the company and the market with another Monn product. The result of these sessions was ''[[Incognito (Amanda Lear album)|Incognito]]'', only partly co-written by Lear, with New Wave material fuelled with rock and electronic elements. ''Incognito'' generated minor European hits: \"[[Nymphomania (song)|Nymphomania]]\", \"[[Red Tape (song)|Red Tape]]\" and the French language ballad \"[[\u00c9gal]]\", and still met with relative success in Scandinavia. It was also her breakthrough album in South America, with three tracks recorded in Spanish: \"Igual\", \"Dama de Berlin\" and \"Ninfoman\u00eda\". Another non-album single followed in early 1982, a [[synthpop]] take on pop classic \"[[Fever (Little Willie John song)|Fever]]\". This would be Lear's final collaboration with producer Anthony Monn. Shortly thereafter she took legal action against the Ariola label on the grounds of artistic differences to be released from her recording contract. The lawsuit was unsuccessful and she remained with Ariola until the end of 1983, as stipulated in the original contract. In 1982 another Italian language single, the ballad \"[[Incredibilmente donna]]\", was released on the greatest hits compilation ''[[Ieri, oggi]]''.\n\nThe double A-side single \"[[Love Your Body]]\"/\"Darkness and Light\", released in the spring of 1983, was produced by Monn's sound engineer Peter L\u00fcdermann rather than Monn himself. These were Lear's final Munich recordings for Ariola and her final promotional appearance on West Germany's most important music TV show at the time, ''[[Musikladen]]'', in June 1983. Lear's international career momentum was slowing and effectively came to an end in December 1983 with her sixth and final Ariola album under contractual obligation. ''[[Tam-Tam (Amanda Lear album)|Tam-Tam]]'', a collaboration with Italian composers and producers, was a modern and minimalist early 1980s synthpop album with a soundscape dominated by [[Roland TR-808]] drum machines and sequencer-programmed synthesizers. Lear again wrote all the English lyrics for the album. Although she performed some of the songs from the album on the Italian TV show ''Premiatissima'', she did not promote ''Tam-Tam'' in West Germany or any other parts of Europe and neither did the record company. As a consequence, ''Tam-Tam'' passed by unnoticed by the international record-buying public.\n\n===1983\u20131999: Television career and comeback attempts===\nLear went on to launch a very successful and lucrative career as a TV presenter with future prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], soon becoming something of a household name in Italy. She hosted many successful TV shows there, including ''Premiatissima'' and ''W le donne'' (adapted in France in the early 1990s as ''Cherchez la femme''). The singer also recorded a string of dance singles for various European labels: \"[[Assassino]]\" and \"[[Ritmo Salsa]]\" in 1984, followed by \"[[No Credit Card]]\" and \"[[Women (Amanda Lear song)|Women]]\" in 1985. A [[extended play|minialbum]] entitled ''[[A L]]'', with four covers of classic songs, including [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s \"Bye Bye Baby\" and \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]] from the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', was recorded for Five Records and released in 1985. At the end of 1985, Lear appeared in a series of TV spots for [[Fiat]], advertising their Christmas promotion.\n\nAfter four years as a TV entertainer in Italy on [[Canale 5]] and France on [[La Cinq]], Lear returned to music. ''[[Secret Passion]]'', a post-disco [[Hi-NRG]]-New Wave affair produced by [[Christian de Walden]], was recorded in Los Angeles and Rome for a major French label [[Carrere Records]]. The album was to be her comeback in Continental Europe, Scandinavia, the Eastern Bloc, South America and Japan, as well as a breakthrough attempt in [[Anglosphere|anglophone]] countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States, Canada and Australasia. These were the only major markets that Lear had not conquered during the Ariola years. The launch was planned for January 1987, however, just before promotion began, Lear was seriously injured in a near-fatal car accident and took months to recover. ''Secret Passion'''s commercial success was less than hoped for, and the lead single \"[[Wild Thing (Chip Taylor song)#Amanda Lear version|Wild Thing]]\" was ultimately only released in a few countries such as France, Italy and Greece. The accident was nonetheless a starting point for another phase in her career, this time as a writer. While in the hospital, Lear began writing her first novel, ''L'Immortelle'', a surrealistic tale of the torments of a woman doomed to eternal youth and beauty.<ref name=\"tanzhouse\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEkciZA9uA |title=Amanda Lear \u2013 Interview at \"Tanzhouse\" |year=1989 |work=Tanzhouse |publisher=www.youtube.com |language=English, German |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> Watching everyone else grow older and eventually losing all her loved ones, the woman is still as beautiful but unable to stop the merciless passage of time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lear |first=Amanda |title=L'Immortelle |year=1987 |publisher=Carrere France |location= |language=French |isbn=0-393-04624-9 |pages=367}}</ref>\n[[File:Amanda Lear.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Amanda Lear at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1990]]\nA series of re-recordings of her old hits appeared on the market in the late 1980s, starting with a synthpop version of the biggest hit, \"Follow Me\", in 1987. The following year Italian band [[CCCP Fedeli alla linea]] recorded a cover of her song \"Tomorrow\", newly called \"[[Tomorrow (Voulez-vous un rendez-vous)]]\", for which Lear contributed guest vocals. The single was a minor hit in Italy and Amanda's first chart success in that country in six years. In 1989 DJ [[Ian Levine]] remixed \"Follow Me\" and \"Gold\" in a Hi-NRG fashion, while Lear hosted ''Ars Amanda'' on [[Rai 3]], an Italian chat show where she interviewed both Italian and international celebrities and politicians in a bed.<ref name=\"eurodancehits.com\"/> From the late 1980s, Lear has been a regular participant in the popular French radio show ''[[Les Grosses T\u00eates]]'' on [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]], televised on [[Paris Premi\u00e8re]].

The same year Amanda re-recorded some of the songs in French and cut a new dance single, \"[[M\u00e9tamorphose (song)|M\u00e9tamorphose]]\", for a French-Italian re-release of the album, called ''[[Tant qu'il y aura des hommes]]''. In 1990, released a new up-tempo promotional-only single, \"Do You Remember Me?\", and took part in [[Thierry Mugler]]'s fashion show.\n\nAmanda continued to record more dancefloor-friendly repertoire in the 1990s, with the 1992 song \"[[Fantasy (Amanda Lear song)|Fantasy]]\", which became a hit in clubs around Europe, especially gay. ''[[Cadavrexquis]]'', her next album, released in 1993, featured heavily club-oriented material, including \"Fantasy\" and re-recordings of three songs from the disco era. Both the single and the album failed to enter any mainstream charts. Meanwhile, Lear appeared in [[Arnaud S\u00e9lignac]]'s TV drama ''Une Femme pour moi'', and then modeled for the fashion house [[Gr\u00e8s]] in Paris in 1994 and again for Thierry Mugler in Berlin in 1995. In May 1995 Lear debuted her new, erotic late night TV show ''Peep!'' in Germany, also known as ''Beware of the Blondes'', which she would host for one year, before adapting it in France on [[TF1]] under the title ''M\u00e9fiez-vous des blondes''. The show, which used her new song \"[[Peep!]]\" as the opening music theme, became remarkably popular in Germany, achieving over 50% of market share,<ref name=\"eurodancehits.com\"/> but was quickly cancelled in France. In June 1995, she performed during a tribute concert to the 1970s disco music. In November, the singer released the album ''[[Alter Ego (Amanda Lear album)|Alter Ego]]'', an upbeat [[eurodance]] offering. The album again was not successful and did not produce any elusive international comeback hit, with singles \"Everytime You Touch Me\", \"Peep!\" and \"Angel Love\" failing to enter music charts. As an active supporter of people suffering from [[HIV/AIDS]], in 1996 Lear made an appearance as a model for Paco Rabanne during an annual charity event [[Life Ball]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurodancehits.com/learphoto.html |title=Amanda Lear - PHOTO HISTORY |publisher=www.eurodancehits.com |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> During her concert at Le Palace in Paris in November 1996, the singer announced her definitive departure from touring and performing live, and although she would sporadically still give concerts in the following years, her live acts have limited mostly to short TV appearances ever since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurodancehits.com/learnews.html |title=Amanda Lear - NEWS |publisher=www.eurodancehits.com |accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAmanda released ''[[Back in Your Arms]]'' in spring 1998, an album consisting of re-recorded 1970s disco hits and remixed versions of tracks from the 1995 album ''Alter Ego''. The album failed to make much impact on the market, but the re-recordings have since been featured on many mid-price compilations in Europe. ''Back in Your Arms'' was soon re-released with a slightly different track list and title, and a new remix of \"Blood and Honey\" was released on a single. Her next acting and television ventures were a French movie ''Bimboland'', in which she starred alongside [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], and an Italian [[makeover reality television series|makeover TV show]] ''Il Brutto Anatroccolo''. On the set of ''Il Brutto Anatroccolo'' Lear met male model and actor [[Manuel Casella]], some thirty years her junior. Lear and Casella began a long-term relationship and were featured prominently in the tabloid press in both France and Italy, before splitting in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gay.it/channel/gossip/24204/Amanda-Lear-Manuel-adieu.html |title=Amanda Lear: Manuel adieu |date=25 February 2008 |publisher=www.gay.it |language=Italian |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u2013present: Recent career===\nLear contributed vocals for a cover of [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s 1970s hit \"[[From Here to Eternity (Giorgio Moroder song)|From Here to Eternity]]\", recorded in 2000 with [[Eric D.

The album offered club-friendly tracks like \"[[I Just Wanna Dance Again]]\" and a cover of \"[[Love Boat (song)|Love Boat]]\", the title song from a cult 1970s [[The Love Boat|TV series of the same name]], both issued as singles and featuring remixes by some prominent names in the world of French dance music such as [[Laurent Wolf]] and [[Junior Vasquez]]. Containing new dance-oriented tracks as well as ballads and a number of cover versions, ''Heart'' was greeted as a long overdue return to form.\n\nIn 2002 Lear starred in ''Le D\u00e9fi'' (''Dance Challenge''),<ref>http://www.parisvoice.com/voicearchives/02/june/html/dance.html  Blanca Li\u2019s Hip hop challenge by Carol Pratl</ref> a musical movie written and directed by choreographer [[Blanca Li]] about an eighteen-year-old dropout who dreams of becoming a star in [[B-boying|breakdancing]] and the ensuing conflicts with his conservative mother. Lear played the mother's understanding and encouraging best friend and a [[fashion victim]], what gave her an opportunity to demonstrate her comedic talent. She also cut a title song for an Italian TV show ''Cocktail d'amore'' which she hosted at that time and released a single \"[[Beats of Love#Get Ready! & Amanda Lear version|Beats of Love]]\" with a Belgian boy band Get Ready!, which became a minor chart success. Both tracks were included on a re-release of ''Heart'', newly titled ''[[Tendance]]'', in 2003. Next year Lear worked on a [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] for French and Italian versions of a [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s blockbuster ''[[The Incredibles]]'', while her 1978 song \"Enigma\" enjoyed a massive success in Central and Eastern Europe after being featured in a [[Kinder Bueno]] TV advert. In 2005 the singer became a judge on ''Ballando con le stelle'', the Italian version of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', and released two new dance singles, \"[[Paris by Night (song)|Paris by Night]]\" and a remake of [[Barry Manilow]]'s \"[[Copacabana (song)|Copacabana]]\", as well as two compilations, ''[[Forever Glam!]]'' and ''[[Sings Evergreens]]''. In 2006 Lear opened another art exhibition in New York, ''Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's Amanda Lear'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oneartworld.com/Envoy/Never+Mind+The+Bollocks_2C+Here_27s+Amanda+Lear.html |title=Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's Amanda Lear at Envoy |publisher=oneartworld.com |accessdate=9 April 2009}}</ref> and in July was decorated with the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French Minister of Culture [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]] in recognition of her contributions to French arts and sciences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/artsetlettres/juillet2006.html |title=Nominations dans l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres de juillet 2006 |publisher=www.culture.gouv.fr |language=French |accessdate=6 June 2010}}</ref> A new compilation was released, the 3 CD ''[[The Sphinx \u2013 Das Beste aus den Jahren 1976\u20131983]]'', fully covering the singer's Ariola output. In October, the album ''[[With Love (Amanda Lear album)|With Love]]'' was released in France, and consisted of covered evergreens and jazz standards by Amanda's favourite divas, such as [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Sarah Vaughan]] and [[Nina Simone]]. ''With Love'' won critical acclaim in France and was released in the rest of Europe in early 2007. Lear made several appearances in movies, including acting in ''[[Oliviero Rising]]'' and dubbing for the French version of ''[[Dragon Hunters (film)|Dragon Hunters]]'', and hosted television shows such as ''La Folle Histoire du Disco'' in France and ''Battaglia fra Sexy Star'' in Italy.\n[[File:Amanda Lear 2010 a.jpg|thumb|right|Amanda Lear in 2010]]\nIn 2009, Amanda reinvented herself as a stage actress, accepting the part of C\u00e9cile in a comedy ''Panique au minist\u00e8re'', which debuted in [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte Saint-Martin]] in Paris. The show was so successful that it was taken on tour and has been broadcast live on French TV. Her next album, ''[[Brief Encounters]]'', was released in autumn 2009, preceded by the single \"[[Someone Else's Eyes]]\", a duet with Italian singer-producer Deadstar. The album consisted of two discs, with down-tempo songs and ballads on the first one, and a set of dance tracks and remixes on the other. Next month, Lear released an autobiography ''Je ne suis pas celle que vous croyez...'' and an EP ''[[Brand New Love Affair (EP)|Brand New Love Affair]]'', this time featuring purely dance-oriented material. The title song was released as the lead single, with an animated music video. The ''Brief Encounters'' album was partly re-recorded and remixed, and subsequently released in ''Acoustique'' and ''Reloaded'' versions. [[Boy George]] remixed \"Someone Else's Eyes\" in 2010, which was followed by a single \"[[I'm Coming Up]]\".\n\nIn April 2011 a new single, \"[[Chinese Walk]]\", was released, and the singer joined the judging panel of the Italian TV show ''Ciak... si canta!'' on [[Rai Uno]]. In September Lear returned to theatre for the lead role in ''Lady Oscar'', an adaptation of [[Claude Magnier]]'s 1958 play ''Oscar'', at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance]] in Paris. The play turned out another success and would run for over a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billetreduc.com/80958/evt.htm |title=Lady Oscar avec Amanda Lear - Centre culturel Jacques Pr\u00e9vert |publisher=www.billetreduc.com |language=French |accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> Her next studio album, ''[[I Don't Like Disco]]'', was released in January 2012, accompanied by another single, \"[[La Bete et la Belle]]\", and promoted by several TV appearances in France.

Her parents returned to Europe when she was four years of age to live in Ireland and in London, where she subsequently attended the Chelsea School of Arts and Crafts. During this period she was impressed by an important exhibition of American painting at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]], particularly by the works of [[Sam Francis]] and [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]]. It was [[Abstract Expressionism]] that opened up new possibilities of experimentation for her at that time. She later met these artists in Paris along with [[Joan Mitchell]] and others with whom she exchanged works. The techniques employed included palette knife and paint flows and soon involved the use of multiple canvases as a means of creating pictorial interactions.\n\nShe began to exhibit in group shows in London and Dublin from the age of 18. [[The Burren]] and her love of lonely places informed these early paintings. Her work was then interrupted for three years by a series of operations on her spine. During that time she met the painter [[Louis le Brocquy]] who was then working in London. They married in 1958 and set up house and studio in the south of France, where two sons were born to them, Alexis and Pierre.\n\n==1960s\u2013present==\nthe mid sixties on, their comparatively reclusive life in Carros village was changed by the opening of the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul, where over the years they were constantly meeting painters, sculptors, writers, poets, and musicians forming friendships resumed in Paris and elsewhere. In 1965 Anne Madden represented Ireland at the Paris Biennale, before regularly exhibiting in that city. From the 1960s she began to paint a series of abstract landscapes influenced by her time as a young girl in the west of Ireland, near the Burren in Co. Clare. Between 1970 and 1979 Madden painted a large series of vertical works, their size determined by her height and reach. Reflecting on life and death, the works derived from megaliths and other prehistoric monuments. In the 1980s Madden stopped painting for a time and devoted herself to drawing, this resulted in a series of large works in graphite and oil paint on paper entitled Openings, which formed the exhibition of her work at the Fondation Maeght, in 1983 and represented her in ROSC '84. Madden then returned to painting on canvas and has continued to develop and produce a large body of work. She returned to painting on canvas and developed a large body of work which was included in a retrospective, sponsored by the Arts Council in 1991, and exhibited in the R.H.A. Gallagher Galleries, Dublin. She has exhibited widely in both solo and group exhibitions and her work is represented in many public collections.\n\nHer book ''Louis le Brocquy, Seeing His Way'' was published in 1993 (Gill & Macmillan). A year later she received an important commission from Dr. Ronald Tallon, architect of the O'Reilly Hall at U.C.D., to paint one of the ten large paintings displayed within the Aula Maxima. In 1999 the hillside village of Carros in the south of France commissioned Anne Madden to paint a large vaulted ceiling painting measuring 900 \u00d7 600&nbsp;cm for its medieval castle, which opened last year as an international contemporary art centre. The artist produced Empyrius in her nearby studio before it was mounted in situ as a permanent installation.

The controversy on its release was intense, including accusations of [[child pornography]] (both in America<ref>\u201cPhoto Book Challenged as Indecent\u201d, \u2018\u2019The Post-Tribune\u2019\u2019 (Merrillville IN), December 18, 1997.</ref> and abroad<ref>\"Sally Mann\u2019s photographs lead to request for police investigation\" ''Helsingin Sanomat'', Helsinki, Finland [http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Sally+Mann%E2%80%99s+photographs+lead+to+request+for+police+investigation+/1135232200901 Helsingin Sanomat - International Edition - Culture]</ref>) and of contrived fiction with constructed tableaux.<ref name= NYTD />\n\n[[File:\"Virginia at Four\" by Sally Mann (1989).jpg|thumb|left|\"Virginia at Four\" by Sally Mann (1989)]]\n\nNegative criticism of Mann's works is not hard to find. One of her detractors, [[Pat Robertson]] of the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], has said that \u201cselling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it\u2019s wrong.\u201d<ref name=\"cantor1993\">{{cite book|last=Cantor|first=Steven|title=Blood Ties: The Life and Work of Sally Mann|year=1993|publisher=Stick Figure Productions|location=New York}}</ref> He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov\u2019s article ''Critique: Censoring Virginia''<ref>\u2019\u2019The Wall Street Journal\u2019\u2019, February 6, 1991. \u201cCritique: Censoring Virginia,\u201d By Ray Sokolov, p A10.</ref> in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (''Virginia at 4''), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission \u201cto illustrate that this is the kind of thing that shouldn\u2019t be shown.\u201d<ref name=\"cantor1993\"/> She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She wrote a letter to the author saying \u201cDear Sir, I don\u2019t like the way you crossed me out.\u201d Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d<ref name=\"cantor1993\"/> It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh criticism of these photographs, for she did not stage these moments \u2014 instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.<ref name=\"art21\" />\n\n[[File:\"The Perfect Tomato\" by Sally Mann (1990) (correct image).jpg|thumb|right|\"The Perfect Tomato\" by Sally Mann (1990)]]\n\nMany of her other photographs containing her nude or hurt children caused controversy. For example, in \"The Perfect Tomato,\"  the viewer sees a nude Jessie, posing on a picnic table outside, bathed in light. Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming of one of his movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, and she tried to capture the image in a rush because the sun was setting. This explains why everything is blurred except for the tomato, hence the photograph's title.<ref name=\"cantor1993\"/> This image was likely criticized for Jessie\u2019s nudity and presentation of the adolescent female form. While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann\u2019s children were often naked because \u201cit came natural to them.\u201d<ref name=\"americansuburbx1\">{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Dana|title=Sally Mann|url=http://www.americansuburbx.com/2009/11/theory-sally-mann-by-dana-cox.html|newspaper=American Suburb X}}</ref> This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she used to walk around her house naked when she was growing up. Cox states that \u201cthe own artist\u2019s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children\u2019s lives.\u201d<ref name=\"americansuburbx1\"/> One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides \"naked play\", ''Jessie's Cut'', shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye. The cut is stitched and the blood is dry and stains her skin. As painful as the image looks, there are a great number of viewers who could relate to Jessie when they think about the broken bones and stitched up cuts they had during childhood.\n\n[[File:\"Jessie's Cut\" by Sally Mann (1985).jpg|thumb|left|\"Jessie's Cut\" by Sally Mann (1985)]]\n\nMann herself considered these photographs to be \u201cnatural through the eyes of a mother, since she has seen her children in every state: happy, sad, playful, sick, bloodied, angry and ''even'' naked.\u201d<ref>Photographers and photography. \"''Sally Mann: Mother and American Photographer''\"[http://www.photographers-and-photography.com/articles/photographers/famous-photographers-1950-present/sally-mann.php]  {{wayback|url=http://www.photographers-and-photography.com/articles/photographers/famous-photographers-1950-present/sally-mann.php |date=20090222185338 }}</ref> Critics agreed, saying her \u201cvision in large measure [is] accurate, and a welcome corrective to familiar notions of youth as a time of unalloyed sweetness and innocence,\u201d<ref>Charles Hagen, \u201cReview/Art; Childhood Without Sweetness.\u201d The New York Times, June 5, 1992.

Before she published ''[[Immediate Family (book)|Immediate Family]],'' she consulted a Virginian Federal prosecutor who told her that some of the images she was exhibiting could have her arrested. She decided to postpone the publication of the book in 1991.

Each child was then allowed to vote on which photographs were to be put in the book. To further protect the children from \u201cteasing,\u201d<ref name=\"woodward32\"/> Mann told Woodward that she wanted to keep copies of ''[[Immediate Family (book)|Immediate Family]]'' out of their home town of Lexington. She asked bookstores in the area not to sell it and for libraries to keep it in their rare-book rooms.<ref name=\"woodward32\"/> Dr. Aaron Esman, a child psychiatrist at the Payne Whitney Clinic believes that Mann is serious about her work and that she has \u201cno intention to jeopardize her children or use them for pornographic images.\u201d<ref name=\"cantor1993\"/> He says that the nude photographs don\u2019t appear to be erotically stimulating to anyone but a \u201ccase-hardened pedophile or a rather dogmatic religious fundamentalist.\u201d<ref name=\"cantor1993\"/> Mann states, \"I didn't expect the controversy over the pictures of my children.

The 60 images included more photographs of her children, but also earlier landscapes with color and abstract photographs.\n\n==Later career==\nIn the mid-1990s, Mann began photographing landscapes on wet plate collodion 8x10 glass negatives, and again used the same 100-year-old 8 x 10 bellows view camera that she had used for all the previous bodies of work. These landscapes were first seen in ''Still Time'', and later featured in two shows presented by the [[Edwynn Houk Gallery]] in NYC: ''Sally Mann \u2013 Mother Land: Recent Landscapes of Georgia and Virginia'' in 1997, and then in ''Deep South: Landscapes of Louisiana and Mississippi'' in 1999. Many of these large (40\"x50\") black-and-white and manipulated prints were taken using the 19th century \u201cwet plate\u201d process, or [[collodion]], in which glass plates are coated with collodion, dipped in [[silver nitrate]], and exposed while still wet. This gave the photographs what the ''New York Times'' called \u201ca swirling, ethereal image with a center of preternatural clarity,\"<ref>Lyle Rexer, \"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E3DF163BF93AA25752C1A9669C8B63 Art/Architecture: Marriage Under Glass: Intimate Exposures]\", ''New York Times'', November 19, 2000.</ref> and showed many flaws and artifacts, some from the process and some introduced by Mann.\n\nMann\u2019s fifth book, ''[[What Remains (book)|What Remains]]'', published in 2003, is based on the show of the same name at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art|Corcoran Gallery]] in Washington, DC and is in five parts. The first section contains photographs of the remains of Eva, her [[greyhound]], after decomposition. The second part has the photographs of dead and decomposing bodies at a federal [[Forensic]] [[Anthropology]] Facility (known as the \u2018body farm\u2019). The third part details the site on her property where an armed escaped convict was killed. The fourth part is a study of the grounds of [[Antietam]], the site of the bloodiest single day battle in American history during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The last part is a study of close-ups of the faces of her children. Thus, this study of mortality, decay and death ends with hope and love.<ref>Malcolm Jones, \"[http://www.newsweek.com/id/60003 Love, Death, Light]\", ''Newsweek'', September 8, 2003.  {{wayback|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/60003 |date=20071109201627 }}</ref>\n\nMann\u2019s sixth book, ''Deep South'', published in 2005, with 65 black-and-white images, includes landscapes taken from 1992 to 2004 using both conventional 8x10 film and wet plate collodion. These photographs have been described as \u201chaunted landscapes of the south, battlefields, decaying mansion, [[kudzu]] shrouded landscapes and the site where [[Emmett Till]] was murdered.\"<ref name=\"newsw\">Malcolm Jones, \"[http://www.newsweek.com/id/51141 Look Books]\", ''Newsweek'', November 25, 2005 {{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' picked it as their book choice for the holiday season, saying that Mann \u201cwalks right up to every [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[stereotype]] in the book and subtly demolishes each in its turn by creating indelibly disturbing images that hover somewhere between document and dream.\"<ref name=newsw />\n\nMann's seventh book, ''Proud Flesh'', published in 2009, is a study taken over six years of the effects of [[muscular dystrophy]] on her husband Larry Mann. As Mann notes, \"The results of this rare reversal of photographic roles are candid, extraordinarily wrenching and touchingly frank portraits of a man at his most vulnerable moment.\"<ref name=\"extended-bio\" /> The project was displayed in [[Gagosian Gallery]] in October 2009.\n\nMann's eighth book, ''The Flesh and The Spirit'', published in 2010, was released in conjunction with a comprehensive show at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vmfa.state.va.us/Exhibitions/Sally-Mann-The-Flesh-and-The-Spirit/ | title=Sally Mann: The Flesh And The Spirit | publisher=[[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] | accessdate=11 November 2010 }}</ref> Regarding this exhibition, Virginia's Museum director states, \"She follows her own voice.

Its unifying theme is the body, with its vagaries of illnesses and death, and includes essays by John Ravenal, David Levi Strauss and [[Anne Wilkes Tucker]].\n\nMann's ninth book, ''Hold Still: A Memoir with Photographs'', released May 12, 2015, is a melding of a memoir of her youth, an examination of some major influences of her life, and reflections on how photography shapes our view of the world. It is augmented with photographs, letters, and other memorabilia. She singles out her \"near-feral\" childhood and her subsequent introduction to photography at Putney, her relationship to her husband of 40 years and his parent's mysterious death, and her maternal Welsh relative's nostalgia for land morphing into her love for her land in the Shenandoah Valley as some of her important influences. Gee-Gee, a black woman who was a surrogate parent, who opened Mann's eyes to race relations and exploitation, her relationship with [[Cy Twombly]], and her father's genteel southern legacy and his eventual death are also examined. [[The New York Times]] describes it as \"an instant classic among Southern memoirs of the last 50 years.\"<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/arts/review-hold-still-sally-manns-memoir-reveals-a-rich-life.html Dwight Garner,  Review: 'Hold Still,' Sally Mann's Memoir, Reveals a Photographer's Rich Life, NY Times Book Review May 5, 2015]</ref> An article by Mann adapted from this book appeared with photographs in [[The New York Times Magazine]] in April 2015.<ref>Sally Mann.\"[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/magazine/the-cost-of-sally-manns-exposure.html Exposure]\", The New York Times Magazine, April 19, 2015.</ref>\n\nHer current projects include a series of self-portraits, a multipart study of the legacy of slavery in Virginia, and intimate images of her family and life.<ref name=\"hook\">Laura Parsons, \"[http://www.readthehook.com/Stories/2007/05/10/COVER-3LookMannSidebar-0619.rtf.aspx The lyrical lens: Sally Mann\u2019s poetry in stillness]\", ''The Hook'', May 10, 2007, Charlottesville, Va.]</ref> The latter, entitled \"Marital Trust,\" spans 30 years, and includes intimate details of her family life with Larry.<ref>NPR, \"[http://www.npr.org/2011/02/17/133595585/from-lens-to-photo-sally-mann-captures-her-love From Lens To Photo: Sally Mann Captures Her Love]\" \"All Things Considered,\" February 17, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn May 2011 she delivered the three-day [[Massey Lectures (Harvard University)|Massey Lecture Series at Harvard]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~amciv/massey/index-2011.shtml |series=The William E.

Her paintings, statements, and influential writings often reflected an interest in Eastern philosophy, especially [[Taoism|Taoist]].

Her work reflects a deep understanding of both place and paint\".\n\nCommenting on her most recent one woman exhibition McClean stated:\n<blockquote>\n\"Painting for me is a necessary means of self-expression. My desire as a painter is to establish a relationship between intuitive imagery, and a spontaneous method of painting.

During that time she met a number of budding musicians in Britain's blues scene.<ref name=\"birminghammail.co.uk\"/> Her first foray into the music field didn't come until she met two friends, [[Stan Webb]] and [[Andy Silvester]] in a pub one night. At the time, they were playing in a band called \"Sounds Of Blue\" which had a few dates booked, but no bass guitarist.

After five years, McVie graduated from art college with a teaching degree, but by that time \"Sounds of Blue\" had split up.\n\nFresh out of art college, McVie found she did not have enough money to launch herself into the art world, so she moved to London, where she worked briefly as a department store [[window dresser]].<ref name=\"perfect\"/>\n\n=== Chicken Shack ===\nIn 1967 McVie learned that her ex-band mates, Andy Silvester and Stan Webb, were forming a blues band, [[Chicken Shack]], and were looking for a pianist. She wrote to them asking to join, and they invited her to play keyboards/piano and to sing background vocals. Chicken Shack's debut release was \"It's Okay With Me Baby\", written by and featuring McVie.<ref name=\"perfect\"/> She stayed with Chicken Shack for two albums, during which her genuine feel for the blues became evident, not only in her [[Sonny Thompson]]-style piano playing, but through her authentic \"bluesy\" voice.<ref>Fleetwood Mac, by Steve Clarke, Proteus Books, 1984, p. 47</ref>  Chicken Shack had a hit with \"[[I'd Rather Go Blind]]\", which featured McVie on lead vocals.<ref>Fleetwood Mac, by Steve Clarke, Proteus Books, 1984, p. 48</ref> Perfect received a [[Melody Maker]] award for female vocalist in both 1969 and 1970. McVie left Chicken Shack in 1969 after marrying Fleetwood Mac bassist [[John McVie]] a year earlier.\n\n==Fleetwood Mac==\nMcVie was a fan of Fleetwood Mac at the time, and while touring with Chicken Shack, the two bands often would meet. They also were \"label mates\" at [[Blue Horizon]], and Fleetwood Mac had asked McVie to play piano as a session musician for Peter Green's songs on the band's second album, ''Mr. Wonderful''.<ref>Mike Vernon's CD Booklet, Fleetwood Mac: The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions 1967-1969, Chapter 2</ref>\n\nEncouraged to continue her career, McVie recorded a solo album, ''[[Christine Perfect (album)|Christine Perfect]]''; following her success as a member of Fleetwood Mac, the album was reissued under the name ''The Legendary Christine Perfect Album''. After marrying Fleetwood Mac bassist [[John McVie]], McVie joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970. She had already contributed backup vocals and painted the cover for ''[[Kiln House]]''. The band had just lost founding member [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], and its members were nervous about touring without him. McVie had been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac; and since she knew all the lyrics to their songs, she went along.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=1048&c=2 |title=Goldmine Magazine 1992 interview|publisher=Bla.fleetwoodmac.net|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nMcVie went on to become an integral member, another lead vocalist and keyboardist of the group and the first album with her as a full-fledged band member was [[Future Games]], recorded at London's Advision Studios and also the first with American-born member [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] in place of founding member [[Jeremy Spencer]]. [[Danny Kirwan]] was still in the band at this point, but he was fired in 1972 after an incident on tour where he smashed his guitar prior to a gig after a row with Welch.\n\nThe early 1970s was a rocky time for the band, with a revolving door of musicians; and only the albums ''[[Bare Trees]]'' and ''[[Mystery to Me]]'', scored any successes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockhall.com/inductees/fleetwood-mac/bio/ |title=Fleetwood Mac Biography &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, a group impersonating Fleetwood Mac (which later became [[Stretch (band)|Stretch]]) was touring the United States with encouragement from the band's manager, [[Clifford Davis (music manager)|Clifford Davis]]. The tour collapsed, but it led to a protracted lawsuit between Davis and Fleetwood Mac (or Stretch?).<ref>\"[[Bob Brunning]] \u2013 Fleetwood Mac: Behind The Masks\", Hodder & Stoughton, 1990.</ref>\n\nIn 1974 McVie reluctantly agreed to move with the rest of Fleetwood Mac to the U.S. and make a fresh start. Within a year [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Lindsey Buckingham]] of [[Buckingham Nicks]] joined the band, giving it an added dimension. Their first album together, 1975's ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'', had several hit songs, with McVie's \"[[Over My Head (Fleetwood Mac song)|Over My Head]]\" and \"[[Say You Love Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Say You Love Me]]\", both reaching [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s top-20 singles chart. It was \"Over My Head\" which first put Fleetwood Mac on American radio and into the national Top 20.<ref>Fleetwood Mac, by Steve Clarke, Proteus Books, 1984, p. 92</ref>\n\nIn 1976 McVie began an on-the-road affair with the band's lighting director,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=208&c=18 |title=Five Go Mad |publisher=Uncut Magazine |date=May 2003}}</ref> which inspired her to write \"[[You Make Loving Fun]]\", a top-10 hit on the landmark smash ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'', one of the best-selling albums of all-time. Her biggest hit was \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\", which climbed all the way to number three. The ''Rumours'' tour also included McVie's \"Songbird\", a ballad played as the encore of many Fleetwood Mac concerts.\n\nBy the end of the ''Rumours'' tour, the McVies were divorced. The 1979 double album ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'' produced three more US top-20 hits (\"Tusk\", which is also the band's first \"conceptual\" music video,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} \"Sara\", and Christine's \"Think About Me\"), but it came nowhere near to matching the success of the ''Rumours'' album.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=13&c=2 |title=Mac's McVie: Rumours Fly About Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie&mdash;And That's No Mirage |publisher=''[[US Magazine]]'' |date=25 September 1982}}</ref> The ''Tusk'' tour continued into 1980 after which the band took time apart. They reunited in 1981 to record the album ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'' at the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]]'s studio in France. The album, released in 1982, returned the band to the top of the US charts and also contained the top-5 hit \"[[Hold Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hold Me]]\", co-written by McVie. McVie's inspiration for the song was her tortured relationship with [[the Beach Boys|Beach Boys]] drummer [[Dennis Wilson]].<ref>Fleetwood, Mick & Stephen Davis.

She created hits with the songs \"[[Got a Hold on Me]]\" (Top 10 pop and #1 [[adult contemporary]]) and \"Love Will Show Us How\" (#30). A Third single, \"I'm The One\", was released but did not chart. McVie is quoted in ''The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits'' as saying of her solo album, \"Maybe it isn't the most adventurous album in the world, but I wanted to be honest and please my own ears with it.\"<ref name=Connelly>Connelly, Christopher.

Quintela went on to co-write many songs with her that were featured on subsequent Fleetwood Mac albums. The couple divorced in the mid-1990s. She rejoined Fleetwood Mac to record the ''[[Tango in the Night]]'' album, which went on to become the band's biggest success since ''Rumours'' 10 years earlier. The biggest hit from the album, which was top 5 in both the UK and U.S., was McVie's \"Little Lies\", co-written with her husband Quintela. Another McVie single from the album, \"Everywhere\", reached #4 in the UK, which would be the band's third highest ever chart peak there and their final top 40 UK hit to date (the single peaked at #14 in the U.S.).<ref>Roberts, David (2006). British Hit Singles & Albums. London: Guinness World Records Limited</ref>\n\nIn 1990 the band (now without Lindsey Buckingham) recorded ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]'', but the album only reached Gold status in the U.S.,<ref>Recording Industry Association of America sales figures. Certified 'Gold' on 19 July 1990.</ref> and only McVie's song \"Save Me\" made the U.S. Top 40. The album did, however, enter the UK album chart at #1 and reached Platinum status there. The second US single release from the album, McVie's \"Skies the Limit\" did not make the top\n100, but did chart the A/C at number 10. McVie had always been reluctant to go on concert tours, preferring to stay close to home with friends and family. Upon the death of her father, Cyril Perfect, while she was touring for ''Behind the Mask'', McVie made the decision to retire from touring altogether.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Mick Fleetwood autobiography, \"Play On\", 2014</ref> Despite the departure of Stevie Nicks, McVie remained loyal to Mick Fleetwood and her former husband John McVie, writing and recording a new track (\"Love Shines\") for the 1992 boxed set ''[[25 Years - The Chain]]'', and five songs for the band's 1995 album ''[[Time (Fleetwood Mac album)|Time]]''.\n\nThe members of the band seemed to have gone their separate ways until Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Lindsey Buckingham got together again for one of Buckingham's solo projects. Christine was soon asked to sing and play on some of the tracks. The four of them decided a full reunion was possible and Stevie Nicks was called back into the fold and the resulting live album, 1997's ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'', went to #1 on the U.S. album charts. Despite her reservations, McVie complied with the band's touring schedule, and then performed for the group's 1998 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], as well as the Grammy Awards show, and the [[BRIT Awards]] in the UK. McVie later revealed (in a 2014 \"Rolling Stone\" interview) that she had developed a phobia about flying, which was later treated with psychotherapy. This phobia was the reason she decided not to continue with Fleetwood Mac after 1998.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 2006 [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'' magazine]] named McVie, together with bandmates [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]], as the 83rd greatest living songwriter or songwriting team.<ref name=Paste>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2006/06/pastes-100-best-living-songwriters-the-list.html|title=Paste's 100 Best Living Songwriters: The List|work=pastemagazine.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Hiatus from Fleetwood Mac (1998-2014)===\nAfter ''The Dance'', McVie returned to England to be near her family and stepped out of public view until 2000 when she appeared in public to receive an [[Honorary Doctorate]] in music from the [[University of Greenwich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.gre.ac.uk/pr/releasearchive/464.htm|title=Fleetwood Mac Star, Christine McVie, Awarded Honorary Degree At Rochester Cathedral, 20 July 2000.|publisher=3.gre.ac.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> Sometime after leaving Fleetwood Mac, she and Quintela divorced.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn a 2004 interview, McVie admitted to not listening much to pop music anymore and stated instead a preference for [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/jun/18/1 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Surviving the Fleetwoods | first=Will | last=Hodgkinson | date=18 June 2004 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview|subject= Christine McVie |interviewer= Amy Scott |title= In The Meantime interview, part 4/6 |type= |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-inZpp2c76c |program= [[All Star Jams]] |callsign= |city= |date= |year= 2004 |month= |accessdate= 7 October 2010 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> In December 2003, McVie went to see Fleetwood Mac's last UK performance on the ''Say You Will'' tour in London, but did not join her former bandmates on the stage.<ref>{{cite interview|subject= Christine McVie |interviewer= Amy Scott |title= In The Meantime interview, part 3/6 |type= |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6p2MQ55hz0 |program= [[All Star Jams]] |callsign= |city= |date= |year= 2004 |month= |accessdate= 7 October 2010 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> Mid-2004 saw the release of McVie's new solo album, ''[[In the Meantime (album)|In the Meantime]]'', her third in a career spanning five decades.

They frequently juxtapose seductive soft elements, often with strongly sexual overtones, with harder materials, often spikey or in some way appearing to constrain the softer parts, resulting in work which is both sensual and threatening. Her 1997 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in particular made reference to organic forms (crustacea, fossils), animals, erotic and fetishistic imagery, turn of the century decorative traditions, architectural detailing and saintly relics.<ref>Pennina Barnett  ' Materiality,Subjectivity & Abjection in the Work of Chohreh Feyzdjou,Nina Saunders and Cathy de Monchaux' issue 7 July 1998 n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal online pp.4-11</ref>\n\nDe Monchaux's work from the early 1990s often achieves this effect by the combination of red [[velvet]] and [[steel]] in simple and strong constructions, but later works have tended to move towards lighter colours, and a more ornamental approach.\n\nDe Monchaux was shortlisted for the [[Turner Prize]] in 1998. She currently lives in London and is a part-time teacher at the [[Slade School of Art]]. However, she has exhibited in the United States almost as much as, if not more than, she has in England.\n\nIn her recent work de Monchaux has concentrated more on subjects such as battles, unicorns and imagery confusing fauna, mineral and flora  e.g. ''The Raft'', ''State Secrets''.\n\nIn ''Sweetly the Air Flew Overhead, Battle with Unicorns'' (2007-8), the work shows small soft sculptures of riders on unicorns entangled in string. cloth and tree figures. It is reminiscent of Uccello's ''Battle of San Romano'' series where distinct horses, lances and knights celebrate human control and clarity not least in the painter's obsessive use of perspective. By contrast, Monchaux depicts  a battle with spike-helmet knights riding unicorns that struggle in a chaos of things: to be in a battle   is to be inside a mess.\n\nMonchaux herself has mentioned recognizing an unconscious allusion here to the [[Iraq War]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&artistid=2354&page=1 Works in the Tate Collection]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Monchaux, Cathy De}}\n[[Category:1960 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Contemporary sculptors]]\n[[Category:20th-century British sculptors]]\n[[Category:21st-century sculptors]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Goldsmiths, University of London]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Camberwell College of Arts]]\n[[Category:20th-century women artists]]\n[[Category:21st-century women artists]]"}]},"5890268":{"pageid":5890268,"ns":0,"title":"Belinda Montgomery"},"14874209":{"pageid":14874209,"ns":0,"title":"Kelly L.

She is also well known in Mexico for her work dealing with the [[deaths in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], the mass murder of young women along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMorillas graduated from the school of artes pl\u00e1sticas at [[UNAM]] (Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico).

Establishing her style in 1949 she then used her form of media to conduct research on the interplay of lines and their relationship to colored surfaces, angles, the point of geometric shapes, horizontal and vertical.\n\nBeginning as a student, in 1912, she enrolled at the [[\u00c9cole du Louvre|Ecole du Louvre]] to study [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Byzantine art]]. In 1941 Aurelie Nemours returned to the Andre Lhote Academy. In 1945, she began writing [[poetry]]. While for the first time at the Salon of Sacred Art she exhibited in 1946 until 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afartcontemporain.com/etchings/a-nemours|title=A. NEMOURS|work=Am\u00e9lie Formey Art Contemporain}}</ref>\n\nBefore any development, she made measurements, studies, sketches and drawings. Then she went into the essential, black and white or color; for her, the color is \u201cpure energy.\u201d Following an [[apprenticeship]], she developed her vision at various studios and most notably [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]]\u2019s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/artist/aurelie-nemours|title=Aurelie Nemours|work=artsy.net}}</ref> Inspired by L\u00e9ger, Nemour softens her edges of shapes and lines, imbuing her canvases with sensuality of the act of painting itself. She worked in black and white and bold colors, and honed her visual vocabulary to horizontal and vertical planes, right angles, lines, rectangles, and ultimately, the square, her ideal representation of universal harmony. She works in series thus from 1965- 1970: the square becomes the key size of her work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionsocietegenerale.com/en/pieces_of_art/5902-structure_du_silence_c.html|title=Structure du silence C - Artworks - Collection Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale|work=collectionsocietegenerale.com}}</ref> Although she stopped painting in 2002, she is honored now and in the future by the artists who have worked consistently and innovatively in the field of thought asserting their own vision.\n\nThere have been several articles about Aur\u00e9lie Nemours, including '11th Edition of Artparis Welcomed 43.000 Visitors' written for ArtDaily in 2009.

She received her undergraduate degree in [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]] from Princeton and her master's degree in architecture from the [[Yale School of Architecture]].\n\nShe is a representative of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]].\n\n==Life==\nIn 1977, Plater-Zyberk was co-founder of the Miami firm [[Arquitectonica]] with her husband [[Andr\u00e9s Duany]], Bernardo Fort-Brescia, [[Laurinda Hope Spear]], and Hervin Romney. Arquitectonica became famous for its signature style: a dramatic, expressive \"high-tech\" [[modernism]]. The firm's [[Atlantis Condominium]] was featured prominently in the opening credits of ''[[Miami Vice]]''.\n\nDuany and Plater-Zyberk founded [[Duany Plater Zyberk & Company]] (DPZ) in 1980, with its headquarters in Miami. DPZ became a leader in the national movement called the [[New Urbanism]] and distinguished itself by designing traditional towns and [[retrofitting]] into existing suburbs into livable downtowns. The firm first received international recognition in the 1980s as the designer of [[Seaside, Florida]], and has completed designs and codes for over two hundred new towns, regional plans, and community revitalization projects.\n\nPlater-Zyberk began teaching at the [[University of Miami]] School of Architecture in 1979, starting what became a long and successful association. Having created a graduate program in Suburb and Town Design in 1988, she continued to explore contemporary issues in city growth and reconstruction with students and faculty. She served as dean of the university's School of Architecture from 1995 to 2013,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Alexander|title=School of Architecture dean to step down in July|url=http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/06/20/school-of-architecture-dean-to-step-down-in-july/|accessdate=6 December 2015|agency=The Miami Hurricane|date=June 13, 2013}}</ref> and as dean she hired the architect [[L\u00e9on Krier]] to design his first public building in Florida for the school of architecture (his only other buildings in America are his former house at Seaside and a meeting hall in the Duany Plater-Zyberk resort of Windsor). She has also served as director of the university's Center for Urban Community and Design, organizing and promoting numerous design exercises to the benefit of communities throughout South Florida. In the Fall of 2008, Plater-Zyberk was tapped into Iron Arrow Honor Society, the highest Honor attained at the University of Miami. In 2014, she was awarded the Arts & Culture Award by the Coral Gables Community Foundation.\n\nFor ten years, Plater-Zyberk was a Trustee of [[Princeton University]], where she chaired the university's Building Committee during an active period of building and expansion. Architects hired during her tenure on the Building Committee included Princeton graduate [[Robert Venturi]], internationally famous [[Frank Gehry]], and the traditional architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Porphyrios designed the Collegiate Gothic [[Whitman College]], the first in a series of new Gothic buildings to be built in the historic center of the university.\n\nPlater-Zyberk is a founder and emeritus board member of the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]], which was established in 1993. She has been a visiting professor at many major North American schools of architecture, has been awarded several honorary doctorates and awards, and lectures frequently. In 2001, she and Duany were awarded the [[Vincent Scully Prize]] by the [[National Building Museum]] in recognition of their contributions to the American built environment.<ref>http://www.alysbeach.com/ArchitectureandHomeDesign/DuanyPlaterZyberk/tabid/108/Default.aspx</ref> In 2008, she was appointed to the [[U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]].<ref>Thomas E.
