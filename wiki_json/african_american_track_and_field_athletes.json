She ran under the 11-second barrier over 30 times and was the first to run under 11 seconds in an Olympic Games.<ref name=\"sports-reference.com\">{{cite Sports-Reference |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/as/evelyn-ashford-1.html |title=Evelyn Ashford}}</ref>\n\nAs a 18-year-old, Ashford finished 5th in the 100 m event at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. After beating the World Record holders in the 100 m and 200 m in 1979 at the World Cup of Track and Field in Montreal, Ashford was one of the potential medalists for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], but these Games were [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted by the United States]]. Evelyn also tore a quad muscle in May, and was out for the rest of the season.\n\nAshford was ranked #1 in the world by ''[[Track & Field News]]'' over 100 metres in 1979 and 1981,<ref name=\"T&FN100\">[http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/rankings/women/100worldranking.pdf T&FN 100m rankings] www.trackandfieldnews.com</ref> and over 200 metres in 1981.<ref name=\"T&FN200\">[http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/rankings/women/200worldranking.pdf T&FN 200m rankings] www.trackandfieldnews.com</ref>  She also was named Track and Field News \"Athlete of the Year\" twice, in 1981 and 1984<ref>[http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/archive/us_aoy.html Athlete of the Year] www.trackandfieldnews.com</ref>\n\nShe would again win the sprint double, at the World Cup of Track and Field in Rome, in 1981.\n\nOn July 3, 1983, she set her first World Record (be it at altitude) for the 100 metres, running 10.79 seconds at the National Sports Festival in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]] and was one of the favourites to win the 100 metre title at the [[1983 World Championships in Athletics|inaugural World Championships]] in [[Helsinki]]. In the final, however, she pulled a [[hamstring]] muscle and fell.  The other main favourite, [[Marlies G\u00f6hr]] of [[East Germany]] (who had already beaten Ashford earlier that year) went on to win.\n\nAt the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], Ashford had a chance to win a gold medal. However, she had to withdraw from the 200 m heats with a minor injury. She competed in the [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 100 metres|100 m]], winning the event in a new Olympic Record of 10.97 secs. As the anchor runner for 4 X 100 m relay team, she won a second gold medal. In the absence of World Champions and world record holders East Germany, the US team clocked one of the fastest times in history and won by the biggest margin ever at an Olympics, 1.12 seconds.<ref name=\"sports-reference.com\" />\n\nLater in the season, she finally defeated her main rival G\u00f6hr at the [[Weltklasse]] meeting in [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Switzerland]]. The race saw Ashford make up half a metre or so over G\u00f6hr and lower her own World Record to 10.76 secs.  {{YouTube|-Mdu3fQXBUE|See the race}} That race proved to be Ashford's personal record.  It still ranks as the #8 Individual all-time<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/toplists/inout=o/age=n/season=0/sex=W/all=y/legal=A/disc=100/detail.html IAAF All Time list] www.iaaf.org</ref> Ashford, unsurprisingly, regained her #1 ''Track & Field News'' ranking.<ref name=\"T&FN100\" />\n\nAt the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], she was the flag bearer for the United States team at the Opening Ceremony. She was beaten in the 100 m by [[Florence Griffith Joyner]], who had broken her World Record earlier in the season at the [[1988 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|Olympic Trials]]. In the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 x 100 metre relay|4 \u00d7 100 m relay]] she again ran the final leg, winning her third Olympic gold medal despite a less than perfect last exchange between Griffith-Joyner and Ashford that required Ashford to run a sensational final leg to overtake G\u00f6hr.<ref name=\"sports-reference.com\" />\n\nAt her [[1992 Summer Olympics|last Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]] Ashford, aged 35, was eliminated in the 100 m semi-finals by 1/100th of a second; she went on to win her third straight Olympic 4 \u00d7 100 m relay gold, this time running 1st leg. She is one of only six women to have won four gold medals in track and field Olympic history.<ref name=\"sports-reference.com\" />\n\nAshford came back from season ending injuries three times, to reach the top of the sport in the following year. In 1980 she injured her quad, and returned in 1981 with the sprint double at the World Cup and the number one world ranking in both sprints. After an injury in 1983, she became double Olympic Champion in 1984. In 1987 a hamstring pull prevented her from competing at the World Championships, then a season later added an Olympic Silver and third Gold medal to her collection.\n\nOn May 30, 1985 she gave birth to her daughter Raina Ashley Washington, and again came back for an excellent 1986, losing only once over both the 100 m and 200 m, and winning the 100 meter title at the Goodwill Games; earning another #1 ranking by ''Track & Field News'' over the shorter distance.\n\nAfter parting ways with her coach [[Pat Winslow|Pat Connolly]] (herself a 3-time Olympian) in 1985, Ashford was largely self-coached.\n\nIn 1997, Ashford was inducted into the [[National Track and Field Hall of Fame]],<ref>[http://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=7 USATF Hall of Fame Bio] www.usatf.org</ref> where she is said to be \"one of the greatest track and field runners ever.\" Ashford went to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and [[Roseville High School (Roseville, California)|Roseville High School]].  She was inducted into the [[UCLA Bruins#UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame|UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame]] in 1990.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IAAF name|id=60079|name=Evelyn

This was due to a very strong team which included all three U.S sprinters that made the 100m final and Brown's superb start. The US were clear favourites as the [[GDR]] and [[USSR]] teams who would have provided stiff competition were absent due to the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Eastern Bloc boycott]]. The team was never seriously challenged, leading from gun to tape and triumphing with a time of 41.60 seconds, one of the fastest times in history.\n\nIn the 1988 [[Seoul Olympic Games]] all nations were present for the first time since the Montr\u00e9al games in 1976. In the final of the Women\u2019s 4\u00d7100 Relay all the strongest nations were present except for the Jamaicans who were non starters.\n\nAlice Brown once again led the United States challenge running the first leg, in a superb piece of relay running she left the field trailing in her wake, by the time she handed over to [[Sheila Echols]] (2nd Leg), she had caught and was passing the Bulgarian athlete in the next lane. [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] (3rd Leg) took over and ran solidly, handed over to Evelyn Ashford (anchor) who in very impressive fashion made up three metres on [[Marlies G\u00f6hr]] and led the US team to victory by a clear metre. The winning time was down (41.97 seconds) on the U.S record due to sloppy baton exchanges. It was superior basic speed and sheer talent that won the U.S their second consecutive gold in this event.\n\nIn 1987 Alice won 4\u00d7100 relay Gold at the World Championships Rome, Italy.

She competed and excelled in the basketball throw, which led up to the shot put.<ref>Jet, 10 April 1958, p.&nbsp;54</ref> While attending Jordan High, she was discovered by Adeline Valdez, Josephine Spearman and Clarence Mackey, who tried to get her to turn out for the [[Helsinki Olympics]], but she was then \"too busy going to dances\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBrown joined the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) at 21 in 1956, by which time she was already married to Henry Brown, a bricklayer, and had a baby boy, Reginald, born November 19, 1954.<ref name=\"Commire 1999 p.100\"/><ref>Silden , Isobel (1973).

Since the Browns could not afford to pay for Earlene's training and traveling expenses, Brad Pye Jr., am influential sports editor of the [[Los Angeles Sentinel]] and African-American community activist, led a campaign that raised funds to support her. Shortly thereafter, though, Brown and her husband separated and Reggie was left in the care of his grandmother. To support herself, Brown began attending Henrietta's Beauty College to become a hairdresser.<ref>Davis, Michael (1992). Black American women in Olympic track and field, p.31</ref>\n\nFrom 1959 on, Brown was associated with the Tennessee State University \"Tigerbelles\", whose coach [[Ed Temple]] was also the Head Coach of the U.S. Olympic Women's Track and Field Team. Temple spent time 'getting Earlene in shape' for the 1960 Games<ref>Mead-Tricard, Louise (1996) American Women's Track and Field: A History, 1895 Through 1980 (Vol. 1), p. 423</ref> and Earlene then became one of [[Wilma Rudolph]]'s closest friends.<ref>Smith, Maureen (2006). Wilma Rudolph: A Biography, p. 15</ref> At the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games in Rome]], Brown won the bronze medal in the women's shot put. In the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo]], Brown \u2013 who was short-sighted and wore heavy glasses as a consequence, except when throwing \u2013 was \"beset by both wind and rain and lost her footing and a chance to get a toehold on the crown\".<ref>Barbee, Bobby. \"How Negroes helped U.S. in Tokyo Olympics\" In ''Jet'' \u2013 5 November 1964, p. 54</ref> In 1965 she retired from shot put competition. The same year she became a skater. As a blocker for the New York Bombers Roller Derby team,<ref>Jet, 7 December 1967, p. 52</ref> she was dubbed the \"Brown Bomber\". In 1975, after retiring from all athletic endeavors, she returned to her practice as beautician. She died aged 47, on May 1, 1983 in [[Compton, California]].\n\n==Track and field career==\nBrown was the first American woman to medal in the shot put, one of the only two United States women to place at Rome and the only shot-putter to compete in three consecutive Olympics. She has been described by Nathan Aaseng as \"the most unheralded U.S. athlete of all time\".<ref>Aaseng (2003). African-American Athletes, p. 33</ref> Her events of choice were the [[shot put]] and [[discus]] throwing. Brown finished in the top ten in the shot put and discus in the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]], setting American records in both events.\n\nBrown was an eight-time (1956\u20131962 and 1964) and three-time (1958, 1959 and 1961) national champion in the shot put and discus, respectively.  In 1958 she received the #1 world ranking and became the first American to break the 50-foot barrier in the shot put. In 1959 she won gold medals in both the shot put and discus events at the [[1959 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]]. On December 1, 2005 Brown was posthumously inducted in the [[National Track and Field Hall of Fame]] by the [[USA Track and Field]] (USATF) during the [[Jesse Owens Award]]s and Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony held in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].<ref>[http://www.usatf.org/news/view.aspx?DUID=USATF_2005_11_03_10_16_51 Kingdom, Powell, McDonnell lead 2005 inductees to National Track & Field Hall of Fame].

Retrieved on 2009-11-21.</ref>\n\n==Roller games career==\nAfter her career in the international track and field community, Brown made her debut in the banked track sport of [[roller games]] in 1965. She began her skating career with Roller Games' Texas Outlaws and New York Bombers. At almost 6 feet tall (on skates) and over 250 pounds, Brown quickly became one of the sport's most feared defensive skaters \u2013 her signature move being \"the bear hug.\"  After a brief retirement, Brown returned to roller games, skating with the World Famous, World Champion [[Los Angeles Thunderbirds]]. It was at this juncture that she became known in the sport as \"747\" because of her size and weight. After the 1975 season, Brown permanently retired from roller games.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Footer Pan American Champions Shot Put Women}}\n{{Footer Pan American Champions Discus Women}}\n{{Footer US NC shot put Women}}\n{{Footer US NC Discus Throw Women}}\n{{Footer USA Track & Field 1956 Summer Olympics}}\n{{Footer USA Track & Field 1960 Summer Olympics}}\n{{Footer USA Track & Field 1964 Summer Olympics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brown, Earlene}}\n[[Category:1935 births]]\n[[Category:1983 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Laredo, Texas]]\n[[Category:Track and field people from California]]\n[[Category:American female shot putters]]\n[[Category:American female discus throwers]]\n[[Category:African-American female track and field athletes]]\n[[Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States]]\n[[Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in track and field]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1956 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1960 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1964 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Pan American Games competitors for the United States]]\n[[Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States]]\n[[Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field)]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1959 Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 1960 Summer Olympics]]"}]},"36096132":{"pageid":36096132,"ns":0,"title":"T'erea Brown"},"15550600":{"pageid":15550600,"ns":0,"title":"Dawn Burrell"},"9574298":{"pageid":9574298,"ns":0,"title":"Shelia Burrell","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{distinguish|Sheila Burrell}}\n'''Shelia Burrell''' (born 15 January 1972 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[heptathlete]].

American retired [[track and field]] athlete. A three-time [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] champion  for the [[United States Olympic Team]], she is also an inductee of the [[National Track and Field Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Life and career==\nDevers was born in [[Seattle, Washington]], and grew up near [[National City, California]], graduating from [[Sweetwater High School (National City, California)|Sweetwater High School]] in 1984.<ref name=usatf.org/> (Sweetwater's football and track stadium would later be named Gail Devers Stadium.) A young talent in the [[100 metres|100 m]] and [[100 metres hurdles|100 m hurdles]], Devers was in training for the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], started experiencing health problems, suffering from among others [[migraine]] and vision loss. She qualified for the Olympics 100 m hurdles, in which she was eliminated in the semi-finals, but her health continued to deteriorate even further.\n\nIn 1990, she was diagnosed with [[Graves-Basedow disease|Graves' disease]], and underwent [[Iodine-131|radioactive iodine treatment]] followed by [[levothyroxine|thyroid hormone replacement therapy]]. During her radiation treatment, Devers began to develop blistering and swelling of her feet.  Eventually, the sprinter could barely walk and had to crawl and or be carried.  A doctor considered amputating her feet.  Amazingly, Devers recovered after the radiation treatment was discontinued, and she resumed training. At the 1991 World Championships, she won a [[silver medal]] in the 100 m hurdles.\n\nAt the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], Devers starred. She qualified for the final of the 100 m, which ended in an exciting finish, with five women finishing close (within 0.06 seconds). The [[photo finish]] showed Devers had narrowly beaten [[Jamaica]]n [[Juliet Cuthbert]]. In the final of the 100 m hurdles, Devers' lead event, she seemed to be running towards a second [[gold medal]], when she hit the final hurdle and stumbled over the finish line in fifth place, leaving [[Voula Patoulidou]] from [[Greece]] as the upset winner.\n\nIn 1993, Devers won the 100 m World Championship title after - again - a photo finish win over [[Merlene Ottey]] in an apparent dead heat, and the 100 m hurdles title. She retained her hurdles title in 1995.\n\nThe 100 m final at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] was an almost exact repeat of the World Championships final three years before. Ottey and Devers again finished in the same time and did not know who had won the race. Again, both were awarded the same time, but Devers was judged to have finished first and became the first woman to retain the Olympic 100 m title since [[Wyomia Tyus]]. In the final of her favorite event, Devers again failed, as she finished fourth and outside of the medals. With the [[4 x 100 metres relay|4 \u00d7 100 m relay]] team, Devers won her third Olympic medal.\n\nAfter these Olympics, Devers concentrated on the hurdles event, winning the World Championship again in 1999, but she had to forfeit for the semi-finals at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].\n\nDevers left competition in 2005 to give birth to a child with her husband and returned in 2006.\n\nOn February 2, 2007, at the age of 40, Devers edged 2004 Olympic champion [[Joanna Hayes]] to win the [[60 metres hurdles|60 m hurdles]] event at the [[Millrose Games]] in 7.86 seconds - the best time in the world that season and just 0.12 off the record she set in 2003. Furthermore, the time bettered the listed World Record for a 40-year-old by almost 7 tenths of a second.<ref>http://world-masters-athletics.org/records/indoor-women WMA World Indoor Record</ref>\n\nDuring her career, Devers was notable for having exceptionally long, heavily decorated fingernails.  One of the fastest starters in the world, Devers even had to alter her starting position to accommodate her long nails.<ref>http://longnailz.blogspot.com/2009/03/gail-deverss-long-nails-1.html</ref>  Her long nails came as the result of a contest her father devised to get her to stop biting her nails as a child.<ref>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n5_v52/ai_19201548/</ref>\n\n==Achievements and recognition==\nIn 2011, she was elected into the [[National Track and Field Hall of Fame]].

[[United States|American]] [[Sprint (running)|sprinter]]. She competes in [[100 metres|100]] and [[200 meters]], winning an Olympic medal in [[4\u00d7100-meter relay]] in [[Athletics at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]. In 2003 she won six medals in major international competitions, including one World Championship gold. Edwards competed in the 100&nbsp;m at the [[2008 Olympic Games]].\n\n==Early career==\nEdwards states that she began sprinting when she joined her school team in junior high .<ref name=\"MSN\"/> Edwards was an average sprinter when she attended [[Pomona High School (Pomona, California)|Pomona High School]], with her best state meet finish ever coming her senior year when she was fourth in the 200m. Edwards would then attend the [[University of Southern California]].<ref name=USColympians>[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/usc/genrel/auto_pdf/uscolympians.pdf USC OLYMPIANS: 1904-2008], USC Trojans Athletic Department, Accessed August 26, 2008.</ref>\n\nThat track season, she won the Pac-10 titles in both the 100 m and 200 m for USC.<ref name=\"MSN\"/>\nShe states: <blockquote>\"Not until I got to college did I realize that I could be good,\" Edwards said. \"Winning the Pac-10 titles gave me a big boost in confidence, and I found myself setting higher and higher goals.\"<ref name=\"MSN\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Doping ban==\nIt later turned out that she had used the banned substance [[nikethamide]]. She was banned for two years effective from July 18, 2004, missing the [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]]. In August 2004, Edwards appealed the ban, and an arbitration panel acknowledged that Edwards \"conducted herself with honesty, integrity and character ... she has not sought to gain any improper advantage or to 'cheat' in any way.\"<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/media/acrobat/2006-12/26797863.pdf]</ref> In November 2005, her two-year ban was shortened to 15 months when the World Anti-Doping Agency downgraded nikethamide infractions to maximum one-year suspensions.<ref name=\"MSN\"/> The drug had come from pills she had taken at a meet in Martinique to combat a minor illness. Though arbitrators decided Edwards had taken the drug inadvertently, saying in their ruling that she had conducted herself with \"honesty, integrity and character,\" they did not overturn the suspension, because the glucose tablets given to her by her doctor contained a warning for athletes advising that the pills could cause a positive doping test.<ref name=\"MSN\"/> Therefore, Edwards did not take performance enhancement drugs to improve her performance.<ref name=\"MSN\"/><ref>[http://www.usada.org/testing/results/sanctions/ USADA Sanctions]. USADA. Retrieved on 2015-01-23.</ref>\n\nHowever, since Edwards was a teammate of [[Marion Jones]] in the 2000 Olympic 4&times;100 meters relay, she was stripped of her medal following Jones's admission to using steroids during the games, though she and 6 other members of the 2000 team would successfully appeal this decision in July 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=oly&id=5385884|title=US relay runners win Olympic medals appeal|author=Associated Press|date=April 10, 2008|publisher=ESPN}}</ref>\n\n==Personal bests==\n*[[100 meters]] - 10.78 (2008)\n*[[200 meters]] - 22.28 (2003\n\n==2008 Olympics==\nAt the [[2008 Olympics|2008 Olympic finals]] for the women's 100 meters, Edwards stated that she thought she had [[false started]] and apparently hesitated, believing that the officials were going to call a false start.\n\nEdwards eventually finished eighth place with a time of 11.20, an under-par performance for the American sprinter, who has a best time of 10.78. Edwards states:<blockquote>\u201cI thought I moved before the gun,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI kind of hesitated because I expected to hear a second gun. It threw me off a lot. It\u2019s pretty tough.\u201d</blockquote>\nHowever, Edwards actually had a reaction time of 0.179 seconds, which was not the fastest or the slowest of the eight runners.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/oly08/results/eventCode=3659/racedate=08-17-2008/sex=W/discCode=100/combCode=hash/roundCode=f/results.html#det 100 Metres - Women's Final]. ''[[IAAF]]''. 17 August 2008. Retrieved August 24, 2008</ref> It is possible, therefore, that Edwards had not applied enough pressure on the blocks to trigger a false start warning, however she twitched her upper body, but possibly left her feet solid.\"<ref>[http://in.reuters.com/article/worldOfSport/idINIndia-35053220080818?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0 When is a false start not a false start?].

Retrieved August 24. 2008</ref>\n\nAnother disappointment came in the 4\u00d7100 m relay when the American team dropped the baton in the semi-final due to a misunderstanding between Edwards, on the top bend, and [[Lauryn Williams]] on the anchor leg. Williams picked up the baton to finish the race in last place, but the USA was disqualified because she had had to run out of her lane in order to retrieve the baton.\n\n==International competitions==\n{| {{AchievementTable|Event=yes}}\n|-\n|2000\n|[[Athletics at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]]\n|[[Sydney, Australia]]\n|bgcolor=\"CC9966\" | 3rd\n|4\u00d7100 m relay\n|DQ - doping by [[Marion Jones]]\n|-\n|rowspan=6|2003\n|[[2003 IAAF World Indoor Championships|World Indoor Championships]] \n|[[Birmingham]], United Kingdom\n|bgcolor=\"silver\"| 2nd\n|60 m\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[2003 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] \n|rowspan=3|[[Paris]], France\n|bgcolor=\"gold\"| 1st\n|100 m\n| 10.93 PB\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"silver\"| 2nd\n|200 m\n|\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"silver\"| 2nd\n|4\u00d7100 m relay\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[2003 IAAF World Athletics Final|World Athletics Final]]\n|rowspan=2|[[Monte Carlo]], Monaco\n|bgcolor=\"CC9966\"| 3rd\n|100 m\n|\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"CC9966\"| 3rd\n|200 m\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|[[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]\n|[[Beijing]], China\n|8th\n|[[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 100 metres|100 m]]\n|}\n\n==Coaching career==\nTorri Edwards was just named head track coach at [[Kentucky State University]] in August 2015.\n\nTorri Edwards brings a wealth of experience, both as a coach and as a former world-class sprinter to the [[University of Kentucky]] track and field teams (2014 and 2015). She worked 2 seasons with the UK track and field programs.\n\nCoach Edwards served as an assistant coach in the [[Riverside Community College]] track and field program. While serving as an assistant at RCC, Edwards helped the men's track and field team capture conference and state titles in 2012 and 2013.\n\nEdwards most recently worked as a volunteer assistant at [[Cal Poly Pomona]] the past two years. She helped Angela Garcia reach the [[NCAA]] Division II National Championships in just her first collegiate season of track and field. Garcia also earned All-West Region honors for her work in the 100- and 200-meter events.\n\nWhile Edwards was at Cal Poly Pomona, the teams boasted 12 individual conference champions, and more than 25 Broncos received All-CCAA honors.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of doping cases in athletics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Torri Edwards}}\n*{{iaaf name|136060}}\n*[http://www.usolympicteam.com/26_1353.htm Torri Edwards' U.S. Olympic Team bio]\n*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEMfTZUxtxc Torri Edwards wins Nike Prefontaine Classic, in Eugene, Oregon]\n{{Footer World Champions 100 m Women}}\n{{Footer US NC 100m Women}}\n{{Footer US NC 200m Women}}\n{{Footer USA Track & Field 2000 Summer Olympics}}\n{{Footer USA Track & Field 2008 Summer Olympics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Edwards, Torri}}\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American female sprinters]]\n[[Category:African-American female track and field athletes]]\n[[Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2000 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Pan American Games competitors for the United States]]\n[[Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field)]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1999 Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:Doping cases in athletics]]\n[[Category:University of Southern California alumni]]\n[[Category:World Championships in Athletics athletes for the United States]]\n[[Category:World Championships in Athletics medalists]]\n[[Category:American sportspeople in doping cases]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in track and field]]"}]},"13928645":{"pageid":13928645,"ns":0,"title":"Dawn Ellerbe"},"6756010":{"pageid":6756010,"ns":0,"title":"Barbara Ferrell","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2014}}\n{{Infobox sportsperson\n| name = Barbara Ferrell\n| image =\n| caption =\n| birth_date = {{birth-date and age|July 28, 1947}}\n| birth_place = [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], U.S.\n| headercolor = lightsteelblue\n| show-medals = yes\n| medaltemplates =\n{{Medal|Sport| Women's [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] }}\n{{Medal|Country| the {{USA}} }}\n{{Medal|Olympics}}\n{{Medal|Gold| [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City]] | [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|4x100 metres relay]] }}\n{{Medal|Silver| 1968 Mexico City | [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 100 metres|100 metres]] }}\n{{Medal|Competition| [[Pan American Games]] }}\n{{Medal|Gold| [[1967 Pan American Games|1967 Winnipeg]] | [[Athletics at the 1967 Pan American Games|100 metres]] }}\n}}\n\n'''Barbara Ann Ferrell (-Edmonson)''' (born July 28, 1947 in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]]) is an [[United States|American]] former [[track and field]] athlete, who competed mainly in the [[100-meter dash]].\n\nShe competed for the United States at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] in the 100 metres where she finished second to team mate and 1964 Gold Medalist [[Wyomia Tyus]].

1930) is an [[Americans|American]] athlete who competed mainly in the [[100-meter dash]].  She won an [[Olympic gold medal]] in the [[4 x 100-meter relay]] at the 1952 [[Olympic Summer Games]] in [[Helsinki, Finland]]. Later Hardy married, had children, and a 30-year teaching career in Atlanta schools.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHardy Lavender was born in [[Carroll County, Georgia]], the third of eight children born to Ernest and Emma (Echols) Hardy. After graduating from Carroll County Training School at age 16, she wanted to attend [[Tuskegee Institute]]. Her family was a farming family of limited means, however; so she attended [[Fort Valley State College]] (now [[Fort Valley State University]]) instead.  Though West Georgia College (now [[University of West Georgia]]) was only a few miles from Hardy's home in Carrollton, schools were still segregated and as an [[African-American]], Hardy had to look elsewhere to attend college.\n\nIn college, Hardy continued playing basketball and enjoyed it. Raymond Pitts, the track coach at Fort Valley, encouraged her to look into track. She agreed, and in 1949, she ran and won her first race at the Tuskegee Relays. Two years later, she won the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) indoor meet in [[New York City]], winning the 50-yard [[dash]] and setting a new American record. From 1951-1952, she made [[All-American]].\n\nHardy received a lot of support at Fort Valley for her athletic pursuits. She worked very hard with her track coaches, Catherine and Richard Craig, and to this day, speaks of them with much fondness. Mr. Bill Burroughs of Fort Valley also had a great impact on her track life, serving as her student trainer.\n\nIn 1952, Hardy received her B.S. degree in [[Business Education]]. After graduation,  she trained hard in preparation for AAU events and the Olympic tryouts. At the AAU, Hardy was a triple winner, winning the 50-yard dash, as well as the 100- and 200-meter races.\n\n==To the Olympic Games==\nAt the U.S. Olympic tryouts in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], Hardy set an American record in the 200-meter  run, thus securing a position on the 1952 U.S. Olympic Women's Track Team. She was the only representative of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|state of Georgia]] that year in the Olympics, held in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. There, she anchored the 4x100 meter [[relay]]. She won the [[gold medal]] with her teammates [[Mae Faggs]], [[Barbara Jones (athlete)|Barbara Jones]] and [[Janet Moreau]]. This particular race was an [[upset]], because the [[Australians]] and their star, [[Marjorie Jackson]], whom they called \"Jet\", were heavily favored to win. A poor [[Baton (running)|baton]] transfer, however, beat the Australians' chances.\n\nOriginally, [[Janet Moreau]] was to serve as the [[anchor]] for the team, but when the coach realized that Hardy was the fastest runner on the team, the order was changed. Photographs and video of the race show that the race was quite close, but the US runner Hardy was the one who broke the tape at the finish, edging out [[Germany]], who took the [[silver medal]], and [[Great Britain]], who won the [[bronze medal]].\n\nNoteworthy is the fact that Hardy's time in the 100 meters she ran was faster than the winning time in the 100-meter race at this Olympics. Though Hardy had been slated to compete in that event as well, a poor showing in one of the heats killed her chances at advancement. Despite this fact, Hardy and her teammates set a new world record, and brought home the gold in this event.\n\nUpon returning to the States, Hardy was greeted with a [[ticker tape parade]] in her hometown, but further recognition was rather muted.\n\n==Career, marriage and family ==\n[[Image:chlavendertoday.jpg|thumb|left|A recent picture of Hardy Lavender.]]\n\nHardy was offered coaching positions in the northern U.S., but chose to enter her field of study\u2014education\u2014in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. There she settled, marrying the late Edward Wright Lavender, Sr. in 1956, and bearing two children\u2014a son Edward Lavender, Jr. in 1957, and a daughter Stephanie in 1960.\n\nHardy Lavender continued teaching, having a career that lasted over 30 years. She retired in 1986 to care for her aged mother who had [[Alzheimer's disease]]. After her mother died in 1987, Hardy Lavender returned to education by substitute teaching in the [[Atlanta Public Schools]] system.\n\nTo date, Hardy Lavender still lives a productive, independent life in Atlanta.

While there, she met and began dating one of the track coaches, [[shot put]]ter [[C.J. Hunter]]. Hunter voluntarily resigned his position at UNC to comply with the requirements of university rules prohibiting coach\u2013athlete dating. Jones and Hunter were married October 3, 1998, and trained for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn the run-up to the 2000 Olympics, Jones declared that she intended to win gold medals in all five of her competition events at Sydney.  Jones's husband, C.J. Hunter, had withdrawn from the shot-put competition for a knee injury, though he was allowed to keep his coaching credentials and attend the games to support his wife. However, just hours after Marion Jones won her first of the planned five golds, the IOC announced that Hunter had failed four pre-Olympic drug tests, testing positive each time for the banned anabolic steroid [[nandrolone]]. Hunter was immediately suspended from taking any role at the Sydney games, and he was ordered to surrender his on-field coaching credentials. At a press conference where Hunter broke down in tears, he denied taking any performance-enhancing drugs, much less the easily detected nandrolone (which showed up in all four tests in amounts over 1000 times normal levels);<ref name=\"cjhunter\">{{cite news |accessdate=2008-02-10 |url=http://static.espn.go.com/oly/summer00/news/2000/0925/777764.html |title=IOC chief says Hunter failed four drug tests |date=2000-09-25 |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com}}</ref> Victor Conte of BALCO, who was regularly supplying \"nutritional supplements\" to Graham's athletes, blamed the test results on \"an iron supplement\" that contained nandrolone precursors<ref name=\"fastestwoman\" /> and tied previous positive nandrolone tests from Jamaican sprinter [[Merlene Ottey]] and British sprinter [[Linford Christie]] to the same supplement.<ref name=\"cjhunter\" /> As late as 2004, Hunter was still denying the charges and was attempting to gain access to the results to see if they could be analyzed further.<ref name=Webby2004>{{cite news |accessdate=2007-11-16 |url=http://www.blackathlete.com/Track&Field/index.shtml |title=Hunter: 'It's been going on for a long, long time' |last=Webby |first=Sean |publisher=Black Athlete Sports Network |date=August 28, 2004 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927174809/http://www.blackathlete.com/Track&Field/index.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref> Jones would later write in her autobiography, ''Marion Jones: Life in the Fast Lane'', that Hunter's positive drug tests hurt their marriage and her image as a drug-free athlete. The couple divorced in 2002.\n\nOn June 28, 2003, Jones gave birth to a son (Tim Montgomery Jr.) with then-boyfriend [[Tim Montgomery]], a world class sprinter himself. Because of her pregnancy, Jones missed the 2003 World Championships but spent a year preparing for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]]. Montgomery, who did not qualify for the 2004 Olympic Track and Field team for poor performance, was charged by USADA, as part of the investigation into the [[BALCO]] doping scandal, with receiving and using banned performance-enhancing drugs and sought a four-year suspension for Montgomery. Montgomery fought the ban but lost the appeal on December 13, 2005, receiving a two-year ban from track and field competition; the Court for Arbitration of Sport (CAS) also stripped Montgomery of all race results, records, medals, etc., from March 31, 2001 onward. Montgomery later announced his retirement. The investigation into Montgomery's illegal substance use once more called into question Jones's own protests about not using steroids and never having been tested positive for steroids, especially in light of former trainer Trevor Graham's increasingly visible role in the BALCO case.\n\nOn February 24, 2007, Jones married [[Barbados|Barbadian]] sprinter and 2000 Olympic 100m bronze medalist [[Obadele Thompson]].<ref name=Cherry2007>{{cite news |accessdate= |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUSL0725699120070307 |title=Sprinters Jones and Thompson married, says minister |date=March 7, 2007 |author=Cherry, Gene |publisher=Reuters}}</ref> Their first child together, a son named Ahmir, was born in June 2007.<ref name=CNN20071005>{{cite news |accessdate= |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0710/05/cnr.06.html |title=CNN Newsroom: Jones Doping Case; Tax Standoff Ends; Myanmar Crackdown |work=CNN Transcripts |date=October 5, 2007}}</ref> She gave birth to daughter Eva-Marie on June 28, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/wnba/shock/2010-05-16-marion-jones-cover_N.htm |work=USA Today |first=Vicki |last=Michaelis |title=Marion Jones hits ground running, starts fresh in WNBA |date=May 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Sports career ==\n\n===Track and field===\nIn high school, Jones won the [[CIF California State Meet]] in the [[100 metres|100 m sprint]] four years in a row, representing [[Rio Mesa High School|Rio Mesa]] the first two years and [[Thousand Oaks High School|Thousand Oaks high school]] the last two.

At the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics|1999 World Championships]], Jones attempted to win four titles, but injured herself in the 200&nbsp;m after a gold in the 100&nbsp;m and a long jump bronze.\n\nAt the Sydney Olympics Jones finished with three gold medals (100 metre sprint, 200 metre sprint and 4x400 relay) and two bronze medals (long jump and 4x100 relay). However, she was later stripped of these medals after admitting that she had used [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. Her ex-husband Hunter, an Olympic [[Shot put|shot-putter]] and confessed steroid user, testified under oath that he had seen her inject drugs into her stomach in the [[Olympic Village]] in Sydney, which implicated baseball player [[Barry Bonds]], sprinters [[Tim Montgomery]], [[Chryste Gaines]], [[Kelli White]], and others, many of whom admitted to using illegal drugs while competing. Jones vehemently denied using performance-enhancing drugs until her confession in 2007.\n\nA dominant force in women's sprinting, Jones was upset in the 100&nbsp;m sprint at the [[2001 World Championships in Athletics|2001 World Championships]], as [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Zhanna Pintusevich-Block]] beat her for her first loss in the event in six years; Pintusevich-Block was one of the names revealed by [[Victor Conte]] during the BALCO scandals.

Jones promised that her latest defeat would not be the end of her Olympic efforts, and reasserted in May 2005 that winning a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics remained her \"ultimate goal.\"\n\nMay 2006 saw Jones run 11.06 at altitude but into a headwind in her season debut and beat [[Veronica Campbell]] and [[Lauryn Williams]] in subsequent 100&nbsp;m events. By July 8, 2006, Jones appeared to be in top form; she won the 100&nbsp;m sprint at [[Gaz de France]] with a time of 10.93&nbsp;seconds. It was her fastest time in almost four years. Three days later, Jones once more improved on her seasonal best time at the Rome IIAF Golden League (10.91&nbsp;seconds), but lost to [[Jamaica]]'s [[Sherone Simpson]], who clocked 10.87.\n\n====Personal bests====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Jones is profiled amongst other speed specialists including racing driver [[Lucas Luhr]], mountain biker [[Marla Streb]], and [[Stephen Murkett]], one of the designers of the [[Porsche Cayenne]].\n\n==Use of illicit performance-enhancing drugs==\nThroughout her entire athletic career\u2014even in high school\u2014Jones had been accused, either outright or by implication, of taking performance-enhancing drugs, a common allegation surrounding athletes involved in the sports under the \"Track and Field\" umbrella. Until 2007, Jones routinely denied\u2014in almost every way possible and in almost any venue where the question arose\u2014ever being involved with performance enhancers in any way, shape, or form. One of Jones's frequent statements in her own defense was that she had never tested positive for performance-enhancing substances; in her autobiography, she blamed the 2002 breakup of her marriage to [[C.J. Hunter]] in part on the fact that Hunter ''had'' tested positive for steroids four times before the 2000 Olympics, tainting her own drug-free image. However, the rumors and accusations that started when Jones missed a random drug test in high school in the early 1990s (Jones claimed she never received the letter notifying her of the required test; attorney [[Johnnie Cochran]] successfully got the four-year ban from track and field competition, the penalty for missing a random drug test, overturned)<ref name=fastestwoman /> continued to follow her through two Olympiads and several championship meets. Soon, a pattern of Jones choosing to train with both coaches and athletes who were also being dogged by rumors and accusations of performance-enhancing drugs began to emerge.\n\n===The BALCO investigation===\nOn December 3, 2004, [[Victor Conte]], the founder of [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]], appeared in an interview with [[Martin Bashir]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]''. In the interview, Conte told a national audience that he had personally given Jones four different illegal performance-enhancing drugs before, during, and after the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. In the course of investigative research, San Francisco based reporters [[Lance Williams]] and [[Mark Fainaru-Wada]] reported Jones had received banned drugs from BALCO, citing documentary evidence and testimony from Jones's ex-husband C.J. Hunter, who claims to have seen Jones inject herself in the stomach with the steroids.<ref name=Fainaru-Wada2006>{{cite book |last=Fainaru-Wada |first=M. |last2=Williams |first2=L. |title=Game of Shadows |publisher=Gotham Books |year=2006 |pages=234\u2013235}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hunter's 2004 testimony before a federal grand jury, Jones's use of banned drugs began well before Sydney.<ref name=Williams20060819>{{cite news |accessdate=2008-08-04 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/19/MNGBGKLP8H1.DTL&hw=marion+jones&sn=003&sc=976 |title=Sprinter Jones failed drug test |author=Williams, Lance |date=August 19, 2006 |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Hunter told the investigators that Jones first obtained [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] (Erythropoietin) from Graham, who Hunter said had a Mexican connection for the drug. Later, Hunter said, Graham met Conte, who began providing the coach with BALCO \"nutritional supplements\", which were actually an experimental class of \"designer\" steroids said to be undetectable by any drug screening procedures available at the time. Graham then distributed the performance enhancers to Jones and other Sprint Capitol athletes. Still later, Hunter told federal agents, Jones began receiving drugs directly from Conte.\n\nJones had never failed a drug test using the then-existing testing procedures, and insufficient evidence was found to bring charges regarding other untested performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n===2006 EPO tests===\n''[[The Washington Post]]'', citing unidentified sources with knowledge of drug results from the [[USA Track and Field]] Championships in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], reported that on June 23, 2006, an \"A\" sample of Marion Jones's urine tested positive for [[Erythropoietin]] (EPO), a banned performance enhancer. Jones withdrew from the [[Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich|Weltklasse Golden League]] meet in Switzerland, citing \"personal reasons\", and once more denied using performance-enhancing drugs. She retained lawyer [[Howard Jacobs]], who has represented many athletes in doping cases, including [[Tim Montgomery]] and cyclist [[Floyd Landis]]. On September 6, 2006, Jones's lawyers announced that her \"B\" sample had tested negative, which cleared her from the doping allegations.\n\n===Admission of lying during BALCO investigation===\nOn October 5, 2007, Jones admitted to lying to federal agents under oath about her use of steroids prior to the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and pleaded guilty at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]]).<ref name=NYT20071005 /> She confessed to Judge [[Kenneth M. Karas]] that she had made false statements regarding the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]] case and a check-fraud case.

In 2006, a bank foreclosed on her $2.5-million mansion near [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], where [[Michael Jordan]] was a neighbor. She was also forced to sell two other properties, including her mother's house, to raise money. In her prime, Jones was one of track's first female sports millionaires, typically earning between $70,000 and $80,000 a race, plus at least another $1 million from race bonuses and endorsement deals.\n\n===Alleged involvement in check fraud===\nIn July 2006, Jones was linked to a [[check fraud|check-counterfeiting scheme]] that led to criminal charges against her coach and ex-boyfriend Montgomery.<ref name=BankRecords /> Documents showed that a $25,000 check made out to Jones was deposited in her bank account as part of the alleged multimillion-dollar scheme. Prosecutors alleged that funds were sent to Jones's track coach, [[Steve Riddick]], in [[Virginia]], then funneled back to New York through a network of \"friends, relatives and associates.\"<ref name=BankRecords>{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/13848653/ |title=Bank records link Marion Jones to money scam |date=July 16, 2006 |agency=Associated Press |work=NBC Sports}}</ref> Riddick was arrested in February on [[money-laundering]] charges. According to the indictment and subsequent documents filed with the court, the link to Jones was made through one of Riddick's business partners, Nathaniel Alexander.\n\nOn October 5, 2007, Jones pleaded guilty to making false statements to IRS Special Agent [[Jeff Novitzky]] leading the ongoing BALCO investigation in California. Jones claimed she had never taken performance-enhancing drugs. \"That was a lie, your honor,\" she said from the defense table. The federal government, through grand juries, had been investigating steroid abuse since 2003.\n\nJones also pleaded guilty to making false statements about her knowledge of a check-cashing scheme to New York US Department of Homeland Security Special Agent Erik Rosenblatt, who has been leading a broad financial investigation that has already convicted the father of Jones's child, former world record holder and \"World's Fastest Man\" [[Tim Montgomery]], sports agent Charles Wells, and her coach, 1976 Olympic gold medalist [[Steve Riddick]].\n\n===Criminal sentencing===\n[[File:CarswellFMCFortWorthTX.jpg|thumb|[[Federal Medical Center, Carswell]], where Jones was incarcerated]]\nOn January 11, 2008, Marion Jones was sentenced to six months in jail resulting from her involvement in the check fraud case and her use of performance-enhancing drugs. She was ordered to surrender on March 11 to begin her jail term. Jones reported to the [[Federal Medical Center, Carswell]] prison facility in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] on March 7 and was assigned [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] register no. 84868-054.<ref name=AFP20080307 /> She was released from prison on September 5.<ref name=\"Released\" />\n\nIn legal filings prior to sentencing, lawyers for the defense requested US District Judge [[Kenneth Karas]] limit her penalty to probation and community service. Part of their argument was that Jones had been punished enough by apologizing publicly, retiring from track and field, and relinquishing her five Olympic medals. Lawyers for the prosecution had suggested any sentence between probation and six months would be fair (with the maximum penalty being five years in prison). Judge Karas sought advice as to whether he could go beyond the six month sentence suggested by the prosecution.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Judge Karas admonished Jones in the courtroom, stating that she knew what she was doing and would be punished accordingly.<ref name=Sentenced>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7182969.stm |title=Six-month jail sentence for Jones |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-01-11 |date=January 11, 2008}}</ref> \"The offences here are serious.

women's [[heptathlon]] as well as in the women's [[long jump]]. She won three gold, one silver, and two bronze [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medals, in those two events at four different Olympic Games. ''[[Sports Illustrated for Women]]'' magazine voted Joyner-Kersee the Greatest Female Athlete of All-Time, just ahead of [[Babe Didrikson Zaharias]].\n\nAfter retiring as a competitive athlete, Joyner-Kersee has been involved with many philanthropic efforts and has joined the Board of Directors for [[USA Track & Field]] (USATF), the national governing body of the sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatf.org/News/USATF-Board-welcomes-three-new-members.aspx |title=USA Track & Field - USATF Board welcomes three new members |publisher=Usatf.org |date=January 23, 2012 |accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nJoyner-Kersee is one of the most famous athletes to have overcome severe asthma.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/magazine/issues/fall11/articles/fall11pg9.html |title=Jackie Joyner-Kersee: Living with Asthma |date=Fall 2011 |volume = 6 |issue=3 |page = 9 |journal=MedlinePlus the Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJacqueline Joyner was born March 3, 1962, in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], and was named after [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Kennedy]]. As a high school athlete at [[East St. Louis Lincoln Senior High School]], she qualified for the finals in the long jump at the 1980 Olympic Trials, finishing 8th behind another high schooler, [[Carol Lewis]].<ref>Hyman, Richard S. (2008) [http://www.usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdf The History of the United State Olympic Trials Track & Field]. USA Track & Field</ref>  She was inspired to compete in multi-disciplinary track & field events after seeing a 1975 made-for-TV movie about [[Babe Zaharias|Babe Didrikson Zaharias]]. Interestingly, Didrikson, the trackster, basketball player, and pro golfer, was chosen the \"Greatest Female Athlete of the First Half of the 20th Century. Fifteen years later, \"[[Sports Illustrated for Women]]\" magazine voted Joyner-Kersee the greatest female athlete of \"all time\".\n\n===UCLA===\nJoyner-Kersee attended college at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]], where she starred in both track &  \nfield and in women's basketball from 1980-1985. She was a starter in her forward position for each of her first three seasons (1980\u201381, 81-82, and 82-83) as well as in her senior (fifth) year, 1984-1985. She had [[Redshirt (college sports)|red-shirted]] during the 1983-1984 academic year to concentrate on the heptathlon for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]].\n\nShe scored 1,167 points during her collegiate career, which places her 19th all time for the Bruins games.<ref name=\"UCLAMEDIA2009\">Usc Women's Basketball 2009-2010 Media guide - Copy available at UCLABRUINS.COM</ref> The Bruins advanced to the West Regional semi-finals of the [[1985 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament]] before losing to eventual runner-up Georgia.<ref name=\"UCLAMEDIA2009\" />\n\nShe was honored on February 21, 1998 as one of the 15 greatest players in UCLA women's basketball.<ref name=\"UCLAMEDIA\">UCLA Women's Basketball 2006-2007 Media guide - Copy available at UCLABRUINS.COM</ref> In April 2001, Joyner-Kersee was voted the \"Top Woman Collegiate Athlete of the Past 25 Years.\" The vote was conducted among the 976 NCAA member schools.<ref>[http://uclabruins.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/042501aaa.html Jackie Joyner-Kersee Is Named The 'Top Woman Collegiate Athlete Of The Past 25 Years], April 25, 2001. UCLA Bruins official Athletic site</ref>''\n\n==Competition==\n[[File:Jackie Joyner-Kersee 1989 Paraguay stamp.jpg|right|280px]]\n\n===1984 Summer Olympics===\n\nJoyner-Kersee competed in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles and won the silver medal in the [[heptathlon]]. She was the favorite heading into the event, but finished 5 points behind [[Australian]] [[Glynis Nunn]].\n\n===1986 Goodwill Games===\n\nJoyner-Kersee was the first woman to score over 7,000 points in a heptathlon event (during the 1986 [[Goodwill Games]]). In 1986, she received the [[James E. Sullivan Award]]   as the top amateur athlete in the United States.\n\n===1988 Summer Olympics===\n\nIn the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul, Korea]], Joyner-Kersee earned gold medals in both the heptathlon and the long jump. At the 1988 Games in Seoul, she set the still-standing heptathlon world record of 7,291 points. The silver and bronze medalists were [[Sabine John]] and [[Anke Vater-Behmer]], both of whom were representing [[East Germany]]. Five days later, Joyner-Kersee won her second gold medal, leaping to an Olympic record of {{convert|7.40|m|ftin|sp=us|frac=4|abbr=on}} in the long jump. She was the first American woman to earn a gold medal in long jump as well as the first American woman to earn a gold medal in heptathlon.\n\n===1991 World Championships===\n\nJoyner-Kersee was everyone's favorite to retain both her World titles earned four years earlier in Rome. However her challenge was dramatically halted when, having won the long jump easily with a {{convert|7.32|m|ftin|sp=us|frac=4|abbr=on}} jump no one would beat, she slipped on the take off board and careened head first into the pit, avoiding serious injury. She did, however, strain a hamstring, which led to her having to pull out of the heptathlon during the 200 m at the end of the first day.\n\n===1992 Summer Olympics===\n\nIn the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona, Spain]], Joyner-Kersee earned her second Olympic gold medal in the heptathlon.  She also won the bronze medal in the long jump which was won by her friend [[Heike Drechsler]] of [[Germany]].\n\n===1996 Summer Olympics===\n\nAt the Olympic Trials, Joyner-Kersee sustained an injury to her right hamstring. When the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] began, Joyner-Kersee was not fully recovered by the time the heptathlon started. After running the first event, the 100 m hurdles, the pain was unbearable and she withdrew. She was able to recover well enough to compete in the long jump and qualify for the final, but was in sixth place in the final with one jump remaining. Her final jump of {{convert|7.00|m|ftin|sp=us|frac=4|abbr=on}} was long enough for her to win the bronze medal. The Atlanta Olympics would be the last Olympics of Joyner-Kersee's long competitive career.\n\n===Professional Basketball Career===\n\nIn 1996 Joyner-Kersee signed on to play pro basketball for the [[Richmond Rage]] of the fledgling [[American Basketball League (1996-1998)|American Basketball League]].

While playing for her high school team, she was spotted by [[Tennessee State University|Tennessee State]] track and field coach [[Ed Temple]]. Being discovered by Temple was a major break for a young athlete. The day he saw the tenth grader for the first time, he knew he had found a natural athlete.

After these wins, she was being hailed throughout the world as \"the fastest woman in history\". Finally, on September 11, 1960, she combined with Tennessee State teammates [[Martha Hudson]], Lucinda Williams and Barbara Jones to win the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay in 44.5 seconds, setting a world record.<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/> Rudolph had a special, personal reason to hope for victory\u2014to pay tribute to [[Jesse Owens]], the celebrated American athlete who had been her inspiration, also the star of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Berlin]], Germany.<ref>Biracree (1988), p. 16</ref>\n\nFollowing the post-games European tour by the American team Rudolph returned home to Clarksville.
