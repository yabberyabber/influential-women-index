Around 10:30 am, Father Paschal offered [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] in her room and she received her last communion ([[Viaticum]]).

The Laura Ashley style is characterised by [[Romanticism|Romantic]] English designs \u2014 often with a 19th-century rural feel \u2014 and the use of natural fabrics.\n\n==Early life==\nAlthough her Welsh parents lived in [[London]], her mother returned home to allow '''Laura Mountney''' to be born in Wales at her grandmother's home, 31 Station Terrace, in [[Dowlais]], [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. She was raised in a [[civil service]] family as a [[Strict Baptist]]. The chapel she attended in Dowlais (Hebron) was [[Welsh language]] and although she could not understand it, she loved it, especially the singing. Educated at Marshall's School in Merthyr Tydfil until 1932, she was then sent to the Elmwood School, [[Croydon]]. She was evacuated back to Wales aged 13, but with so many [[World War II]] evacuees there were no school places left and she attended [[Aberdare]] Secretarial School.\n\nIn 1942, at age 16, she left school and served in the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]]. During this period she met engineer [[Bernard Ashley (businessman)|Bernard Ashley]] at a youth club in [[Wallington, London|Wallington]]. After the war, Bernard was posted to [[India]] with the [[Brigade of Gurkhas|Gurkhas]], and the pair corresponded by letter. From 1945 to 1952 she worked as a secretary for the [[Women's Institutes (British)|National Federation of Women's Institutes]] in London, marrying Bernard in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/halloffame/arts/laura_ashley.shtml |title=South East Wales Arts - Laura Ashley |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==The company==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}\n{{main|Laura Ashley plc}}\n[[File:1970s Laura Ashley dresses 07.jpg|thumb|350px|1970s printed cotton dresses by Laura Ashley exhibited at the [[Fashion Museum, Bath]] in 2013]]\nWhile working as a secretary and raising her first two children, Ashley undertook some development work for the Women's Institute on quilting. Revisiting the craft she had learnt with her grandmother, she began designing headscarves, napkins, table mats and tea-towels which Bernard printed on a machine he had designed in their attic flat at 83 Cambridge Street, [[Pimlico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~copestake/newsltr2.htm |title=Copestake and Mounteney Newsletter 2 |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe couple had invested \u00a310 in wood for the screen frame, dyes and a few yards of linen. Laura's inspiration to start producing printed fabric came from a [[Women's Institute]] display of traditional handicrafts at the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]. When Laura looked for small patches carrying Victorian designs to help her make patchworks, she found no such thing existed. Here was an opportunity, and she started to print Victorian style headscarves in 1953.\n\nThe scarves quickly became successful \u2013 retailing both via [[mail order]] and at high street chains such as [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] \u2013 and Bernard left his [[City of London|City]] job to print fabrics full-time.<ref>Walker, John.

''Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed.</ref> The company was originally registered as Ashley Mountney (Laura's maiden name), but Bernard changed the name to Laura Ashley because he felt a woman's name was more appropriate for the type of products they were producing. The new company moved to [[Kent]] in 1955, but when the third of their four children was born, the family moved to [[Wales]] in 1960.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Heritage at Laura Ashley|url = http://www.lauraashley.com/uk/about-laura-ashley/heritage/page/heritage|website = www.lauraashley.com|access-date = 2016-01-28}}</ref>\n\nLaura Ashley's first shop was opened at 35 Maengwyn Street, [[Machynlleth]], [[Montgomeryshire]], in 1961.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Laura Ashley 30 years on: Memories of the girl from Dowlais|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-34290383|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-28|first = Nicola Bryan BBC|last = News}}</ref> The Laura Ashley association is commemorated by a small plaque. The shop sold locally produced honey, walking sticks as well as the couple's own products. Here Laura worked with a seamstress to introduce their first forays into fashion, producing smock like shirts and gardening smocks. The family lived above the shop until moving to [[Carno]], [[Montgomeryshire]]. They first set up in the vacant social club, but moved in 1967 to the local railway station, which had been closed two years earlier.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Heritage at Laura Ashley|url = http://www.lauraashley.com/uk/about-laura-ashley/heritage/page/heritage|website = www.lauraashley.com|access-date = 2016-01-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Laura Ashley turned down the offer of an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (she was upset her husband had not been offered one despite his achievements in creating the company) and Bernard Ashley was knighted only after her death. The addition of a home in France enabled Laura to go back to her roots of fabric design and the company launched its home furnishings collections.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Personal life==\nLaura and Bernard Ashley had four children who were all involved with the business.

Bernard was the company chairman and Laura kept a close eye on fabrics. The astonishing success of what proved to be the ultimate cottage industry meant that the Ashleys could afford a yacht, a private plane, the French [[Ch\u00e2teau de Remaisnil]] in [[Picardy]], a town-house in [[Brussels]], and the villa ''Contenta'' in [[Lyford Cay]], New Providence, [[Bahamas]], later purchased for $8.5 million by T.

The following year, when she was 15,<ref name=\":0\"/> following a successful juvenile court petition for [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]], she moved into her own apartment.<ref name=\"People-Bio\"/>\n\nIn June 1988 after an evening of heavy drinking, Barrymore angrily confronted her mother. She began breaking dishes and glasses until her mother left. Shortly thereafter, a friend of Barrymore's and the friend's mother entered the house and whisked the actress into a waiting car. They took her to ASAP, a [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]] rehabilitation clinic, where she would remain for 12 days.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nAfter a break to film ''[[Far from Home (1989 film)|Far From Home]]'', Barrymore returned to Los Angeles and continued her therapy. Six days later, she boarded a plane for New York to audition for a play. Her stay in New York proved to be her downfall, as she found herself in a nightclub where cocaine was available. Barrymore wrongly believed that a small amount of cocaine would not jeopardize her steps toward recovery. One day later, she stole her mother's credit card and flew with a friend back to L.A., bought more cocaine, and went on an unauthorized shopping spree. Barrymore was quickly taken back to ASAP by private agents hired by her mother.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nBarrymore's second stay at the clinic was no more effective than the first. In March 1989, she went out to celebrate six months of sobriety. The friend she was with had a small amount of marijuana and Barrymore could not resist. She began feeling guilty over the fact that her mother was unaware of her return to drugs and their relationship deteriorated. In June 1989 Barrymore moved into an apartment with a friend and struggled with her depression, which would trigger a suicide attempt on July 4, 1989. Immediately after Barrymore slashed her wrists with a butcher knife, a friend entered the apartment and rushed her to the hospital. From there, she returned to ASAP for more treatment. At the urging of her counselors, she was released into the custody of [[David Crosby]] (of rock group [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] fame) and his wife, Jan Dance, in October 1989, both recovered drug abusers. One of Barrymore's counselors, a friend of Crosby and his wife, made the arrangement with hopes that a more supportive environment would help Drew finally kick her habits. Barrymore's mother also agreed to begin therapy to address her [[codependency]] with Drew and begin to foster a more positive and structured relationship with her daughter.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n[[File:Drew Barrymore Corey Feldman (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Barrymore with [[Corey Feldman]] at the 61st Academy Awards, March 29, 1989]]\nIn her late teens, her rebelliousness played itself out on screen and in print.

After finishing her primary education, she entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] before joining the [[Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise]].\n\nIn 1888, she gave up her career in the theatre to marry an up-and-coming young lawyer, Georges Laguerre. A friend and follower of the politically ambitious army general [[Georges Boulanger]], her husband introduced her to the world of radical politics and involved her in writing pamphlets for the \"Boulangists\" movement. However, the marriage was short-lived and in 1891 the couple separated after which Durand took a job writing for ''[[Le Figaro]]'', the leading newspaper of the day. In 1896, the paper sent her to cover the ''Congr\u00e8s F\u00e9ministe International'' (International Feminist Congress) ostensibly to write a humorous article. She came away from the event a greatly changed person, so much so that the following year on December 9, 1897 she founded a feminist daily newspaper, ''[[La_Fronde_(newspaper)|La Fronde]]'' to pick up where [[Hubertine Auclert]]'s ''[[La Citoyenne]]'' left off.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Mary Louise|title=Acting Up: The Feminist Theatrics of Marguerite Durand|journal=French Historical Studies|date=Autumn 1996|volume=19|issue=4|pages=1103\u20131138|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/286666|doi=10.2307/286666}}</ref>\n\nDurand's newspaper, run exclusively by women, advocated for women's rights, including admission to the [[Bar association]] and the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]]. As well, its editorials demanded women be allowed to be named to the [[Legion of Honor]] and  to participate in parliamentary debates. This included, later in 1910, Durand's  attempt to [[Community organizing|organize]] female candidates for the legislative elections. At the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|World's Fair]] in Paris, she organized the Congress For The Rights of Women. As well as establishing a summer residence for female journalists in [[Pierrefonds, Oise|Pierrefonds]] in the [[Picardy]] region, Durand turned to activism for working women, helping to organize several [[trade union]]s.\n\nMarguerite Durand, consumed by a passion for the equality of women, was an attractive woman of style and elegance who was famous for walking the streets of Paris with her pet lion she named \"Tiger.\" Instrumental in the establishing of the zoological [[Cimeti\u00e8re des Chiens]] in the Parisian suburb of [[Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine]] where her lion was eventually interred, her activism raised the profile of [[feminism in France]] and Europe to an unprecedented level of respectability. Along the way, she compiled an enormous collection of papers that she gave to the government in 1931. The following year, the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Marguerite Durand]] opened in Paris and remains to this day one of the best sources in the world for research into feminism and women's history.\n\nDetails of Marguerite Durand can be found in the English language in American Professor Mary Louise Roberts' 2002 book, ''Disruptive Acts: The New Woman in Fin-de-Si\u00e8cle France''. In the French language there is ''Marguerite Durand (1864-1936) \"La Fronde\" f\u00e9ministe ou \"Le Temps\"'' by [[Jean Rabaut]] published in 1996.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Durand, Marguerite}}\n[[Category:French stage actresses]]\n[[Category:French feminists]]\n[[Category:French journalists]]\n[[Category:French newspaper founders]]\n[[Category:French suffragists]]\n[[Category:Community activists]]\n[[Category:1864 births]]\n[[Category:1936 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century French actresses]]\n[[Category:Women company founders]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic feminists]]"}]},"46979848":{"pageid":46979848,"ns":0,"title":"Adele Duttweiler"},"40670265":{"pageid":40670265,"ns":0,"title":"Fifi Ejindu"},"47351672":{"pageid":47351672,"ns":0,"title":"Inger McCabe Elliott"},"1303431":{"pageid":1303431,"ns":0,"title":"Jeri Ellsworth","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox person\n|name        = Jeri Ellsworth\n|image       = You're_one_baaad_cat.jpg\n|image_size  = 225px\n|caption     = Jeri Ellsworth, 2008\n|birth_date  = {{Birth year and age|1974}}\n|birth_place = [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States<ref name=\"engadget.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/17/castar-augmented-reality/|title=castAR bets big on its augmented reality hardware with move to Silicon Valley|work=Engadget|first=Nicole|last=Lee|date=October 17, 2014|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref>\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|known_for   = [[Entrepreneur]] and [[autodidacticism|autodidact]] [[computer chip]] designer\n|occupation  = Inventor\n|nationality = American\n}}\n[[Image:Jeri Ellsworth at her store.jpg|thumb|right|Jeri Ellsworth stands in front of her store, Computers Made Easy, in December, 2000.]]\n\n'''Jeri Ellsworth''' (born 1974) is an American [[entrepreneur]] and [[autodidacticism|autodidact]] [[computer chip]] designer and inventor.

As a child, she persuaded her father to let her use a [[Commodore 64]] computer which had been originally purchased for her brother.  She taught herself to program by reading the C64's manuals.  While at high school, she drove [[dirt-track race cars]] with her father, and then began designing new models in his workshop, eventually selling her own custom race cars.  This allowed her to drop out of high school to continue the business.\n\nIn 1995, at the age of 21, she decided that she wanted to get away from the race car business,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLy0mVkoLio |title=Jeri Ellsworth, self-taught engineer, talks about her career|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> and she and a friend started an early [[Intel]] 486-PC-based business, assembling and selling computers.  When she and her partner <!-- who? --> later had a disagreement, Ellsworth opened a separate business in competition.

She dropped out due to a \"cultural mismatch\"; Ellsworth said that questioning professors' answers was frowned upon.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nIn 2000, Ellsworth attended her first Commodore exposition, where she unveiled a prototype video expansion for the C64.  This project later evolved to become the CommodoreOne, a.k.a. the [[C-One]], and [[C64 Direct-to-TV|C64-DTV]], and a video on YouTube \"Expo Jeri 1st\". Ellsworth then began designing computer circuits that mimicked the behavior of her first computer, the Commodore 64.  In 2002, she designed the chip used in the [[C-One]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c64upgra.de |title=C-One website |publisher=C64upgra.de |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> as an enhanced Commodore 64 which could also emulate other home computers of the early 1980s, including the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] and [[Sinclair ZX81]]. She and her fellow developer displayed the C-One at a technology conference, which led to Ellsworth receiving a job offer from Mammoth Toys, which hired her to design the \"computer in a chip\" for the Commodore-emulating joystick. She began the project in June 2004 and had the project ready to ship by that Christmas.  It sold over a half-million units, in the USA, Europe, and elsewhere.\n[[File:2009 Bay Area Maker Faire - Jeri.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Autodidact computer programmer Jeri Ellsworth at a 2009 Bay Area \"Maker Faire\" conference.]]\nFrom December 2008 until March 2009, Ellsworth hosted a weekly [[webcast]], ''Fatman and Circuit Girl'', together with [[George Sanger (musician)|George Sanger]].<ref name=\"Webcast1\">{{cite web|url=http://makezine.com/2009/04/28/latest-fatman-and-circuit-girl-vids/|title=Latest Fatman and Circuit Girl vids|last1=Branwyn|first1=Gareth|authorlink1=Gareth Branwyn|date=28 April 2009|publisher=[[Make (magazine)|Make]]|accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Webcast2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycresistor.com/2009/06/25/fatman-and-circuit-girl-jeri-ellesworth-rollerderby-superstar-cover-noahs-ar-rig-at-notacon/|title=Fatman and Circuit Girl (Jeri Ellsworth - Rollerderby Superstar) Cover Noah\u2019s AR Rig at Notacon|last1=Joyce|first1=Matt|date=25 June 2009|publisher=[[NYC Resistor]]|accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> On May 30, 2009, Ellsworth demonstrated her Home Chip Lab at [[Maker Faire]] Bay Area 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/2545 |title=Events filled with DIY projects, science, demos, recycling, entertainment, and fun |publisher=Makerfaire.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> Ellsworth was named \"MacGyver of the Day\" on February 25, 2010 by [[Lifehacker]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Torrone | first = Phil | date = February 25, 2010 | url = http://lifehacker.com/5480199/macgyver-of-the-day-electronics-hacker-jeri-ellsworth | title = MacGyver of the Day: Electronics Hacker Jeri Ellsworth | publisher = Lifehacker.com}}</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 2010 she released information on how to build a TSA \"naked\" scanner using repurposed satellite antenna parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hackaday.com/2010/12/03/make-your-own-tsa-naked-scanner/ |title=Make Your Own TSA \"Naked\" Scanner |publisher=Hack a Day |date=December 3, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> Ellsworth has published numerous technical articles online regarding subjects as diverse as homemade semiconductors (2009), homemade electroluminescent (EL) displays (2010), EL phosphor manufacture from common ingredients and ways to make transparent EL backplanes without using expensive indium-tin-oxide coated glass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/06/jeri-ellsworth-turns-an-lcd-into-el.html |title=Make: Online &#124; Jeri Ellsworth turns an LCD into an EL display |publisher=Blog.makezine.com |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>\n\nEllsworth was a keynote speaker at the Embedded Systems Conference on May 5, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLy0mVkoLio|title=Jeri Ellsworth, self-taught engineer, talks about her career|work=YouTube|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Ellsworth has made significant contributions to ongoing work on [[DIY]] transistors in relation to rapid prototyping as well as thick film fabrication of EL displays using off the shelf chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} In early 2012 Ellsworth and several other notable hardware hackers were hired by [[Valve Corporation]] to work on gaming hardware.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.valvetime.net/threads/im-working-at-valve-on-nextgen-gaming-hardware-jeri-ellsworth.187331/ | title = \"I'm working at Valve on nextgen gaming hardware\" - Jeri Ellsworth | publisher = valvetime.net }}</ref> Along with several other Valve employees, Ellsworth was dismissed the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jeriellsworth/status/301521067816669184|title=Jeri Ellsworth on Twitter: \"Yup.

She said that Americans had the right idea; they didn't get into a rut.

She served two, three-year mayoral terms, making a priority of downtown revitalization, heritage preservation, economic development, neighbourhood protection, protecting the environment, international relations, trade corridors' infrastructure, family values and anti-poverty initiatives.\n\n==Pioneer roots in London==\n\nHaskett was born and raised in London's Kensal Park district north of Springbank Drive, a descendant of the pioneer Haskett family, one of the early Irish Protestant settlers in London and area, dating back to 1818.\n\n==Education==\n\nHaskett earned her B.A. from the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1974, her LL.B. from the [[University of Western Ontario]] in 1977, her LL.M. from the [[London School of Economics]] in 1979 and a second LLM from [[The George Washington University Law School]] in 2005.She has also studied law at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and the Institute for Advanced Legal Studies at [[Cambridge University]], England.\n\nShe later founded her own law firm, Haskett Menear & Associates, which grew to include seven lawyers.\n\n==Mayor==\n\nFrom 1991-1994, Haskett was a member of London's elected board of control on city council.\n\nOnce Haskett was elected mayor in November 1994, beating Deputy-Mayor Jack Burghardt by slightly more than 1,000 votes, she stepped aside from her duties as a lawyer and as a partner in her law firm. She was re-elected in 1997 with a landslide victory.\n\n===Proclamation controversy===\nIn 1995, Dianne Haskett refused to issue a [[Gay Pride]] Proclamation on the basis that she'd previously formulated a policy of declining controversial proclamations. London City Council also declined to issue the Gay Pride Proclamation by a vote of 13-5 (Mayor Haskett abstained from voting).\n\nRichard Hudler, president of the Homophile Association of London, Ontario (HALO), filed an official complaint with the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]] in 1995, a tribunal of which ultimately determined in 1997 after a three-day public hearing that the City of London and Mayor Haskett had discriminated against HALO in the provision of a municipal service. Both the City of London and Haskett were fined $5,000.\n\nHaskett placed a paid advertisement in [[The London Free Press]] on October 22, 1997, in which she stated that she believed the human rights case was unfairly decided and wrong in fact and law, and that the Tribunal's decision undermined the freedoms guaranteed in the [[Canadian Constitution]], notably [[freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of religion]].\n\nAs an act of protest, she withdrew from her duties as mayor for three weeks (without pay) by staying in her [[Port Stanley, Ontario]], townhouse and did not campaign during the last three weeks of the 1997 election. Deputy Mayor Grant Hopcroft, who became acting mayor during her absence, became an ardent supporter of issuing the gay pride  proclamation after opposing it in 1995 in a recorded vote and refused to allow an appeal of the tribunal decision. Haskett was re-elected to a second term as mayor by a 2-1 landslide over Hopcroft.  Haskett used no campaign signs during the 1997 civic election, instead using green-and-gold ribbons.[http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/1997/November/11/default.htm][http://www.realwomenca.com/newsletter/1997_Nov_Dec/article_6.html]\n\nIn 1996, Haskett  was invited to bring greetings at an evangelical Christian rally in London called the \"March of Jesus\". One of the speakers was Rev. Miguel Sanchez of the London Gospel Temple, who prayed for deliverance \"from the darkness and deception of the spirit of [[Islam]]\". Haskett bowed her head during the prayer, and later said, \"From what I know of him, I believed Rev. Sanchez and all other participants have a great love for all people\".<ref>T. Sher Singh, \"Let's minimize our bigotry and maximize our humanity\" [opinion piece], ''Toronto Star'', 1 July 1996, A13.</ref> She later described Sanchez's comments as unfortunate. Haskett's role in this event was strongly criticized at the time by some members of London's Muslim community.<ref>[http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/Local/2006/10/19/2068060-sun.html Chip Martin, \"Troops marshalling\"], ''London Free Press'', 19 October 2006, accessed 22 October 2006.</ref> In an effort to make sure that Londoners of all faiths felt appreciated and respected in the city, Haskett participated in a March for Tolerance from downtown to the London Muslim Mosque on Oxford Street West, where community leaders, including Haskett, addressed the crowd. She thanked the Muslim community for the many positive contributions they made to the city and urged people of all faiths to show love and respect for one another.\n\n==Moves to Washington, D.C.==\n\nHaskett's second, three-year term as mayor ended in December 2000 after she decided not to run again for re-election. She was succeeded by deputy mayor [[Anne Marie DeCicco-Best]]. Haskett, her husband and daughter moved to [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Virginia]], working with two D.C. area law firms in planning and implementing strategic business development and providing assistance in their immigration and estate planning work.\n\nHaskett completed her second Master's Law Degree in the Spring of 2005 from The [[George Washington University Law School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. She also passed the Washington D.C. Bar exam and was sworn in as an attorney and member of the D.C. Bar in December, 2005.\n\nHaskett has also been involved in a number of other projects in the Washington, D.C. area, including speechwriting, research and marketing and acting in an advisory capacity in Senate and Congressional campaigns. She volunteered as a communications adviser and researcher for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Elizabeth Dole]].<ref>Gloria Galloway, \"Controversial ex-mayor seeking Tory nomination\", ''Globe and Mail'', 19 October 2006, A6.</ref>  She sat as a member of the Board of Trustees for the [[International Center for Religion & Diplomacy]] in Washington, D.C. and of [[Trinity Christian School, Virginia|Trinity Christian School]] of Fairfax, Virginia.\n\n== 2006 federal by-election ==\n\nOn October 17, 2006, 1290-[[CJBK]]-AM, a [[London, Ontario]] radio station, and the A-Channel reported that Dianne Haskett had returned to London to seek the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] nomination in the [[London North Centre]] federal riding recently vacated by former Liberal MP [[Joe Fontana]], who was a candidate for mayor of London in civic election 2006.  This information was confirmed by Haskett on October 18, 2006.\n\nOn October 24, Haskett defeated [[Tom Weihmayr]] for the Conservative nomination in the federal riding of London North-Centre. Haskett was widely considered to be the choice of the party hierarchy.

A year later, they married. The couple had seven children together.\n\n==Business==\nThe Ilitches founded [[Little Caesars Pizza]] in 1959, which they expanded as a franchise. They have since expanded their interests to include restaurants, entertainment, sports and gaming.\n\n==Casinos and Indian gaming==\nOne of the original investors in Detroit's [[MotorCity Casino]], Ilitch realized an opportunity to purchase total interest in the casino resort complex from various minor stakeholders and [[Mandalay Resort Group]] in 2005.  Michigan gaming laws prohibit one company from owning more than one Detroit casino property. With Ilitch as owner, MotorCity Casino is reportedly one of the largest independently owned casino enterprises in the United States\u2014likely the largest woman-owned casino in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.macombdaily.com/stories/041305/bus_ilitch001.shtml ], ''Macomb Daily'', 13 April 2005</ref>\n\nIlitch and a partner, [[Michael J. Malik, Sr.]], have pursued other [[Indian gaming|casino gambling]] interests outside of Detroit, and from coast to coast. They have acted as a developer of casinos for [[federally recognized tribes]] of Native Americans, who have started to use this as a means of generating revenues. They have worked with the [[Little River Band of Ottawa Indians]], developing [[Little River Casino Resort]] in [[Manistee, Michigan]]. Ilitch has partnered with the [[Shinnecock Indian Nation]] in [[Hampton Bays, New York]] on plans to develop a casino on Long Island.

It includes Little Caesars Pizza, Blue Line Foodservice Distribution, Little Caesars Pizza Kit Fundraising Program, Champion Foods, [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Detroit Tigers]], Olympia Entertainment, Olympia Development and various food service and entertainment venues within these businesses.\n\nThe [[Detroit Red Wings]] have won four [[Stanley Cup]]s in ice hockey: 1997, 1998, 2002, and 2008, under Ilitch family ownership.  Marian Ilitch and three daughters are among only 12 women to have had their names engraved on the trophy.\n\nMike Ilitch's [[Detroit Tigers]], a baseball team, logged losing records in 12 out of 13 seasons but turned the team around in 2006.

Ilitch Holdings, Inc. manages the stadium and parking.\n\n== Investing in the Community ==\nGiving back to the community is Ilitch's trademark. Like most projects developed and owned by Ilitch, the MotorCity Casino is actively involved in the community; it contributed about $1 million to local charity groups in Detroit.\n\nIn 1985, Ilitch and her husband established the Little Caesars Love Kitchen Foundation, which consists of a mobile pizza restaurant. The Love Kitchen has fed more than 2 million people, aiding the hungry and disaster victims across the U.S. and Canada.

However, this was a manufactured corporate legend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/supp/2006/anniversary/032706-routerman.html?t5 |title=Router man |publisher=Networkworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref><ref name=pdp10>{{cite news |title=A start-up's true tale |author=Pete Carey |url=http://pdp10.nocrew.org/docs/cisco.html |work=[[Mercury News]] |date=2001-01-12 }}</ref>  In fact, both systems (SU-SCORE and SU-GSB) were [[TOPS-20]] systems.  The systems were the same and therefore obviously not incompatible, but the SU-GSB system was not on any network. It has also been noted that the original router was designed and created by a group of people at Stanford, both students and faculty, rather than Lerner and Bosack alone.<ref name=pdp10/>\n\nLerner and Bosack brought in [[John Morgridge]] to be the third CEO of Cisco in 1988.  On August 28, 1990, Lerner was fired; upon hearing the news, Bosack resigned to show his support for her. The two sold all of their stock for $170 million<ref name=Nicholls>{{cite news |last=Nicholls|first=Walter |title=Two Starts and a Stir |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/21/AR2005062100655_pf.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=22 June 2005|accessdate=10 June 2016}}</ref> and retired from Cisco.\n\n==Later projects==\nLerner and Bosask divorced in the early 1990s. \n\nLerner placed a portion of her stock earnings into a start-up [[venture capital]] [[limited partnership]] called \"& Capital Partners.\" One of the companies it funded was [[Urban Decay (cosmetics)|Urban Decay]] Cosmetics, with the tag line \"does pink make you puke?\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Does pink make you puke? |url=http://www.forbes.com/archive/forbes/1997/0825/6004058a.html;jsessionid=x2WoMGNVwn-StErE?token=MyBBcHIgMjAwNiAwNTo0MjoyMCArMDAwMA%3D%3D |work=[[Forbes]] |date=August 25, 1997 }}</ref> <ref>[http://www.urbandecay.com/about.cfm \"Urban Decay history\"]</ref> In February 2000, [[Moet-Hennessy]] [[Louis Vuitton]] ([[LVMH]]), the French [[luxury goods]] conglomerate, acquired the firm.

The house still stands.\n\nLerner is involved in a number of high-tech and philanthropic activities.  In 1992, through the foundation she shares with Leonard Bosack, she invested money into the restoration of [[Chawton House]], the [[manor house]] in the English county of [[Hampshire]] that had been owned by [[Jane Austen]]'s brother, [[Edward Austen Knight]].  Chawton House opened in 2003 as  the Centre for the Study of Early Women's Writing, 1600-1830. The [[Chawton House Library]] has a collection of over 9,000 books, mainly related to the [[literary genre]] of [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]], and original [[manuscript]]s. The Library works in partnership with the [[University of Southampton]], and provides an important resource for the university's [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 18th Century Study.<ref>[http://www.chawtonhouse.org/education/southampton.html Chawton House Website Southampton Section]</ref> Lerner was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] by Southampton in recognition of this work\n\nShe started moving to Virginia in 1995.

The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in [[Manhattan]]. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and ''[[Oklahoma!]]''. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a ''Golden Musicals of Broadway'', which toured Europe for five months.

The Murray's publications were ''[[The Chinook]]'' in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the ''[[Bridge River-Lillooet News]]'' in [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]] and the ''[[Alaska Highway News]]'' in [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]].\n\nA Kansas farm girl made good and known for her spicy wit, backcountry wisdom, and down-to-earth style, \"Ma\" was co-founder and editor (with her husband George) of the ''[[Bridge River-Lillooet News]]'', the ''[[Alaska Highway News]]'' and other publications.  Her editorials were famously signed off with the catchphrase \"And that's fer damshur!\".\n\n==Kansas to Canada==\nBorn Margaret Theresa Lally in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to Irish immigrants, Margaret was raised on rural [[Kansas]] farmland in the United States, largely in poverty. She came to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] en route to [[Calgary, Alberta]], where she hoped to find herself a cowboy to wed (she had worked in a saddle factory in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and she and her sister, Bess, had corresponded with cowboys who had written in response to the notes they had tucked into the most expensive saddles being shipped north.\n\n==\"Ye Ed\" and her publisher-husband==\nFinding work as a secretary and office manager for and soon after marrying [[Orange-Canadian]] establishment scion and junior publisher [[George Matheson Murray|George Murray]] in spite of their religious differences (she was an ardent [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]\u2014and madly in love with George\u2014her entire life).  She won continent-wide fame for some of her columns - either because she had a point, or because they were downright funny, and often coarse - or at least matter-of-fact.  The Murrays also launched various lesser known publications including ''Country Life In British Columbia'', a popular magazine for rural women, and ''The Chinook'', which was George's first venture upon his coming to BC from Ottawa, where he had worked as junior columnist for the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' and apprenticed in politics under [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]].\n\n==Politics==\nBoth had a high profile in provincial politics.  George, already a bright, articulate and somewhat visionary star in the BC Liberal Party, was a popular MLA from his arrival in Lillooet until his electoral demise in 1941.  Both Murrays had taken a strong stand in print in favour of the miners striking in the Bridge River, and alienated not only prime advertisers but also some of George's political backers; and by the time of the election most of the striking men had gone away to war; merchants without them as customers were also unwilling to support the Murrays.  George was squeezed out of office in 1945 in a narrow race with his old rival [[Ernest Crawford Carson]], of the pioneer-stock [[Pavilion, British Columbia|Pavilion]] Carsons of the famous [[Diamond S]].  Faced with a disappeared revenue stream for their paper and George without a seat in the House - it was time to leave town, and the Murrays, always indefatigable, knew where they wanted to go, and off they went.\n\n==North to the Alaska Highway==\nBoth she and George were vocal proponents of the [[Alaska Highway]] and excitedly moved to the instant city of [[Fort Saint John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]] to chronicle its birth at the launching of construction on the mammoth project and launched their ''[[Alaska Highway News]]'' upon arrival.  The account of this experience in ''The Newspapering Murrays'' vividly documents the wild times and of that instant [[boomtown]] at its birth, and exposes much of the material waste that went into the U.S. military's building of the highway.  The ''[[Alaska Highway News]]'' was just as spicy as its Lillooet counterpart, and it is from that paper that a much-syndicated (even to ''The New York Times'') advice about \"not flushing for no. 1, but save the flushing for no. 2\" comes from. She was one of the locals interviewed in the [[National Film Board of Canada]] short \"People of the Peace\" (1958).[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259498/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1]\n\n==Ma's character==\nDespite her country background and being uneducated\u2014though widely read\u2014Ma had astute business and management sense, if not exactly political acuity, and her penny-trimming skills dragged both company and family (and husband) through bad times.  Her sharp tongue was legendary but her office was known for having an open door to any who dropped by, and she was a relentless self-promoter and Lillooet-booster and a devoted newspaperwoman to the bitter end.  Also not likely to back down from a verbal fight.\n\n==George in and out of Parliament==\nIn 1949 George ran successfully for [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Cariboo]] riding, which included [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], but lost in 1953 when the candidate for the rising forces of [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit]] in B.C. edged out Murray, in part thanks to the third-party split from the CCF candidate.  Complicating the race was that Ma had decided to run for the legislature (in the same election, but for a different party - [[Social Credit Party of British Columbia|Social Credit]], no less, and without telling him first, then switching to a fringe party, the \"Common Herd\" or People Party, in the riding of [[North Peace River]]).  She's already had a high profile political career as an editorialist, and was often a social embarrassment to her husband (who still loved her deeply nonetheless).  Ma withdrew from the race, but the damage was done.  George was shamed out of politics and, by now an outsider in revolt from the Liberal-Conservative Coalition and unwilling to join league with Bennett's Socreds, he gave up on his political career and retired from the House of Commons, returning to being publisher and grandfather only.\n\nGeorge died in 1961, but Ma survived him by 21 years, and continued to run and publish the paper after his death - and to raise eyebrows with her editorials, and laughter with her speeches and frank opinions.  Ma but spent her last days back at the editors' desk in historic [[Lillooet, British Columbia]], churning out her raunchy wit and lusty language until the very last, continuing to write a column now and then even after her retirement as editor.\n\nMa Murray was survived by her daughter, Georgina.

Pickford was one of the earliest stars to be billed under her name (film stars up until that time were usually unbilled), and was one of the most popular actresses of the 1910s and '20s, earning the nickname \"Queen of the Movies\".\n\nPickford was awarded the second ever [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her first sound film role in ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]'' (1929) and also received an [[Academy Honorary Award|honorary Academy Award]] in 1976. In consideration of her contributions to [[American cinema]], the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Pickford as 24th in its 1999 list of [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|greatest female stars]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood Cinema]].\n\n==Early life==\nMary Pickford was born Gladys Louise Smith in 1892 (although she would later claim 1893 or 1894 as her year of birth) at 211 University Avenue,{{ref|A|A}} [[Toronto]], [[Ontario, Canada]].<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/> Her father, John Charles Smith, was the son of English [[Methodism|Methodist]] immigrants, and worked a variety of odd jobs. Her mother, [[Charlotte Hennessey]], was of [[Irish Catholic]] descent and worked for a time as a seamstress. She had two younger siblings, [[Lottie Pickford|Charlotte, called \"Lottie\"]] (born 1893), and [[Jack Pickford|John Charles, called \"Jack\"]] (born 1896), who also became actors. To please her husband's relatives, Pickford's mother baptized her children as Methodists, the faith of their father. John Charles Smith was an alcoholic; he abandoned the family and died on February 11, 1898, from a fatal blood clot caused by a workplace accident when he was a [[purser]] with Niagara Steamship.<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/>\n\nWhen Gladys was age four, her household was under infectious quarantine, a public health measure. Their devoutly Catholic maternal grandmother (Catherine Faeley Hennessey) asked a visiting Roman Catholic priest to baptize the children. Pickford was at this time baptized as Gladys Marie Smith.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Kevin Brownlow|quote=I was baptized Gladys Marie by a French priest \u2014 Gladys Marie Smith.

One of these was a theatrical stage manager.<!-- name?? -->  At his suggestion, Gladys (age 7) was given two small roles, one as a boy and the other as a girl,<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/> in a stock company production of ''[[The Silver King (play)|The Silver King]]'' at Toronto's Princess Theatre. She subsequently acted in many melodramas with Toronto's Valentine Company, finally playing the major child role in their version of ''The Silver King''. She capped her short career in Toronto with the starring role of Little Eva in their production of ''[[Tom show|Uncle Tom's Cabin]],'' adapted from the 1852 novel by American writer and abolitionist [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Mary Pickford 1916.jpg|right|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1916]]\nBy the early 1900s, theatre had become a family enterprise. Gladys, her mother and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays. After six impoverished years, Pickford allowed one more summer to land a leading role on Broadway, planning to quit acting if she failed. In 1906 Gladys, Lottie and Jack Smith supported singer [[Chauncey Olcott]] on Broadway in ''Edmund Burke''.<ref>''Pictorial History of the American Theatre 1860\u20131985'' by Daniel C. Blum, c. 1985</ref> Gladys  finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (play)|The Warrens of Virginia]]''. The play was written by [[William C. deMille]], whose brother, [[Cecil B. DeMille|Cecil]], appeared in the cast. [[David Belasco]], the producer of the play, insisted that Gladys Smith assume the stage name Mary Pickford.<ref name=\"filmbug\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Filmbug.|url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/342424|publisher=Filmbug|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref> After completing the Broadway run and touring the play, however, Pickford was again out of work.\n\nOn April 19, 1909, the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]] director [[D. W. Griffith]] screen-tested her at the company's New York studio for a role in the [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] film, ''[[Pippa Passes]]''. The role went to someone else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford's single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week.<ref>Mary Pickford, ''Sunshine and Shadow'', Doubleday & Co., 1955, p. 10.</ref>\n\nPickford, like all actors at Biograph, played both bit parts and leading roles, including mothers, ingenues, [[Charwoman|charwomen]], spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford said of her success at Biograph:<blockquote>\"I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I'd become known, and there would be a demand for my work.\"</blockquote> She appeared in 51 films in 1909 \u2013 almost one a week. She also introduced her friend [[Florence La Badie]] to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie's career.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles. Many other film companies wintered on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], escaping the weak light and short days that hampered winter shooting in the [[East Coast of the United States|East]]. Pickford added to her 1909 Biographs (''Sweet and Twenty'', ''They Would Elope,'' and ''To Save Her Soul'', to name a few) with films made in California.\n\nActors were not listed in the credits in Griffith's company. Audiences noticed and identified Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance. Exhibitors in turn capitalized on her popularity by advertising on [[sandwich board]]s that a film featuring \"The Girl with the Golden Curls\", \"Blondilocks\", or \"The Biograph Girl\" was inside.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Golden Silents.|url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/marypickford.html|publisher=Golden Silents.com|accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nPickford left Biograph in December 1910. The following year, she starred in films at [[Carl Laemmle]]'s [[Independent Moving Pictures|Independent Moving Pictures Company]] (IMP). IMP was absorbed into [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford returned to work with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as ''Friends'', ''The Mender of Nets'', ''Just Like a Woman'', and ''[[The Female of the Species (1912 film)|The Female of the Species]]''. That year Pickford also introduced [[Dorothy Gish|Dorothy]] and [[Lillian Gish]] (both friends from her days in touring melodrama) to Griffith.<ref name=\"Whitfield\">Whitfield, Eileen: ''Pickford: the Woman Who Made Hollywood'' (1997), pp. 8, 25, 28, 115, 125, 126, 131, 300, 376. [[University Press of Kentucky]]; ISBN 0-8131-2045-4</ref> Both became major silent stars, in comedy and tragedy, respectively. Pickford made her last Biograph picture, ''[[The New York Hat]],'' in late 1912.\n\nShe returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of ''[[A Good Little Devil]]'' (1912). This was a major turning point in her career. Pickford, who had always hoped to conquer the Broadway stage, discovered how deeply she missed film acting. In  1913, she decided to work exclusively in film. The previous year, [[Adolph Zukor]] had formed [[Famous Players Film Company|Famous Players in Famous Plays]]. It was later known as [[Famous Players-Lasky]] and then [[Paramount Pictures]], one of the first American feature film companies.\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford with camera2.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1916]]\nPickford left the stage to join Zukor's roster of stars. Zukor believed film's potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of ''A Good Little Devil''. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play's Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called \"one of the worst [features] I ever made ... it was deadly\".<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/> Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.\n\nPickford's work in material written for the camera by that time had attracted a strong following. Comedy-dramas, such as ''[[In the Bishop's Carriage]]'' (1913), ''[[Caprice (1913 film)|Caprice]]'' (1913), and especially ''[[Hearts Adrift]]'' (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers. ''Hearts Adrift'' was so popular that Pickford asked for the first of her many publicized pay raises based on the profits and reviews.<ref name=\"Kevin Brownlow\">{{cite book|last1=Brownlow|first1=Kevin|title=Mary Pickford Rediscovered|date=May 1, 1999|publisher=Harry N.

Each enjoyed a level of fame far exceeding that of other actors. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pickford was believed to be the most famous woman in the world, or, as a silent-film journalist described her, \"the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history.\"<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/>\n\n===Stardom===\n[[File:Mary Pickford-Ziegfeld.jpg|right|thumb||Mary Pickford, 1920]] Pickford starred in 52 features throughout her career.

Pickford's fans were devoted to these \"Little Girl\" roles, but they were not typical of her career.<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/>\n\nIn August 1918, Pickford's contract expired and, when refusing Zukor's terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business.

Pickford had already cut her hair in the wake of her mother's death in 1928.

Like most movie stars of the silent era, Pickford found her career fading as [[Sound film|talkies]] became more popular among audiences.<ref name=\"mdecline\"/>\n\nHer next film, ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1929 film)|The Taming of The Shrew]]'', made with husband [[Douglas Fairbanks]], was not well received at the box office.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_fairbanks.html \"Douglas Fairbanks profile\"], pbs.org; accessed May 19, 2014.</ref> Established Hollywood actors were panicked by the impending arrival of the talkies. On March 29, 1928, ''The Dodge Brothers Hour'' was broadcast from Pickford's bungalow, featuring Fairbanks, Chaplin, [[Norma Talmadge]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[John Barrymore]], [[D.W. Griffith]], and [[Dolores del Rio]], among others.

In 1933, Pickford underwent a [[Technicolor]] screen test for an animated/live action film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', but [[Walt Disney]] discarded the project when [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] released its own version of the book. Only one Technicolor [[Film still|still]]<!-- or is this [[still frame]]? --> of her screen test still exists. She retired from acting in 1933; her last acting film was released in 1934. She continued to produce for others, however, including ''[[Sleep, My Love]]'' (1948; with [[Claudette Colbert]]) and ''[[Love Happy]]'' (1949), with the [[Marx Brothers]]).<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/>\n\n===The film industry===\n[[File:MaryPickfordHoover.gif|right|thumb|Mary Pickford giving President [[Herbert Hoover]] a ticket for a film industry benefit for the unemployed, 1931]]\nPickford used her stature in the movie industry to promote a variety of causes. Although her image depicted fragility and innocence, Pickford proved to be a worthy businesswoman who took control of her career in a cutthroat industry.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities|last=McDonald|first=Paul|publisher=Wallflower|year=2000|isbn=978-1-903364-02-4|location=London, UK|page=33}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], she promoted the sale of [[Liberty Bond]]s, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches that kicked off in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Theda Bara]], and [[Marie Dressler]]. Five days later she spoke on [[Wall Street]] to an estimated 50,000 people. Though Canadian-born, she was a powerful symbol of [[Americana]], kissing the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] for cameras and auctioning one of her world-famous curls for $15,000. In a single speech in Chicago she sold an estimated five million dollars' worth of bonds. She was christened the U.S. Navy's official \"Little Sister\"; the Army named two cannons after her and made her an honorary colonel.<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/>\n\nAt the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the [[Motion Picture & Television Fund|Motion Picture Relief Fund]], an organization to help financially needy actors. Leftover funds from her work selling Liberty Bonds were put toward its creation, and in 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was officially incorporated, with [[Joseph Schenck]] voted its first president and Pickford its vice president. In 1932, Pickford spearheaded the \"Payroll Pledge Program\", a payroll-deduction plan for studio workers who gave one half of one percent of their earnings to the MPRF. As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country House and Hospital]], in [[Woodland Hills, California]].<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/>\n\nAn astute businesswoman, Pickford became her own producer within three years of her start in features. According to her Foundation, \"she oversaw every aspect of the making of her films, from hiring talent and crew to overseeing the script, the shooting, the editing, to the final release and promotion of each project.\" She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor's Famous Players In Famous Plays (later Paramount). Zukor acquiesced to her refusal to participate in block-booking, the widespread practice of forcing an exhibitor to show a bad film of the studio's choosing to also be able to show a Pickford film. In 1916, Pickford's films were distributed, singly, through a special distribution unit called Artcraft. The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford's motion-picture production company.<ref name=\"ushistory\"/>\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford signing the entrance to the Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow, 1943]]\nIn 1919, she increased her power by co-founding [[United Artists]] (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA's creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company's movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return they put up with what many considered creative interference.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nUnited Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]]. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford's acting career had largely faded.<ref name=\"mdecline\"/> After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for three million dollars.<ref name=\"ushistory\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford biography|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3890.html|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Mary Pickford portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Pickford, 1921]]\nPickford was married three times. She married [[Owen Moore]], an Irish-born silent film actor, on January 7, 1911. It is rumored she became pregnant by Moore in the early 1910s and had a [[miscarriage]] or an [[abortion]]. Some accounts suggest this resulted in her later inability to have children.<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/> The couple had numerous marital problems, notably Moore's alcoholism, insecurity about living in the shadow of Pickford's fame, and bouts of [[domestic violence]].

They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple. The couple's triumphant return to Hollywood was witnessed by vast crowds who turned out to hail them at railway stations across the United States.\n\n''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and a series of other swashbucklers gave the popular Fairbanks a more romantic, heroic image. Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door. Even at private parties, people instinctively stood up when Pickford entered a room; she and her husband were often referred to as \"Hollywood royalty\". Their international reputations were broad. Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the [[White House]] often asked if they could also visit [[Pickfair]], the couple's mansion in Beverly Hills.<ref name=\"filmbug\"/>\n\nDinners at Pickfair included a number of notable guests.

The public nature of Pickford's second marriage strained it to the breaking point. Both she and Fairbanks had little time off from producing and acting in their films. They were also constantly on display as America's unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches. When their film careers both began to flounder at the end of the silent era, Fairbanks' restless nature prompted him to overseas travel (something which Pickford did not enjoy). When Fairbanks' romance with [[Sylvia Ashley|Sylvia, Lady Ashley]] became public in the early 1930s, he and Pickford separated. They divorced January 10, 1936. Fairbanks' son by his first wife, [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], claimed his father and Pickford long regretted their inability to reconcile.<ref name=\"Whitfield\"/>\n\nOn June 24, 1937, Pickford married her third and last husband, actor and [[band leader]] [[Charles 'Buddy' Rogers|Buddy Rogers]]. They [[adoption|adopted]] two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). As a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[American Experience]]'' documentary noted, Pickford's relationship with her children was tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that \"Things didn't work out that much, you know. But I'll never forget her. I think that she was a good woman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_rogers.html|title=Buddy Rogers, Mary Pickford and Their Children|accessdate=August 26, 2007|publisher=[[American Experience]]}}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Mary Pickford 1934.JPG|thumb|right|Mary Pickford in ''Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove'' (1934), her only film appearance in Technicolor]]\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford became an alcoholic, as her father had been. Her mother Charlotte died of breast cancer in March 1928. Her siblings, Lottie and Jack, both died of alcohol-related causes. These deaths, her divorce from Fairbanks, and the end of silent films left Pickford deeply depressed. Her relationship with her children, Roxanne and Ronald, was turbulent at best. Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from [[Lillian Gish]], her stepson [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], and few other people. She appeared in court in 1959, in a matter pertaining to her co-ownership of North Carolina TV station [[WSJS-TV]]. The court date coincided with the date of her 67th birthday; under oath, when asked to give her age, Pickford replied, \"I'm 21, going on 20\".<ref>\"Mary Pickford \"Going On 20\" (Or Is It 66?)\", ''The Ottawa Citizen'', April 11, 1959, p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Pickford often received visitors only by telephone, speaking to them from her bedroom.

After graduating from Phillips Academy, Pratt enrolled at [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio]], where she received a degree in [[Communication studies|Communications]] with a minor in [[Modern dance]]. Her publishing career began with internships at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and ''Sportstyle,'' a Fairchild Publication. After graduating, Pratt landed her first job as assistant editor of ''[[McCall's]]'' and in 1986, became an associate editor of ''Teenage Magazine''. From there she went on to found ''Sassy Magazine''.\n\n==Career==\n\n===''Sassy''===\n{{main|Sassy (magazine)|l1=Sassy}}\nAt the age of 24, Pratt became the founding editor of ''[[Sassy Magazine|Sassy]]'', a magazine for teenage girls. Under Pratt, the magazine experienced rapid circulation growth. The magazine's hipness factor increased dramatically when it issued a limited-edition [[Sonic Youth]] [[flexi-disc]] (a cover of the [[New York Dolls]] \"Personality Crisis\") and it became known that band members [[Thurston Moore]] and [[Kim Gordon]] were fans of the teen magazine.\n\nThe magazine's affinity for [[indie rock]] led to the formation of the band Chia Pet, which counted Sassy writer Christina Kelly and Pratt as members. Chia Pet released \"Blind Date\" on the Kokopop label in 1992, which won simultaneous Single of the Week honors in both ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Melody Maker]]''.\n\n===Television and books===\nThe success of ''Sassy'' led Pratt to host talk shows on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[Lifetime Television|Lifetime]]. Pratt was also a frequent contributor to [[VH-1]] and ''[[Extra (TV series)|Extra]]'', where she was featured interviewing such personalities as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M.]], and [[Drew Barrymore]].\n\nPratt is the author of two books, ''For Real: The Uncensored Truth About America's Teenagers'' (Hyperion, September 1995) and ''Beyond Beauty: Girls Speak Out on Looks, Style and Stereotypes'', which is published by Callaway Editions in association with Clarkson Potter.\n\n===''Jane''===\n{{main|Jane (magazine)|l1=Jane}}\nAfter ''Sassy'' was bought by [[Los Angeles]]-based Peterson Publishing in 1994, the [[New York]]-based Pratt regrouped with several former ''Sassy'' staffers to form ''Jane'', a lifestyle magazine for 18- to 34-year-old women which debuted three years later. Its first cover featured actress [[Drew Barrymore]]. Other colleagues have included singer [[Michael Stipe]], whom she dated; director [[Spike Jonze]], whom she hired as editor of short-lived teenage-boy-targeted ''Dirt'' magazine; actress [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], who was once a summer intern at ''Sassy''; and [[Pamela Anderson]], who wrote a regular monthly column for ''Jane''.\n\n''Jane'' was nominated for a [[National Magazine Award]] for General Excellence by the American Society of Magazine Editors, and Pratt was named \"Editor of the Year\" in 2002 by ''[[Adweek]]''.\n\nOn July 25, 2005, Pratt announced that she was resigning from her position as editor-in-chief of ''Jane'' and would be leaving the company on September 30, 2005, exactly eight years after its debut issue. Circulation had steadily increased since the magazine's debut, with 700,000 readers as of the day Pratt announced she would be stepping down.\n\nOn July 9, 2007, Charles Townsend, President and CEO of [[Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications]], announced that ''Jane'' magazine would cease publication with its August 2007 issue. The magazine's website, www.janemag.com, was also to be shut down. \"This was a very difficult decision for us,\" Mr. Townsend said. \"We worked diligently to make ''Jane'' a success.

She was also the cousin of [[Ruth Rappaport]]'s mother.<ref name=\"ushmm1\">{{cite web|url=http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn42274|title=Oral history interview with Ruth Rappaport - USHMM Collections Search|publisher=collections.ushmm.org|accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\n==Move to Australia==\nDiminutive at 4&nbsp;ft. 10&nbsp;in. (147&nbsp;cm), Rubinstein emigrated from Poland to Australia in 1902, with no money and little English.  Her stylish clothes and milky complexion did not pass unnoticed among the town's ladies, however, and she soon found enthusiastic buyers for the jars of beauty cream in her luggage. She spotted a market where she began to make her own. Fortunately for Rubinstein, a key ingredient of the cream, lanolin, was readily at hand.\n\n[[Coleraine, Victoria|Coleraine]], in the Western Victoria region, where her uncle was a shopkeeper, might have been an \"awful place\" but was home to some 75 million [[Sheep]], that secreted abundant quantities of a grease, chemically known as [[lanolin]]. These sheep were the wealth of the nation and the Western District's vast mobs of merinos produced the finest wool in the land. To disguise the lanolin's pungent odour, Rubinstein experimented with [[lavender]], [[pine bark]] and [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]].\n\nRubinstein had a falling out with her uncle, but after a stint as a bush governess, began waitressing at the Winter Garden tearooms in Melbourne. There, she found an admirer willing to stump up the funds to launch her Cr\u00e8me Valaze, supposedly including herbs imported \"from the [[Carpathian Mountains]]\". Costing ten pence and selling for six shillings, it walked off the shelves as fast as she could pack it in pots. Known to her customers only as Helena, Rubinstein could soon afford to open a salon in fashionable [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], selling glamour as a science to clients whose skin was \"diagnosed\" and a suitable treatment \"prescribed\".\n\nSydney was next, and within five years Australian operations were profitable enough to finance a Salon de Beaut\u00e9 Valaze in [[London]]. As such, Rubinstein formed one of the world's first cosmetic companies. Her business enterprise proved immensely successful and later in life, she used her enormous wealth to support charitable institutions in the fields of education, art and health.\n\nRubinstein rapidly expanded her operation. In 1908, her sister Ceska assumed the Melbourne shop's operation, when, with $100,000, Rubinstein moved to London and began what was to become an international enterprise. (Women at this time could not obtain bank loans, so the money was her own.)\n\n==Marriage and children==\n\nIn 1908, she married the Polish-born American journalist Edward William Titus in London. They had two sons, Roy Valentine Titus (London, December 12, 1909\u2013New York, June 18, 1989) and Horace Titus (London, April 23, 1912\u2013New York, May 18, 1958). They eventually moved to Paris where she opened a salon in 1912. Her husband helped with writing the [[publicity]] and set up a small publishing house, published ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' and hired [[Samuel Putnam]] to translate famous model [[Alice Prin|Kiki]]'s memoirs.\n\nRubinstein threw lavish dinner parties and became known for apocryphal quips, such as when an intoxicated French ambassador expressed vitriol toward [[Edith Sitwell]] and her brother [[Sacheverell Sitwell|Sacheverell]]: \"Vos anc\u00eatres ont br\u00fbl\u00e9 Jeanne d'Arc!\" Rubinstein, who knew little French, asked a guest what the ambassador had said. \"He said, 'Your ancestors burned [[Joan of Arc]].'\" Rubinstein replied, \"Well, someone had to do it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Higgins|first=Patrick |title=''Madame: An Intimate Biography of Helena Rubinstein''|publisher=Viking Press|year=1971|pages= 17}}</ref>\n\nAt another ''f\u00eate'', [[Marcel Proust]] asked her what makeup a duchess might wear. She summarily dismissed him because \"he smelt of mothballs.\" Rubinstein recollected later, \"How was I to know he was going to be famous?\"<ref name=city-journal>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/14_3_urbanities-czarinas.html|title=''The Czarinas of Beauty''|last=Kanfer|first=Stefan |publisher=city-journal.org|accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref>\n\n==Move to the United States==\n[[File:Helena Rubinstein by Paul C\u00e9sar Helleu (1859-1927) cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Helena Rubinstein by [[Paul C\u00e9sar Helleu]] (1908)]]\n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]], she and Titus moved to [[New York City]], where she opened a cosmetics salon in 1915, the forerunner of a chain throughout the country. This was the beginning of her vicious rivalry with the other great lady of the cosmetics industry, [[Elizabeth Arden]]. Both Rubinstein and Arden, who died within 18 months of each other, were social climbers. And they were both keenly aware of effective marketing and luxurious packaging, the attraction of beauticians in neat uniforms, the value of celebrity endorsements, the perceived [[Value-based pricing|value of overpricing]] and the promotion of the [[pseudoscience]] of skincare.\n\nFrom 1917, Rubinstein took on the manufacturing and wholesale distribution of her products. The \"Day of Beauty\" in the various salons became a great success. The purported portrait of Rubinstein in her advertising was of a middle-age mannequin with a Gentile appearance.\n\nIn 1928, she sold the American business to [[Lehman Brothers]] for $7.3 million, ($88 million in 2007). After the arrival of the [[Great Depression]], she bought back the nearly worthless stock for less than $1 million and eventually turned the shares into values of multimillion dollars, establishing salons and outlets in almost a dozen U.S. cities. Her subsequent spa at 715 Fifth Avenue included a restaurant, a gymnasium and rugs by painter [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. She commissioned artist [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] to design a powder compact as well a portrait of herself.\n\n===Divorce and remarriage===\n\nFreed of her former marriage vows, in 1938 Helena readily married Prince Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia (1895\u20131955), whose somewhat clouded materlineal claim to [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] nobility, as that of Prince Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia (sometimes spelled Courielli-Tchkonia; born in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], February 18, 1895, died in [[New York City]] November 21, 1955), stemmed from his having been born a member of the untitled noble Tchkonia family of [[Guria]], enticing the ambitious young man to appropriate the genuine title of his grandmother, born Princess Gourielli.\n\nSelf-styled Prince Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia was 23 years younger than Rubinstein. Eager for a regal title to call her own, Rubinstein pursued the handsome youth avidly, coming to name a male cosmetics line after her youthful prized catch. Some have claimed that the marriage was a marketing ploy, including Rubinstein's being able to pass herself off as Helena Princess Gourielli.<ref>''Mrs. Astor and the Gilded Age''</ref>\n\nA multimillionaire of contrasts, Rubinstein took a bag lunch to work and was very frugal in many matters, but bought top-fashion clothing and valuable fine art and furniture. Concerning art, she founded the respectable Helena Rubinstein Pavilion of Contemporary Art in [[Tel Aviv]] and in 1957 she established the Helena Rubinstein travelling art scholarship in Australia.<ref name=\"adb\">{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110484b.htm|title=Rubinstein, Helena (1870\u20131965)|last=Poynter|first=J.

She knew how to advertise\u2014using 'fear copy with a bit of blah-blah'\u2014 and introduced the concept of 'problem' skin types. She also pioneered the use of pseudo-science in marketing, donning a lab coat in many advertisements, despite the fact that her only training had been a two-month tour of European skin-care facilities. She knew how to manipulate consumers' status anxiety, as well: If a product faltered initially, she would hike the price to raise the perceived value.\"<ref name=Graham>Ruth Graham, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704754304576096532209518142.html?mod=googlenews_wsj \"More Than Skin Deep]\", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' February 5, 2011.

She was the first black woman [[publisher]] in North America and the first woman publisher in [[Canada]].<ref name=Freeman>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/archival-records/interloan/provincial-freeman.aspx |title=The Provincial Freeman |publisher=Archives of Ontario |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126000215/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/archival-records/interloan/provincial-freeman.aspx |archivedate=January 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nShadd Cary was an abolitionist who became the first female African American newspaper editor in North America when she edited the ''Provincial Freeman'' in 1853.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Ann Shadd Cary|url=http://www.biography.com/people/mary-ann-shadd-cary-214141|publisher=A&E Networks Television|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Daniel G|title=The Black press|journal=Polyphony: The Bulletin of the Multicultural History Society of Ontario|date=Spring\u2013Summer 1982|volume=4|issue=1|page=43|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=3770562|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMary Ann Shadd was born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] on October 9, 1823, the eldest of thirteen children of Abraham Doras Shadd (1801\u201382) and Harriet Burton Parnell. Abraham D. Shadd was a grandson of Hans Schad, alias John Shadd, a native of [[Hesse-Cassel]] who had entered the [[United States]] serving as a [[Hessian soldier]] with the British Army during the [[French and Indian War]]. The story goes that Hans Schad was wounded and left in the care of two [[African-American]] women, mother and daughter, both named Elizabeth Jackson. The Hessian soldier and the daughter were married in January 1756 and their first son was born six months later.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott P |url=http://mchhistory.blogspot.com/2010/07/abraham-doras-shadd.html |title=Abraham Doras Shadd |publisher=The Mill Creek Hundred History Blog |date=July 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA.D. Shadd was a son of Jeremiah Shadd, John's younger son, who was a Wilmington [[butcher]]. Abraham Shadd was trained as a [[shoemaker]]<ref name=hmdb>{{cite web|title=Mary Ann Shadd Cary|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=57756|website=Historical Marker Database|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref> and had a shop in Wilmington and later in the nearby town of  [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]]. In both places he was active as a conductor on the [[Underground Railroad]] and in other civil rights activities, being an active member of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], and, in 1833, named President of the National Convention for the Improvement of Free People of Colour.<ref>{{cite web |first=Gail |last=Ito |title=Shadd, Abraham Doras (1801-1882) |url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/shadd-abraham-doras-1801-1882 |publisher=BlackPast.org}}</ref>\n\nWhen it became illegal to educate African American children in the state of Delaware, the Shadd family moved to Pennsylvania, where Mary attended a Quaker school. In 1840, after being away at school, Mary Ann returned to West Chester and established a school for black children. She also later taught in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]], and [[New York City]].\n\nThree years after the passage of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], A. D. Shadd moved his family to [[Canada]], settling in [[North Buxton, Ontario]]. In 1858, he became the first black man to be elected to political office in Canada, when he was elected to the position of Counselor of [[Raleigh Township, Ontario]].\n\n==Social activism==\n{{Library resources box|by=yes|onlinebooksby=yes|viaf=59931033}}\nWhen the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] in the [[United States]] threatened to return free northern blacks and escaped [[slavery|slaves]] into bondage, Shadd and her brother Isaac moved to Canada and settled in [[Windsor, Ontario]], across the border from Detroit. In Windsor, she founded a racially integrated school with the support of the [[American Missionary Association]]. She ran an anti-slavery newspaper called ''The Provincial Freeman,'' which made her the first female editor in North America.<ref name=hmdb /> Isaac managed the daily business affairs of the newspaper, and would go on to host gatherings to plan the raid on [[Harper's Ferry]] at his home.\n\nMary Ann traveled around Canada and the United States advocating for full racial integration through education and self-reliance. She promoted emigration to Canada amongst freemen, publishing ''A Plea for Emigration; or Notes of Canada West, in Its Moral, Social and Political Aspect: with Suggestions respecting Mexico, West Indies and Vancouver's Island for the Information of Colored Emigrants'' in 1852.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior |title=Aboard the Underground Railroad - Mary Ann Shadd Cary House |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/dc2.htm}}</ref>\n\nShe attempted to participate in the 1855 Philadelphia Colored Convention, but the assembly debated whether to even let her sit as a delegate. Her advocacy of emigration made her a controversial figure and she was only admitted by a slim margin of 15 votes. According to [[Frederick Douglass]]'s Paper, although she gave a speech at the Convention advocating for emigration, she was so well-received that the delegates voted to give her ten more minutes to speak. However, her presence at the Convention was largely elided from the minutes, likely because she was a woman.<ref>The Elevator, \"The National Colored Convention,\" 1869.</ref>\n\n==Civil War and postbellum activism==\n[[File:Mary Ann Shadd Cary House.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Mary Ann Shadd Cary House]] in Washington, D.C.]]\nIn 1856, she married Thomas F.

After the Civil War, she taught in black schools in Wilmington, before moving to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she taught in public schools and attended [[Howard University School of Law]]. She graduated as a lawyer at the age of 60 in 1883, becoming only the second black woman in the United States to earn a law degree.<ref name=hmdb /> She wrote for the newspapers ''National Era'' and ''The People's Advocate'' and in 1880, organized the Colored Women's Progressive Franchise.\n\nShadd Cary joined the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]], working alongside [[Susan B.

She became known for her artwork, giving one-woman shows of oil paintings, watercolors, and pastels. This artwork was adapted and licensed, starting about 1968, by [[Hallmark Cards]] (a manufacturer of paper products) and by Bloomcraft (a textile manufacturer), and Vanderbilt began designing specifically for linens, pottery, and glassware.\n\n===Theater arts===\nFrom 1954 to 1963, Vanderbilt applied herself to acting. (Her first stage vehicle, ''The Swan,'' inspired the logo she later used as a fashion designer.) During this time in her life, she appeared in a number of live and filmed television dramas including ''[[Playhouse 90]],'' ''[[Studio One in Hollywood]],'' and ''[[The Dick Powell Show]].'' She also made an appearance in a two part episode of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' in 1981. Other TV programs on which she appeared include ''[[Person to Person]]'' with [[Edward R. Murrow]], ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]],'' ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]],'' ''[[Live! with Kelly and Michael]],'' and ''CBS News Sunday Morning.''\n\n===Fashion modeling===\nVanderbilt was also a top international fashion model. Beginning with the custody trial during her childhood, appearing at age 17 in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]],'' being the public face of her clothing and fragrances lines, and noted for having inspired [[Richard Avedon]], she has been a popular subject for photographers her entire life.\n\n===From fashion model to fashion designer===\nDuring the 1970s, Vanderbilt ventured into the fashion business, first with Glentex, licensing her name for a line of scarves. In 1976, Indian designer '''Mohan Murjani's''' Murjani Corporation, proposed launching a line of [[designer jeans]] carrying Vanderbilt's signature embroidered on the back pocket, as well as her swan logo. Her jeans were more tightly fitted than other jeans of that time. The logo eventually appeared on dresses and perfumes, while Vanderbilt also launched a line of blouses, sheets, shoes, leather goods, liqueurs, and accessories. Vanderbilt was one of the first designers to make public appearances, which was a difficult thing for her because of her shyness.\n\nIn 1978, Vanderbilt sold the rights to her name to the Murjani Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.murjanigroup.com|title=Murjani Group - Powering International Lifestyle Brands|work=Murjani Group}}</ref> She then launched her own company, \"GV Ltd.,\" on 7th Avenue in New York. In the period from 1982 to 2002, [[L'Oreal]] launched eight fragrances under the brand name ''Gloria Vanderbilt.''<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fragrantica.com/designers/Gloria-Vanderbilt.html |title= Gloria Vanderbilt Fragrances |work= Fragrantica}}</ref>  [[The Jones Group|Jones Apparel Group]] acquired the rights to Gloria Vanderbilt jeans in 2002.\n\n====Fraud trial====\nBut in the 1980s, Vanderbilt accused her former partners in GV Ltd. and her lawyer of fraud. After a lengthy trial (during which time the lawyer died) Vanderbilt won and was awarded nearly $1.7 million, but the money was never recovered, though she was also awarded $300,000 by the New York Bar Association from its Victims of Fraud fund. Worse yet, Vanderbilt now owed millions in back taxes, since the lawyer had never paid the IRS, and thus she was forced to sell her Southampton and New York City homes.\n\n===Art exhibitions===\nIn 2001, Vanderbilt opened her first art exhibition, \"Dream Boxes,\" at the Southern Vermont Arts Center in Manchester; it was a critical success. She launched another exhibition of 35 paintings at the Arts Center in 2007. Two years later, she returned to the Arts Center as a panelist at its Annual Fall Show Exhibition, signing copies of her latest novel, ''Obsession: An Erotic Tale.''\n\n===Writings===\nVanderbilt had written four volumes of memoirs and three novels (including ''Obsession: An Erotic Tale,'' mentioned above) as of late May 2016, and she also regularly contributed to ''The New York Times,'' ''Vanity Fair,'' and ''Elle.''<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/148141.Gloria_Vanderbilt |title= Gloria Vanderbilt (Author of 'It Seemed Important at the Time') |publisher= Goodreads.com |date= January 3, 2013 |accessdate= March 7, 2013}}</ref> In November 2010, Vanderbilt was the subject of a new book chronicling her life, titled ''The World of Gloria Vanderbilt,''<ref>{{cite book |last= Goodman |first= Wendy |year= 2010 |title= The World of Gloria Vanderbilt  |location= New York |publisher= Abrams |isbn= 978-0810995925 |others= Cooper, Anderson (forward)}}</ref> written by Wendy Goodman, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'s'' design editor.

While many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for President of the United States, some have questioned that priority given issues with the legality of her run. They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35.  However, election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue.  The presidential inauguration was in March 1873. Woodhull's 35th birthday was in September 1873.\n\nAn activist for women's rights and labor reforms, Woodhull was also an advocate of [[free love]], by which she meant the freedom to marry, divorce, and bear children without government interference.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/free-love-advocate-victoria-woodhull-excited-bloomington/article_2c2cb275-b36e-5a6a-bc6a-dd4821121900.html |title= \u2018Free love\u2019 advocate Victoria Woodhull excited Bloomington |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= 2016-11-15 |accessdate= 2016-04-13 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}</ref>\n\nWoodhull twice went from [[rags to riches]], her first fortune being made on the road as a highly successful [[Magnet therapy|magnetic healer]]<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 46\">Johnson, 1956, p. 46</ref> before she joined the [[spiritualist]] movement in the 1870s.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 46-47\">Johnson, 1956, p. 46-47</ref> While authorship of many of her articles is disputed (many of her speeches on these topics were collaborations between Woodhull, her backers, and her second husband, Colonel [[James Blood]]<ref>Johnson, 1956, p. 86, p. 87</ref>), her role as a representative of these movements was powerful. Together with her sister, [[Tennessee Claflin]], she was the first woman to operate a [[brokerage firm]] on [[Wall Street]]; they were among the first women to found a newspaper, ''Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly'', which began publication in 1870.<ref>''[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]'', a weekly newspaper founded by [[Susan B.

Woodhull was the candidate in 1872 from the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]], supporting women's suffrage and equal rights. Her arrest on [[obscenity]] charges a few days before the [[United States presidential election, 1872|election]], for publishing an account of the alleged adulterous affair between the prominent minister [[Henry Ward Beecher]] and Elizabeth Tilton, added to the sensational coverage of her candidacy. She did not receive any electoral votes, and there is conflicting evidence about popular votes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  While she didn't receive any electoral votes, she did receive some popular votes.  An unrelated man in Texas admitted to voting for her in 1872. He said he was casting his vote against Grant. Since votes cast for her appear to have not been counted, it can't be determined how many votes she received, but it was more than none. Biographer M.M.

She was beaten, starved and sexually abused by her father when still very young. She believed in [[spiritualism]] - she referred to \"Banquo's Ghost\" from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' - because it gave her belief in a better life.  She said that she was guided in 1868 by [[Demosthenes]] to what symbolism to use supporting her theories of Free Love.<ref>Goldsmith,</ref>\n\nAs they grew older, Victoria became close to her sister, [[Tennessee Celeste Claflin]] (called Tennie), seven years her junior and the last child born to the family. As adults they collaborated in founding a stock brokerage and newspaper in New York City.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 45\"/>\n\nBy age 11, Woodhull had only three years of formal education, but her teachers found her to be extremely intelligent.  She was forced to leave school and home with her family when her father, after having \"insured it heavily,\"<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 46\"/> burned the family's rotting [[gristmill]].

Her family had consulted him to treat the girl for a chronic illness.  Woodhull practiced medicine in Ohio at a time when the state did not require formal medical education and licensing. By some accounts, Woodhull claimed to be the nephew of [[Caleb Smith Woodhull]], [[List of mayors of New York City|mayor of New York City]] from 1849 to 1851; he was a distant cousin.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThey were married on November 20, 1853.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gabriel |first=Mary|title=Notorious Victoria|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill |year=1998 |isbn=1-56512-132-5|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1-17962-14094-44?cc=1614804|title=\"Ohio, County Marriages, 1789-2013, index and images, FamilySearch \"Marriage records 1849-1854 vol 5 > image 273 of 334; county courthouses, Ohio|publisher=familysearch.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-09}}</ref> Their marriage certificate was recorded in [[Cleveland]] on November 23, 1853, when Victoria was two months past her 15th birthday.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 46\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Underhill |first=Lois Beachy |title=The Woman Who Ran for President: The Many Lives of Victoria Woodhull |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1996 |isbn=0-14-025638-5 |page=24}}</ref>\nShe soon learned that her new husband was an [[alcoholic]] and a womanizer.

After their children were born, Victoria divorced her husband and kept his surname.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 46-47\"/><!-- Presumably the reference is the different version; hence arguing the case. -->\n\n===Second marriage===\nAfter the Civil War there were 10 million spiritualists in \"the bosom of the lord\".  About 1866<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p.47\">Johnson, 1956, p. 47</ref> Woodhull married [[Colonel James Blood|Colonel James Harvey Blood]], who also was marrying for a second time.  He had served in the [[Union Army]] in [[Missouri]] during the [[American Civil War]], and had been elected as city auditor of [[Saint Louis, Missouri]].\n\n===Free love===\nWoodhull's support of [[free love]] likely started after she discovered the infidelity of her first husband Canning. Women who married in the [[United States]] during the 19th century were bound into the unions, even if loveless, with few options to escape. [[Divorce]] was limited by law and considered socially scandalous. Women who divorced were stigmatized and often ostracized by society. Victoria Woodhull concluded that women should have the choice to leave unbearable marriages.<ref>Dubois and Dumenil, //Through Women's Eyes: An American History with Documents//. (Bedford; St. Martin's, 2012)</ref>\n\nWoodhull believed in monogamous relationships, although she also said she had the right to change her mind: the choice to make love or not was in every case the woman's choice (since this would place her in an equal status to the man, who had the capacity to rape and physically overcome a woman, whereas a woman did not have that capacity with respect to a man).<ref>[http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/IntercourseII.html Andrea Dworkin (1987). ''Intercourse,''Chapter 7: \"Occupation/Collaboration\"].</ref>\nWoodhull said:\n<blockquote>To woman, by nature, belongs the right of sexual determination. When the instinct is aroused in her, then and then only should commerce follow. When woman rises from sexual slavery to sexual freedom, into the [[self-ownership|ownership and control of her sexual organs]], and man is obliged to respect this freedom, then will this instinct become pure and holy; then will woman be raised from the iniquity and morbidness in which she now wallows for existence, and the intensity and glory of her creative functions be increased a hundred-fold . . .<ref>\"And the truth shall make you free.\" A speech on the principles of social freedom, delivered in Steinway hall, Nov. 20, 1871, by Victoria C.

I have an inalienable, constitutional and natural right to love whom I may, to love as long or as short a period as I can; to change that love every day if I please, and with that right neither you nor any law you can frame have any right to interfere.\"<ref>Speech is discussed and linked to also in Shearer, Mary L. \"Abandoned Woman? A Review of the Evidence.\"  http://www.victoria-woodhull.com/prostitute.htm</ref></blockquote>\n\nWoodhull railed against the hypocrisy of society's tolerating married men who had [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]es and engaged in other sexual dalliances. In 1872, Woodhull publicly criticized well-known clergyman [[Henry Ward Beecher]] for adultery. Beecher was known to have had an affair with his parishioner, Elizabeth Tilton, who had confessed to it, and the scandal was covered nationally. Woodhull was prosecuted on obscenity charges for sending accounts of the affair through the federal mails, and was briefly jailed. This added to sensational coverage during her campaign that fall for the United States presidency.<ref>DuBois and Dumenil. //Through Women's Eyes: An American History with Documents//. (Bedford; St Martin's, 2012)</ref>\n\n===Prostitution rumors and stance===\nWoodhull and her sister [[Tennessee Claflin]] traveled to New York City by railroad, entering a burgeoning city of exploding population and gangsterism on Stoop Hill. On the streets the open sewers competed with horse manure for the stench. The rich intermingled with poor on Broadway in Manhattan; prostitutes rubbing shoulders with the 'haves,' who included the richest American citizen, [[Commodore Vanderbilt]], railroad proprietor and millionaire.\n\nVictoria took [[laudanum]] while visiting the brothels on 5th Avenue.  She lived on Great Jones Street.  Most of the 20,000 prostitutes in New York lived on Green Street.  She circulated, managing to pick up an income of $20,000 from her liaisons with Vanderbilt.  Vanderbilt proposed marriage to her sister Tennessee Claflin, but his family was utterly opposed to it.<ref name=\"Shearer\">Shearer, Mary L. \"Frequently Asked Questions about Victoria Woodhull.\"  http://www.victoria-woodhull.com/faq.htm#who</ref> These rumors were said to have come from articles reported by the ''[[Chicago Mail]],'' but Shearer says that no such articles have been found.<ref name=\"Shearer\" /> She spoke out in person against prostitution, and considered marriage for material gain a form of it. But in her journal, ''Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly,'' Woodhull expressed support for the [[legalization of sex work]].<ref name=\"Shearer\" />  A personal account from one of Colonel Blood's friends suggests that Woodhull's sister Tennie was held against her will in a brothel until Woodhull rescued her; but this story remains unconfirmed.<ref name=\"Shearer\" />\n\n==Careers==\n\n===Stockbroker===\n[[File:Victoria-Woodhull-by-Mathew-Brady-c1870.png|thumb|right|[[Cabinet card]] of Woodhull by [[Mathew Brady]]]]\n\nWoodhull, with sister Tennessee (Tennie) Claflin, became the first women [[stockbroker]]s and in 1870 they opened a [[brokerage firm]] on [[Wall Street]].  Woodhull, Claflin & Company opened in 1870, with the assistance of the wealthy [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], an admirer of Woodhull's skills as a medium; he is rumoured to have been her sister Tennie's lover, and to have seriously considered marrying her.<ref>Johnson (1956), p.86</ref>  Woodhull made a fortune on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] by advising clients like Vanderbilt.  On one occasion she told him to sell his shares short for 150 cents per stock, which he duly followed, and earned millions on the deal.  Newspapers such as the ''[[New York Herald]]'' hailed Woodhull and Claflin as \"the Queens of Finance\" and \"the Bewitching Brokers.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://interactive.ancestry.com/7689/NEWS-NY-NE_YO_HE.1870_01_22_0007/456185863?backurl=http%253a%252f%252fsearch.ancestry.com%252fcgi-bin%252fsse.dll%253fdb%253dNEWS-NY-NE_YO_HE%2526gss%253dsfs28_ms_db%2526new%253d1%2526rank%253d1%2526msT%253d1%2526gskw%253d%252522The%252bQueens%252bof%252bFinance%252522%2526MSAV%253d1%2526uidh%253dzm2&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnSearchResults&rc=1592,146,1670,213;1696,146,1853,213;1879,146,1931,213;1957,146,2166,213|title=Please wait...|website=interactive.ancestry.com|access-date=2016-04-30}}</ref> Many contemporary men's journals (''e.g., The Days' Doings'') published sexualized images of the pair running their firm (although they did not participate in the day-to-day business of the firm), linking the concept of publicly minded, un-chaperoned women with ideas of \"[[Religion and sexuality|sexual immorality]]\" and [[prostitution]].<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 87\">Johnson, 1956, p. 87</ref>\n\n===Newspaper editor===\nOn the date of May 14, 1870, Woodhull and Claflin used the money they had made from their brokerage to found a newspaper, the ''Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly''.  Its primary purpose was to support Victoria Claflin Woodhull for President of the United States.  Published for the next six years, feminism was the ''Weekly'''s primary interest, but it became notorious for publishing controversial opinions on taboo topics, advocating among other things [[sex education]], [[free love]], women's suffrage, [[rational dress|short skirts]], [[spiritualism]], [[vegetarianism]], and licensed prostitution.  History often states the paper advocated [[birth control]], but some historians disagree.  The paper is now known for printing the first English version of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' in its December 30, 1871 edition, and the paper argued the cause of labor with eloquence and skill.  James Blood and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]] wrote the majority of the articles, as well as other able contributors.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 87\"/>\n\nIn 1872, the ''Weekly'' published a story that set off a national scandal and preoccupied the public for months.  [[Henry Ward Beecher]], a renowned preacher of Brooklyn's Plymouth Church, had condemned Woodhull's free love philosophy in his sermons.  But a member of his church, [[Theodore Tilton]], disclosed to [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], a colleague of Woodhull, that his wife had confessed Beecher was committing [[adultery]] with her.  Provoked by such hypocrisy, Woodhull decided to expose Beecher.  He ended up standing trial in 1875, for adultery in a proceeding that proved to be one of the most sensational legal episodes of the era, gripping the attention of hundreds of thousands of Americans: the trial ended with a [[hung jury]]; but the church won the case hands down.<ref name=\"Goldsmith, Other Powers\">Goldsmith, Other Powers</ref>\n\n[[George Francis Train]] once defended her. Other feminists of her time, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], disagreed with her tactics in pushing for women's equality. Some characterized her as opportunistic and unpredictable; in one notable incident, she had a run-in with Anthony during a meeting of the National Women's Suffrage Association (NWSA). (The radical NWSA later merged with the conservative American Women's Suffrage Association [AWSA] to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]].)\n\n===Women's rights advocate===\nWoodhull learned how to infiltrate the all-male domain of national politics and arranged to testify on women's suffrage before the [[House Judiciary Committee]].<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p.47\" /> Woodhull argued that women already had the right to vote&nbsp;\u2014 all they had to do was use it&nbsp;\u2014 since the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendments]] guaranteed the protection of that right for all citizens.<ref name=\"Woodhull\">[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?rbpebib:1:./temp/~ammem_enxC:: Constitutional equality. To the Hon. the Judiciary committee of the Senate and the House of representatives of the Congress of the United States ... Most respectfully submitted. Victoria C. Woodhull. Dated New York, January 2, 1871]</ref> The simple but powerful logic of her argument impressed some committee members.  Learning of Woodhull's planned address, suffrage leaders postponed the opening of the 1871 [[National Woman Suffrage Association]]'s third annual convention in Washington in order to attend the committee hearing. [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Isabella Beecher Hooker]], saw Woodhull as the newest champion of their cause.  They applauded her statement: \"[W]omen are the equals of men before the law, and are equal in all their rights.\"<ref name=\"Woodhull\"/>\n\nWith the power of her first public appearance as a woman's rights advocate, Woodhull moved to the leadership circle of the suffrage movement. Although her Constitutional argument was not original, she focused unprecedented public attention on suffrage. Woodhull was the first woman ever to petition Congress in person. Numerous newspapers reported her appearance before Congress. ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'' printed a full-page engraving of Woodhull, surrounded by prominent suffragists, delivering her argument.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p.47\" /><ref>Susan Kullmann, [http://feministgeek.com/teaching-learning/woodhull/ \"Legal Contender... Victoria C. Woodhull, First Woman to Run for President\"]. Accessed 2009.05.29.</ref>\n\n===First International===\nWoodhull joined the International Workingmen's Association, also known as the [[First International]].  She supported its goals by articles in her newspaper.  In the United States, many Yankee radicals, former [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and other progressive activists, became involved in the organization, which had been founded in England. German-American and ethnic Irish nearly lost control of the organization, and feared its goals were going to be lost in the broad-based, democratic egalitarianism promoted by the Americans. In 1871, the Germans expelled most of the English-speaking members of the First International's U.S. sections, leading to the quick decline of the organization, as it failed to attract the ethnic working class in America.<ref name=\"Messer-Kruse p470\">{{cite book|title=The Yankee International: Marxism and the American Reform Tradition, 1848\u20131876 |first=Timothy |last=Messer-Kruse |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KL3eYgNEchoC |pages=2\u20134}}</ref> Karl Marx commented disparagingly on Woodhull in 1872, and expressed approval of the expulsions.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Notes on the \"American split\" |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/09/splits.htm |quote= |publisher= |date= May 28, 1872 |accessdate=2010-08-05 }}</ref>\n\n===Presidential candidate===\n[[File:Victoria Woodhull caricature by Thomas Nast 1872.jpg|thumb|right|\"Get thee behind me, (Mrs.) Satan!\" 1872 caricature by [[Thomas Nast]]: Wife, carrying heavy burden of children and drunk husband, admonishing (Mrs.) Satan (Victoria Woodhull), \"I'd rather travel the hardest path of matrimony than follow your footsteps.\" Mrs. Satan's sign reads, \"Be saved by free love.\"]]\n\nWoodhull announced her candidacy for President by writing a letter to the editor of the ''[[New York Herald]] on April 2, 1870.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://interactive.ancestry.com/7689/NEWS-NY-NE_YO_HE.1870_01_22_0007/456185863?backurl=http%253a%252f%252fsearch.ancestry.com%252fcgi-bin%252fsse.dll%253fdb%253dNEWS-NY-NE_YO_HE%2526gss%253dsfs28_ms_db%2526new%253d1%2526rank%253d1%2526msT%253d1%2526gskw%253d%252522The%252bQueens%252bof%252bFinance%252522%2526MSAV%253d1%2526uidh%253dzm2&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnSearchResults&rc=1592,146,1670,213;1696,146,1853,213;1879,146,1931,213;1957,146,2166,213#?imageId=NEWS-NY-NE_YO_HE.1870_04_02_0005|title=Please wait...|website=interactive.ancestry.com|access-date=2016-04-30}}</ref>\n\nWoodhull was nominated for [[President of the United States]] by the newly formed [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] on May 10, 1872, at Apollo Hall, New York City. A year earlier, she had announced her intention to run. Also in 1871, she spoke publicly against the government being composed only of men; she proposed developing a new constitution and a new government a year thence.<ref>''A Lecture on Constitutional Equality'', also known as ''The Great Secession Speech'', speech to Woman's Suffrage Convention, New York, May 11, 1871, excerpt quoted in Gabriel, Mary, ''Notorious Victoria: The Life of Victoria Woodhull, Uncensored'' (Chapel Hill, N.Car.: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1st ed. 1998 (ISBN 1-56512-132-5)), pp. 86\u201387 & n. [13] (author Mary Gabriel journalist, Reuters News Service). Also excerpted, differently, in Underhill, Lois Beachy, ''The Woman Who Ran for President: The Many Lives of Victoria Woodhull'' (Bridgehampton, N.Y.: Bridge Works, 1st ed. 1995 (ISBN 1-882593-10-3)), pp. 125\u2013126 & unnumbered n.</ref> Her nomination was ratified at the convention on June 6, 1872. They nominated the former slave and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] leader [[Frederick Douglass]] for Vice President. He did not attend the convention and never acknowledged the nomination.  He served as a [[presidential elector]] in the [[United States Electoral College]] for the State of New York. This made her the first woman candidate.\n\nWhile many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for President of the United States, some have questioned that priority given issues with the legality of her run. They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35.  However, election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue.  The presidential inauguration was in March 1873. Woodhull's 35th birthday was in September 1873.\n\nWoodhull's campaign was also notable for the nomination of [[Frederick Douglass]], although he did not take part in it. His nomination stirred up controversy about the mixing of [[whites]] and [[Black people|blacks]] in public life and fears of [[miscegenation]] (especially as he had married a much younger white woman after his first wife died). The Equal Rights Party hoped to use the nominations to reunite suffragists with African-American [[civil rights]] activists, as the exclusion of female suffrage from the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] two years earlier had caused a substantial rift between the groups.\n\nHaving been vilified in the media for her support of [[free love]], Woodhull devoted an issue of ''Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly'' (November 2, 1872) to an alleged adulterous affair between Elizabeth Tilton and Reverend [[Henry Ward Beecher]], a prominent Protestant minister in New York (he supported female suffrage but had lectured against free love in his sermons).  Woodhull published the article to highlight what she saw as a sexual double-standard between men and women.\n\nThat same day, a few days before the presidential election, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Federal Marshals]] arrested Woodhull, her second husband [[Colonel James Blood]], and her sister [[Tennie C. Claflin]] on charges of \"publishing an obscene newspaper\" because of the content of this issue.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Arrest of Victoria Woodhull, Tennie C.

The arrest was arranged by [[Anthony Comstock]], the self-appointed moral defender of the nation at the time.  Opponents raised questions about censorship and government persecution. The three were acquitted on a technicality six months later, but the arrest prevented Woodhull from attempting to vote during the 1872 presidential election. With the publication of the scandal, [[Theodore Tilton]], the husband of Elizabeth, sued Beecher for \"alienation of affection.\" The trial in 1875 was sensationalized across the nation, and eventually resulted in a hung jury.<ref name=\"Goldsmith, Other Powers\"/>\n\nWoodhull again tried to gain nominations for the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1884|1884]] and [[United States presidential election, 1892|1892]]. Newspapers reported that her 1892 attempt culminated in her nomination by the \"National Woman Suffragists' Nominating Convention\" on 21 September.  [[Marietta Stow|Mary L. Stowe]] of California was nominated as the candidate for vice president.  The convention was held at Willard's Hotel in [[Boonville (town), New York|Boonville, New York]], and [[Anna M. Parker]] was its president.  Some woman's suffrage organizations repudiated the nominations, however, claiming that the nominating committee was unauthorized.  Woodhull was quoted as saying that she was \"destined\" by \"prophecy\" to be elected president of the United States in the upcoming election.\n\n==Life in England and third marriage==\n{{unreferenced section|date = May 2013}}\n\nIn October 1876, Woodhull divorced her second husband, Colonel Blood.  Less than a year later, exhausted and possibly depressed, she left to start a new life.  When Commodore Vanderbilt died, his son [[William Henry Vanderbilt]] gave Victoria and Tennessee a large sum of money to leave the country and set up in England.\n\nShe made her first public appearance as a lecturer at [[St. James's Hall]] in London on December 4, 1877.  Her lecture was called ''The Human Body, the Temple of God'', a lecture which she had previously presented in the United States.  Present at one of her lectures was the banker [[John Biddulph Martin]].  They began to see each other and married on October 31, 1883.  His family disapproved of the union, but eventually gave in.\n\nFrom then on, she was known as Victoria Woodhull Martin.  Under that name, she published the magazine, ''The Humanitarian,'' from 1892 to 1901, with help from her daughter Zula Woodhull. After her husband died in 1901, Martin gave up publishing and retired to the country, establishing residence at [[Bredon|Bredon's Norton]].\n\n== Views on abortion and eugenics ==\n\nHer opposition to [[abortion]] is frequently cited by opponents of abortion when writing about [[first wave feminism]]. The most common Woodhull quotations cited by opponents of abortion are:\n\n:\u201cthe rights of children as individuals begin while yet they remain the foetus\u201d<ref>Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly (1870)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://quotes.yourdictionary.com/author/quote/562703 |title=The rights of children as individuals begin while yet they remain... - Quote |publisher=Quotes.yourdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}</ref>\n\n:\u201cEvery woman knows that if she were free, she would never bear an unwished-for child, nor think of murdering one before its birth.<ref>Wheeling, West Virginia Evening Standard (1875)</ref>\n\nWoodhull also promoted [[eugenics]] which was popular in the early 20th century prior to World War II.  Her interest in eugenics might have been motivated by the profound intellectual impairment of her son.  She advocated, among other things, sex education, \"marrying well,\" and pre-natal care as a way to bear healthier children and to prevent mental and physical disease.  Her writings demonstrate views closer to those of the anarchist eugenists, rather than the coercive eugenists like [[Francis Galton|Sir Francis Galton]].  In 2006, publisher Michael W. Perry claimed in his book \"Lady Eugenist\" that Woodhull supported the forcible sterilization of those she considered unfit to breed.  He based his claim on a ''New York Times'' article from 1927 in which she concurred with the ruling of the case [[Buck v. Bell]].  Whether the article accurately stated her views or not, it stands in stark contrast to her earlier works in which she advocated social freedom and opposed government interference in matters of love and marriage.  Woodhull-Martin, died on June 10, 1927, at [[Norton Park]] in Bredon's Norton, Worcestershire.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last=  |title=Victoria Martin, Suffragist, Dies.

In 1987, she went to the [[United States]] to pursue her studies. In 1992, she earned an [[MBA]] from [[New York University]], where she gave commencement speech on behalf of her classmates. Yu went to work on Wall Street, which she compared to a pressure cooker. Yu lived in the United States for ten years, during which time she accumulated the capital and experience necessary to become an entrepreneur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/wealthperson/2004-06-21/981.html |title=\u4fde\u6e1d_\u8d22\u7ecf\u4eba\u7269_\u8d22\u7ecf\u7eb5\u6a2a_\u65b0\u6d6a\u7f51 |publisher=Finance.sina.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref> In 1996, Peggy met [[Li Guoqing]] (GQ), an easygoing, open and creative book publisher in China. They fell in love and got married after dating for only 3 months. In 1999, the couple created [[www.dangdang.com|Dangdang]] (\u5f53\u5f53\u7f51), which is currently the largest online bookstore in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finance.ifeng.com/company/data/detail/2958.shtml |title=\u5f53\u5f53\u7f51\u8be6\u7ec6\u8d44\u6599_\u4f01\u4e1a\u5355\u4f4d_\u8d22\u7ecf_\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51 |publisher=Finance.ifeng.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nYu is the chairwoman of [[Dangdang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finance.ifeng.com/people/detail/comchief/yuyu.shtml |title=\u4fde\u6e1d_\u8d22\u7ecf\u4eba\u7269_\u8d22\u7ecf_\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51 |publisher=Finance.ifeng.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref> The idea for the company came during her stay in the United States, during which time her favorite hobby after work was going to nearby bookstores. Yu had also paid careful attention to the establishment and development of [[Amazon.com]] since early 1995 when she was working on [[Wall Street]]. When she met her husband, she had the idea to start a similar online company in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.tech.163.com/renwu/data/63.html |title=\u674e\u56fd\u5e86_\u4eba\u7269\u8d44\u6599\u5e93_\u7f51\u6613\u79d1\u6280 |publisher=Go.tech.163.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref> As the executive, Yu considers business issues from both an investor's and manager's perspective. Since the company's creation in 1999, [[Dangdang]] has expanded to become an online bookstore with over 6,000,000 books, as well as home goods, clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, DVDs, and movies.\n\nOn July 9, 2015, almost five years after she took Dangdang public on NYSE, Peggy Yu proposed to buyout the company from shareholders at a valuation of $630 million. Peggy Yu's proposed valuation was less than half of Dangdang's IPO valuation. The proposed buyout price, $7.81 per ADS, by Peggy Yu and her husband Guoqing Li, was the lowest among all Chinese ADRs seeking to go private, even 20% lower than the company's prior 30 days average trading price, according to Bloomberg. \n\nDangdang shareholders widely protested the proposed offer and launched a dedicated shareholders activism website, [http://dangdangfacts.com dangdangfacts.com] with assertions that Peggy Yu unfairly took advantages of minority shareholders.<ref name=\"Dangdang Mangement's Opportunistic Proposal\">{{cite news|last1=Michael|first1=Santoli|title=Shanghai stock rout invites timely buyout bids for U.S.-listed Chinese firms|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/shanghai-stock-rout-invites-timely-buyout-bids-for-u-s--listed-chinese-firms-195506123.html|accessdate=17 July 2015|publisher=Yahoo Finance|date=17 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn addition to being a successful businesswoman, Yu is also a wife and mother. She prides herself on balancing her family life, personal life and professional life and keeping them clearly separated. She and her husband have an agreement that they do not discuss anything concerning business when they are at home or after 10pm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjkwNDE1OTc2.html.com/ |title=\u300a\u5357\u5e0c\u8d22\u667a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u300b\u4fde\u6e1d\uff0820110205\uff09 - \u89c6\u9891 - \u4f18\u9177\u89c6\u9891 - \u5728\u7ebf\u89c2\u770b |publisher=V.youku.com |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref> Yu's personal model is her grandmother.
