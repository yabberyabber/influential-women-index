She therefore enrolled at [[Christ the King Regional High School]] in [[Queens]], New York. Sue spent two seasons at Christ the King, and the Royals went 24\u20133 her Junior year. In the second season her team finished undefeated and won the New York state championship, and the national title.

She considered UConn the favorite, but she began to waver when Keirsten Walters and Brianne Stepherson, both point guards, announced commitments to UConn. She worried that there might not be room for her to play. However, Stepherson changed her mind, and decided to go to [[Boston College Eagles women's basketball|Boston College]], making the decision a bit easier, so Bird committed to UConn.<ref>Goldberg p 10\u201311</ref> In addition, she chose UConn because it was close to home, and the UConn program had a winning tradition like the one at Christ the King.<ref name=\"uconnhooplegends.com\"/> She suffered a [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn ACL]] eight games into her freshman season. She was not able to [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]], because she had played in more than 20% of the team's games.<ref name=\"jockbio.com\"/> In her sophomore season (1999\u20132000) she came back to lead the team to a 36\u20131 record and won the Big East Championship and the [[2000 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament]].  The Huskies went 32\u20133 in her junior season. The last loss was to Big East rival [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball|Notre Dame]] in the Final Four. That was the last loss of Bird's college career, as the Huskies went an undefeated 39\u20130 in her 2002 senior season. In that season, she won the [[Wade Trophy]] and [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith Award]] as College Player of the Year.<ref name=\"Wade Trophy\"/>\n\nDuring her junior year, Bird played in a game against Notre Dame referred to as \"the best women's basketball game ever played\".

Born in [[Lucedale, Mississippi]], she played at the collegiate, Olympic and professional levels of women's basketball. Bolton played in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA) from 1997 through 2004 with the [[Sacramento Monarchs]]. She played [[college basketball|collegiately]] at [[Auburn University]], teaming with her older sister, Mae Ola Bolton. Bolton has also served as a [[first lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Reserve]]s as a transportation officer.\n\n==USA Basketball==\n\nBolton was named to the team representing the USA at the [[World University Games]] held during July 1991 in [[Sheffield, England]].  While the USA team had won gold in 1983, they finished with the silver in 1985, in fifth place in 1987, and did not field a team in 1989. The team was coached by [[Tara VanDerveer]] of Stanford. After winning opening games easily, the USA faced China in the medal round. The USA shot only 36% from the field, but limited the team from China to 35%, and won 79\u201376 to advance to the gold medal game. There they faced 7\u20130 Spain, but won 88\u201362 to claim the gold medal. Bolton was the team's leading scorer with 14 points per game, just ahead of [[Lisa Leslie]]'s 13 points per game.<ref name=\"1991 WUG\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Bolton-Holifield was named to the national team which competed in the World Championships in [[Sydney, Australia]]. The team was coached by [[Tara VanDerveer]]. The team won their early games, then advanced to the medal rounds and faced Brazil. Despite  17 points from Bolton-Holifield and 29 from [[Katrina McClain]], the USA fell 110\u2013107 when Brazil hit ten of ten free throws in the final minute. The USA went on to defeat Australia 100\u201395 to claim the bronze medal.<ref name=\"1994 WC\"/>\n\nBolton continued with the national team to the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Bolton was the leading scorer in the game against the Ukraine, with 21 points. She helped the team win all eight games to win the gold medal for the USA team. Bolton averaged 12.8 points per game and led the team in steals with 23.<ref name=\"1996 Olympics\"/>\n\nThe national team traveled to [[Berlin, Germany]] in July and August 1998 for the FIBA World Championships. The USA team won a close opening game against Japan 95\u201389, then won their next six games easily. In the semifinal game against Brazil, the USA team was behind as much as ten points in the first half. Bolton hit a three pointer in the second half to give her team the lead, as part of a 16-point scoring effort, and the USA went on to win 93\u201379. The gold medal game was a rematch against Russia. In the first game, the USA team dominated almost from the beginning, but in the rematch, the team from Russia took the early lead and led much of the way. With under two minutes remaining, the USA was down by two points when Bolton  hit a three pointer to give the USA a lead. Russia tied the game, but Bolton hit another three to give the USA a lead they would not give up. The USA held on to win the gold medal 71\u201365.<ref name=\"1998 WC\"/>\n\nBolton continued with the national team to the [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] in [[Sydney, Australia]]. The USA won all eight games, including the gold medal game against host Australia to win the gold medal. Bolton averaged 5.0 points per game.<ref name=\"2000 Olympics\"/>\n\n== Current activities ==\nAfter being released by the Monarchs as an active player in 2005, she returned to the Monarchs to work in their front office, specializing in [[public relations]]. In 2004 and 2005, she served as the head coach for the women's basketball team at [[William Jessup University]], a [[California Pacific Conference]] school in [[Rocklin, California]]. Currently Bolton is the head coach for women's basketball at Vacaville Christian High School in [[Vacaville, California]]; she also dabbles in [[gospel music|gospel singing]].\n\nMs. Bolton has also been an active participant in the [[SportsUnited]] Sports Envoy program for the [[Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]. In this function, she has traveled to [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Moldova]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] to conduct basketball clinics for approximately 1300 youth and women worldwide. In so doing, Bolton helped contribute to SportsUnited's mission to promote greater understanding and inclusion through sport and supported the U.S. foreign policy goal of advancing the status of women and girls around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://globalsportswomen.org/blog/sports-envoys-and-gsmp-alumna-karo-lelai-team-up-in-papua-new-guinea|title=Sports Envoys and GSMP alumna Karo Lelai team up in Papua New Guinea \u2013 Empowering Women and Girls Initiative|website=Empowering Women and Girls Initiative|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kazakhstan.usembassy.gov/pr-06-07-13.html|title=U.S. Mission Brings WNBA Athletes for Sports Envoy Program in Kazakhstan {{!}} Astana, Kazakhstan - United States Diplomatic Mission|website=kazakhstan.usembassy.gov|access-date=2016-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/313915|title=WNBA, Jeddah United collaborate|date=2008-07-19|website=Arab News|access-date=2016-05-01}}</ref>\n\nShe currently lives in [[Elk Grove, California]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"1991 WUG\">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Fifteenth World University Games -- 1993|url=http://www.usab.com/history/world-university-games-womens/fifteenth-world-university-games-1991.aspx|work=|publisher=USA Basketball|accessdate=12 October 2015| archive-url     = https://web.archive.org/web/20150907023628/http://www.usab.com/history/world-university-games-womens/fifteenth-world-university-games-1991.aspx | archive-date    =7 September 2015|dead-url=no}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1994 WC\">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title={{sic|Twelv|th|nolink=yes}} World Championship For Women -- 1994|url=http://www.usab.com/womens/national/wwc_1994.html|work=|publisher=USA Basketball|accessdate=13 Oct 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1996 Olympics\">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Games of the XXVIth Olympiad -- 1996|url=http://www.usab.com/womens/national/woly_1996.html|work=|publisher=USA Basketball|accessdate=13 Oct 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"1998 WC\">{{cite web|title=Thirteenth World Championship For Women -- 1998|date=June 10, 2010|url=http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-womens/thirteenth-world-championship-for-women-1998.aspx|publisher=USA Basketball|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905203810/http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-womens/thirteenth-world-championship-for-women-1998.aspx|archive-date=5 September 2015|dead-url=no|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"2000 Olympics\">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Games of the XXVIIth Olympiad -- 2000|url=http://www.usab.com/womens/national/woly_2000.html|work=|publisher=USA Basketball|accessdate=13 Oct 2013}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/ruthie_bolton-holifield/ WNBA player profile]\n*[http://www.jessup.edu/athletics/coachbolton Coaching profile at William Jessup University]\n*[http://www.sacbee.com/content/sports/basketball/monarchs/story/14040391p-14872001c.html January 7, 2006 ''Sacramento Bee'' article]\n{{United States Women Basketball Squad 1996 Summer Olympics}}\n{{United States Women Basketball Squad 2000 Summer Olympics}}\n{{USA Basketball Female Athlete of the Year}}\n{{WNBADec}}\n{{Women's Basketball Hall of Fame}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bolton, Ruthie}}\n[[Category:1967 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American expatriate basketball people in Hungary]]\n[[Category:American expatriate basketball people in Italy]]\n[[Category:American expatriate basketball people in Sweden]]\n[[Category:American expatriate basketball people in Turkey]]\n[[Category:American women's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Auburn Tigers women's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Basketball players at the 2000 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Basketball players from Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Galatasaray S.K.

She and her twin sister later enrolled at [[Westview High School (Beaverton)|Westview High School]], in the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] suburb of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]].\n\nBraxton attended the [[University of Georgia]], and was freshman of the year. She was frequently late to practice and committed other unspecified violations of team rules, and after three suspensions during the 2002\u201303 season, on February 20, 2004, coach Andy Landers dismissed Braxton from the team.<ref>Associated Press, [http://www.secsports.com/news/default.aspx?ArticleId=3489 \"Georgia Dismisses Leading Scorer Braxton\"] February 20, 2004</ref> She graduated in 2005.\n\n==Georgia statistics==\nSource<ref name=\"NCAA Player stats\"/>\n{{NBA player statistics legend}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n  !Year\n  !Team\n  !GP\n  !Points\n  !FG%\n  !3P%\n  !FT%\n  !RPG\n  !APG\n  !SPG\n  !BPG\n  !PPG\n \n |-\n  |2001-02\n  |[[Georgia Lady Bulldogs basketball|Georgia]]\n  |30\n  |489\n  |54.0\n  |14.3\n  |62.6\n  |6.8\n  |2.3\n  |1.8\n  |2.0\n  |16.3\n \n |-\n  |2002-03\n  |Georgia\n  |21\n  |330\n  |55.1\n  |28.6\n  |73.2\n  |7.3\n  |2.5\n  |1.4\n  |2.0\n  |15.7\n \n |-\n  |2003-04\n  |Georgia\n  |20\n  |274\n  |47.8\n  |16.7\n  |64.8\n  |8.0\n  |1.2\n  |1.4\n  |1.3\n  |13.7\n \n |-\n  |Career\n  |Georgia\n  |71\n  |1582\n  |52.6\n  |20.0\n  |65.9\n  |7.3\n  |2.0\n  |1.6\n  |1.8\n  |15.4\n |}\n\n==The WNBA==\nOn April 16, 2005, the Shock drafted Braxton in the first round and was the seventh overall pick in the annual [[WNBA draft]]. She had given birth to a son, Jelani, in January 2005. Jelani's father is [[Cincinnati Bengals]] linebacker [[Odell Thurman]].\n\nBraxton was named to the WNBA's All-Rookie team in 2005 after averaging 6.9 points and 3.0 rebounds as a key reserve for the Shock. In 2006 she averaged fewer minutes and points than in her rookie season, but helped the Shock win the WNBA title that year.\n\nIn 2007, Braxton became Detroit's starting center after the Shock traded [[Ruth Riley]] to the [[San Antonio Stars]].

She \"tried her hands at\" baseball, track, and cheerleading, but her true passion was entertainment, which she expressed in school plays and drama class.<ref name=DList/> Cash is best known for her basketball skills, which earned her a place on the national  [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]] All-American. She participated in the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association#WBCA High School All-America Game|WBCA High School All-America Game]] where she scored fourteen points, and earned MVP honors.<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\"/><ref name=\"WBCA MVP\"/>\n\n==College==\nCash was an [[All-American]] at the [[University of Connecticut]] (UConn).

Swin appeared (as herself) in the movie [[Bring It On: All or Nothing]].<ref name=\"imdb\" />\n\nCash received the Dapper Dan Sportswoman of the Year award in April 2007.<ref name=\"DD Award\" />  This is an award given to someone who shows excellence to the [[Pittsburgh]] area.  She was also honored with [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Dan Rooney]].\n\nCash left Detroit for the 2008 season after \"struggling to build a consistent relationship with Detroit Shock head coach [[Bill Laimbeer]]\". On February 19, 2008 Cash was traded to the [[Seattle Storm]] for the draft rights of No. 4 pick in the 2008 WNBA draft.<ref name=\"wnba trans\" /> The Shock selected [[Alexis Hornbuckle]] with their draft pick.<ref name=\"WNBA Draft\" /> Cash helped the Storm win their second championship in 2010.<ref name=\"WNBA Title\"/>  On January 2, 2012, in perhaps the WNBA's biggest blockbuster trade news thus far, Cash was traded, along with [[Le'Coe Willingham]], to the [[Chicago Sky]] joining All- Star [[Sylvia Fowles]].\n\nCash has been suffering from a herniated disk for more than two years,<ref name=\"Slam\" /> an injury suffered while helping the Detroit Shock win the WNBA championship in 2006.

The team was coached by [[Geno Auriemma]]. Because many team members were still playing in the [[WNBA]] until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for [[Ostrava]] and [[Karlovy Vary]], Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win its first games against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring  honors, with Cash, [[Angel McCoughtry]], [[Maya Moore]], [[Diana Taurasi]], [[Lindsay Whalen]], and [[Sylvia Fowles]] all ending as high scorer in the first few games.

Catchings played for the [[USA Basketball|USA women's basketball team]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]], helping the team win the gold medal.\n\nIn 2005, she scored her 2,000th point in the WNBA. With this she became the fastest player to score 2000 career points in the WNBA, reaching the milestone in only four seasons of play. She is also the fastest to 1,000 rebounds, 400 assists, and 300 steals. In 2005, Catchings was also named the [[WNBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|WNBA Defensive Player of the Year]]. Catchings then repeated as Defensive Player of the Year in 2006. She was again named Defensive Player of the Year in 2009 and 2010. Also during the 2009 season she led her [[Indiana Fever]] to their first ever Eastern Conference championship, however they fell short in their quest to win the WNBA title as they were defeated in five games by the [[Phoenix Mercury]].\n\nIn 2006, she was voted into the [[2006 WNBA All-Star Game]], and was also the leading vote-getter, but had to sit out because of a foot injury. At half-time she was announced as a member of the [[WNBA's All-Decade Team|All-Decade Team]] along with 9 other players and former [[Houston Comets|Comets]] coach [[Van Chancellor]]. Five years later she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA.<ref>http://www.wnba.com/allstar/2011/top15_072311.html</ref>\n\nCatchings was selected to be a member of the National team representing the USA at the World Championships held in September and October 2010. The team was coached by [[Geno Auriemma]]. Because many team members were still playing in the [[WNBA]] until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for [[Ostrava]] and [[Karlovy Vary]], Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win its first games against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring  honors, with [[Swin Cash]], [[Angel McCoughtry]], [[Maya Moore]], [[Diana Taurasi]], [[Lindsay Whalen]], and [[Sylvia Fowles]] all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia \u2014 the USA jumped out to a 24-point lead and the USA prevailed 83\u201375. The USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The USA team had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA went on to win the championship and gold medal. Catchings averaged 8.8 points per game.<ref name=\"2010 WC\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Catchings led the league in steals with 2.9 SPG and helped lead the Indiana Fever to a 22-12 record, earning the top seed in the eastern conference. They would end up making it to the finals that year to face the Phoenix Mercury and had a 2-1 series lead but would lose the next two games to be defeated in the finals 3-2.\n\nIn 2011, Catchings won WNBA Most Valuable Player while averaging 15.5 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 3.5 APG and 2.0 SPG also leading the Indiana Fever to a 21-13 record, topping the eastern conference standings. However, in the playoffs she performed poorly offensively averaging a playoff career low 10.0 PPG. The Indiana Fever would end up making it to the eastern conference finals where they got eliminated 2-1 to the [[Atlanta Dream]].\n\nIn 2012, the Indiana Fever finished second in the eastern conference with a 22-12 record. They made it back to finals that year, this time against the championship defending [[Minnesota Lynx]], but they would defeat Minnesota 3-1 in the series becoming only the second eastern conference franchise to win a WNBA title. Catchings also won [[WNBA Finals MVP Award|WNBA Finals MVP]].\n\nOn August 23, 2014 she set the all time WNBA playoff scoring record off a three-point field goal in Game 3 of the eastern conference semifinals against the [[Washington Mystics]] surpassing [[Lisa Leslie]]'s 908 career playoff points. She finished the game with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 7 steals also surpassing Lisa Leslie for most WNBA career playoff rebounds (471).<ref>http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/basketball/wnba/fever/2014/08/23/tamika-catchings-scores-fever-advance-past-mystics/14510175/</ref>\n\nAfter the 2014 season she ranks 1st all-time in career playoff points, 1st all-time in career playoff rebounds and 3rd in all-time career regular season scoring. She also holds the WNBA record for most consecutive playoff appearances of 10 straight seasons.\n\nIn October 2014 in a TV interview, she revealed that she will be retiring after the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. She said:<blockquote>\"I will be retiring in 2016, Lord willing, if my body holds up. Although I plan to step away as a player that is not to say I'll step away from the game, hopefully. I am so thankful and blessed to have had an opportunity to play the game I have loved for so long. God has truly blessed me with an amazing playing career, and now it's time to start transitioning to what He has for me beyond the lines of the basketball floor.\"<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2014/10/03/catchings-says-she-will-retire-after-2016-olympics/16641693/ WNBA star Tamika Catchings to retire after 2016

She led her team to the California State Championship (4A) scoring an average of 31 points per game, and scoring 44 points in one game. Cooper was named the Los Angeles Player of the Year.<ref name=\"porter\" />\n\n===College===\nCooper was a four-year letter winner at guard for USC from 1982\u20131986. She led the Women of Troy to NCAA appearances in all four years, Final Four appearances in three of her four years, and back-to-back NCAA tournament titles in [[1983 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983]] and [[1984 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|1984]].<ref name=\"porter\" /> After the 1984 Championship, she briefly left school, but was persuaded to return.

Cooper ranks eighth on USC\u2019s all-time scoring list with 1,559 points, fifth in assists (381) and third in steals (256). While Cooper was at USC, the Women of Troy compiled a record of 114\u201315.<ref name=\"porter\" />\n\n==Career==\n\n===Team USA===\nCooper was named to represent the USA at the 1981 [[William Jones Cup]] competition in [[Taipei, Taiwan]], while still in high school. The team won seven of eight games to win the silver medal for the event. Cooper scored 2.8 points per game and recorded nine steals.<ref name=\"1981 Jones Cup\" />\n\nCooper was selected to represent the USA at the inaugural Goodwill games, held in [[Moscow]] in July 1986. [[North Carolina State]]'s [[Kay Yow]] served as head coach. The team opened up with a 72\u201353 of Yugoslavia, and followed that with a 21-point win over Brazil 91\u201370. The third game was against Czechoslovakia and would be much closer. [[Cheryl Miller]] was the scoring leader in this game, scoring 26 points to help the USA to a 78\u201370 victory. The USA faced Bulgaria in the semi-final match up, and again won, this time 67\u201358. This set up the final against the Soviet Union, led by 7-foot-2 Ivilana Semenova, considered the most dominant player in the world. The Soviet team, had a 152\u20132 record in major international competition over the prior three decades, including an 84\u201382 win over the USA in the 1983 World Championships. The Soviets held the early edge, leading 21\u201319 at one time, before the USA went on a scoring run to take a large lead they would never relinquish. The final score was 83\u201360 in favor of the USA, earning the gold medal for the USA squad. Cooper  averaged 2.0 points per game.<ref name=\"1986 Goodwill\" />\n\nCooper continued to represent the USA with National team at the 1986 World Championship, held in Moscow, a month after the Goodwill games in Moscow. The USA team was even more dominant this time. The early games were won easily, and the semifinal against Canada, while the closest game for the USA so far, ended up an 82\u201359 victory.  At the same time, the Soviet team was winning easily as well, and the final game pitted two teams each with 6\u20130 records. The Soviet team, having lost only once at home, wanted to show that the Goodwill games setback was a fluke. The USA team started by scoring the first eight points, and raced to a 45\u201323 lead, although the Soviets fought back and reduced the halftime margin to 13. The USA went on a 15\u20141 run in the second half to out the game away, and ended up winning the gold medal with a score of 108\u201388.

(born October 19, 1966), also known as \u201cGoodie\u201d or \u201cGoody\u201d, is a former basketball player, a 6-foot forward noted for her exceptional rebounding ability, especially on the offensive glass. Her professional career in Brazil, the [[American Basketball League (1996-1998)|ABL]], and the [[WNBA]] spanned 14 years.\n\n== Amateur basketball career ==\nBorn in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], Goodson became interested in basketball at the age of seven. She played for [[Bayonne High School]],<ref>Goodson, Adrienne. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/wnba/news/2000/05/18/goodson_two/ \"The rest is history\"], ''[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]'', May 18, 2000. Accessed April 24, 2008. \"My name is Adrienne Goodson, and I was born and raised in Bayonne, New Jersey where I graduated from Bayonne High School.\"</ref> where she was a consensus high school All-American, named as such by ''[[Parade Magazine]]'', [[Adidas]], Coach, [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], the [[Amateur Athletic Union]], and ''[[USA Today]]''.\n\nShe went on to attend [[Old Dominion University]], where she graduated in 1988 with a degree in secondary education. In her freshman season there, Goodson averaged 9.5 points per game, and the team won first the [[Sun Belt Conference]] title, and then the [[1985 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. In the NCAA title game, Goodson scored nine points and hauled in six rebounds to help the Lady Monarchs defeat Georgia 70-65, as Old Dominion rolled to a 31-3 record.\n\nDuring her college career, Goodson was a two-time second team All-Star performer. In 1987, she was named the Sun Belt Conference tournament's Most Valuable Player, as the Lady Monarchs won the Sun Belt Conference title again. As a Senior in 1988, she was named the Sun Belt Player of the Year.\n\nIn all, Goodson helped lead Old Dominion to three NCAA tournaments. She finished her college career with 1,574 points and 863 rebounds. She ranks 11th all-time in scoring at Old Dominion. She was inducted into the Old Dominion University Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nFollowing her graduation in 1988, Goodson captained the 1993 USA National Basketball Team.\n\n==USA Basketball==\nGoodson was named to the team representing the USA at the 1993 [[USA Women's World University Games Team|World University Games]] competition in [[Buffalo, New York]]. The team had a 6\u20132 record, wnning the bronze medal. Goodson was the captain of the USA team, and led the team in scoring with 20 points, in the game against Russia.  Goodson was the second leading scorer on the USA team, averaging 13.1 points per game over the eight games. She also led the team ins teals with 15.<ref name=\"1993 WUG\"/>\n\n==Professional basketball career==\n\n===In Brazil===\nNo American professional women's league existed when Goodson graduated in 1988, so she played professionally in Brazil for five years. Goodson won five championships in the run-and-gun Brazilian league, learned to speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and left many friends behind at the end of her career there, but the lure of playing back home was too good to pass up, even with the pay cut she took.\n\n===In the American Basketball League (1996\u20131998)===\nIn 1996, Goodson left a successful career in Brazil in 1996 to play in the inaugural season of the now-defunct [[American Basketball League (1996\u20131998)]]. In the 2\u00bd years that the ABL existed, she played for the [[Philadelphia Rage|Richmond/Philadelphia Rage]], and later for the [[Chicago Condors]].\n\nIn her first season back on American soil, Goodson continued her winning ways, helping lead the Richmond Rage to the ABL finals, where they lost to the [[Columbus Quest]]. She finished her first US pro season with averages of 17.7 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. In her second year with the Rage, which by then had moved to Philadelphia, she posted averages of 17.4 points and 8.7 rebounds, both tops on the team. The 6-foot forward earned the league's Player of the Week honors several times.\n\nShe was an ABL All-Star both years, and is one of only five players twice named to the All-ABL Team (the others in that select group are [[Teresa Edwards]], [[Carolyn Jones-Young]], [[Dawn Staley]], and [[Natalie Williams]]). She ranks fourth with 1,658 career ABL points scored,<ref>[http://www.wnba.com/shock/history/abl_career_points.html SHOCK: ABL Career Records: Points<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is second only to Williams in ABL career offensive rebounds, with 293. She averaged 17.5 points and 7.9 rebounds per game in the ABL.\n\n===In the WNBA (1999\u20132005)===\nGoodson was selected in the third round (27th overall) in the 1999 [[WNBA]] consolidation draft. In her seven-year WNBA career, Goodson played with the [[Utah Starzz]] (1999\u20132002), [[San Antonio Silver Stars]] (2002\u201304), and [[Houston Comets]] (2005), finishing her career with the [[Charlotte Sting]].  She averaged 12.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists in her WNBA career. In 1999, she started in all but one game with Utah and averaged 14.9 points. In 2002, she was selected to the WNBA All-Star Team.  She is only the third Woman in the history of the WNBA to score over 4000 points with over 1500 rebounds.\n\nShe has been named the best six foot and under rebounder in the world by several basketball experts.  Adrienne received the 2003 WNBA Off-Season Community Assist Award, and she continues to give back to her community.  Goodson believes the strongest assets she brings to a team are her leadership ability, work ethic and dedication.\n[http://www.wnba.com/media/silverstars/goody_commassist_04.jpg]\n<nowiki>Adrienne Goodson picks up her second consecutive WNBA Offseason Community Assist Award.\nSource:Silver Stars Photo\n</nowiki>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"1993 WUG\">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Sixteenth World University Games -- 1993|url=http://www.usab.com/history/world-university-games-womens/sixteenth-world-university-games-1993.aspx|work=|publisher=USA Basketball|accessdate=12 October 2015| archive-url     = https://web.archive.org/web/20150907193836/http://www.usab.com/history/world-university-games-womens/sixteenth-world-university-games-1993.aspx | archive-date    =7 September 2015|dead-url=no}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{1999 WNBA Draft}}\n{{San Antonio Silver Stars}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goodson, Adrienne}}\n[[Category:1966 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American expatriate basketball people in Brazil]]\n[[Category:American women's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Basketball players from New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Charlotte Sting players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Condors players]]\n[[Category:Houston Comets players]]\n[[Category:Old Dominion Lady Monarchs basketball players]]\n[[Category:People from Bayonne, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Philadelphia Rage players]]\n[[Category:San Antonio Stars players]]\n[[Category:Small forwards]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Hudson County, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Utah Starzz players]]\n[[Category:Women's National Basketball Association All-Stars]]"}]},"1207048":{"pageid":1207048,"ns":0,"title":"Yolanda Griffith","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox basketball biography\n| name = Yolanda Griffith\n| image = Griffith Yolanda Headshot.jpg\n| team = \n| position = [[Center (basketball)|Center]]\n| height_ft = 6 | height_in = 3\n| weight_lbs = 188\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1970|03|1}}\n| birth_place = [[Chicago, Illinois]]\n| nationality =  American\n| high_school = [[Carver Military Academy|Carver]] (Chicago, Illinois)\n| college = \n*[[Palm Beach Community College|Palm Beach CC]] (1990\u20131992)\n*[[Florida Atlantic Owls women's basketball|Florida Atlantic]] (1992\u20131993)\n| draft_league = WNBA\n| draft_year = 1999\n| draft_round = 1\n| draft_pick = 2\n| draft_team = [[Sacramento Monarchs]]\n| career_start = 1993\n| career_end = 2009\n| career_number = 33, 13\n| years1 = 1997\u20131998\n| team1 = [[Long Beach Stingrays]]\n| years2 = 1998\n| team2 = [[Chicago Condors]]\n| years3 = 1999\u20132007\n| team3 = [[Sacramento Monarchs]]\n| years4 = 2008\n| team4 = [[Seattle Storm]]\n| years5 = 2009\n| team5 = [[Indiana Fever]]\n| womensHOF = Griffith\n| highlights = \n* [[WNBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] (1999)\n* [[WNBA MVP]] (1999)\n* 8\u00d7 [[WNBA All-Star Game|WNBA All-Star]] ([[1999 WNBA All-Star Game|1999]]\u2013[[2001 WNBA All-Star Game|2001]], [[2003 WNBA All-Star Game|2003]]\u2013[[2007 WNBA All-Star Game|2007]])\n* [[WNBA]] champion (2005)\n* 2\u00d7 [[All-WNBA Team|All-WNBA First Team]] ({{WNBA Year|1999}}, {{WNBA Year|2005}})\n* 3\u00d7 [[All-WNBA Team|All-WNBA Second Team]] ({{WNBA Year|2000}}, {{WNBA Year|2001}}, {{WNBA Year|2004}})\n* [[WNBA Finals MVP]] (2005)\n* [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA's All-Decade Team]]\n| medal_templates =\n{{MedalSport|Women's [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|basketball]]}}\n{{MedalCountry | the {{USA}} }}\n{{MedalOlympic}}\n{{MedalGold|[[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney]]|[[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|National team]]}}\n{{MedalGold|[[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens]] | [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|National team]]}}\n| wnba_profile = yolanda_griffith\n}}\n\n'''Yolanda Evette Griffith''' (born March 1, 1970) is an American professional [[basketball]] hall of fame player who played in both the [[American Basketball League (1996\u20131998)|ABL]] and [[WNBA]].

She had a solid rookie season statistically, backing up starting [[point guard]] [[Teresa Weatherspoon]]. Her aggressive play at both ends of the court made her a favorite among Liberty fans. After the 2003 season, Hammon took over for Weatherspoon as the Liberty's starting point guard and, with [[Vickie Johnson]] and [[Crystal Robinson]], became one of the team's co-captains in 2004.\n\nIn her first season in 2003 with the Tennessee Fury of the [[National Women's Basketball League]] (NWBL), Hammon led the league in scoring, averaging 20.6 points per game.

Olympics Womens Basketball (Australia v Russia).jpg|thumb|Hammon at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]]]\nHammon was named to the team representing the United States at the 1998 [[William Jones Cup]] competition in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. The U.S. team, coached by [[Nell Fortner]], won all five games, earning the gold medal for the competition. Hammon scored 18 points over the five games.<ref name=\"1998 Jones Cup\">[http://archive.usab.com/womens/wjcup_1998.html \"1998 Women's R. William Jones Cup,\"] USA Basketball, August 3, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Decision to play for Russia===\nIn 2008, after learning that, once again, she would not be invited to try out for the [[United States women's national basketball team|U.S. national team]], Hammon announced she would try to claim a roster slot on the [[Russia women's national basketball team|Russian national team]] in the [[2008 Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. Hammon became a Russian citizen in 2008. The coach of Russia's team, Igor Grudin, is also the sports director of the CSKA team that Hammon plays for in Moscow during the WNBA off-season. Hammon also signed a three-year extension with [[WBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]] at around the same time she was named as a prospect for the national team.\n\nHammon's decision to play for Russia was controversial in American basketball.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://deadspin.com/5016800/becky-hammon-not-going-to-be-the-most-popular-gal-at-the-vfw|title= Hammon Not Going To Be The Most Popular Gal At The V.F.W|accessdate= 2010-10-31|publisher= deadspin.com}}</ref> In some circles she was branded an American traitor, with then-U.S. national coach [[Anne Donovan]] questioning her patriotism. \"If you play in this country, live in this country, and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a Russian uniform, you are not a patriotic person in my mind,\" Donovan said.<ref name=espn>{{cite web|url= http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=3427182/|title= Olympics opportunity too much for Hammon to pass up|accessdate= 2010-10-31|publisher= espn.com}}</ref>\n\nHammon responded to Donovan's criticism saying, \"You don't know me. You don't know what that flag means to me. You don't know how I grew up. The biggest honor in our classroom was who could put up the (American) flag, roll it up right, not let the corners touch the ground. Obviously we definitely define patriotism differently.\" She has also stated. \"I love my country. I love our national anthem. It absolutely gives me chills sometimes. I feel honored to be an American, to be from America because of what we stand for.\"<ref name=espn/> Hammon said she played for Russia primarily to play on the Olympic stage, and it was not a purely financial decision. However, by obtaining [[Russian citizenship]], her salary with CSKA tripled, and she was eligible to make $250,000 for winning a gold medal for Russia. She would have received a $150,000 bonus for winning a silver medal.<ref name=espn/>\n\nSince then, Anne Donovan has changed her position, stating \"I don't know that I have any strong thoughts on [Becky Hammon joining the Russian national team] anymore. Even at the time. I've known marathon runners in particular that I've watched over the years have represented other countries. I've watched other athletes do it.\"<ref name=\"usab2008-08-21\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usabasketball.com/womens/national/08_woly_07_quotes.html|title=USA Woman's national team: USA 67, Russia 52|publisher=USA Woman's Basketball|date=2008-08-21|accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref>\nShe also said<blockquote>The thing that took me off guard with Becky was that it hasn't happened in women's basketball before. And again, the {{sic|facts |hide=y|around}} that: that we didn't ask her to participate, that we didn't ask her to try out for our team, that's really what I had the most issue with. Becky made a great business decision and this was a great opportunity for her to get to the Olympic Games. I hold no grudge and more power to her. But the {{sic|facts |hide=y|around}} it when it first came out were not accurate. Becky came, had a great experience; I'm glad we're going to the gold medal game.<ref name=\"usab2008-08-21\"/></blockquote>\n\nHammon shot 1-for-6 from the field in a 67\u201352 loss to the United States in the 2008 Olympic Semifinals, but helped the Russian team to win the bronze medal by scoring 22 points against China.\n\nShe has since played for Russia at [[EuroBasket Women 2009|EuroBasket in 2009]], the [[2010 FIBA World Championship for Women|World Championship in 2010]] and the [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Olympics in 2012]].\n\n==Awards and achievements==\n[[File:Becky Hammon (bolshoisport) 4.JPG|thumb|Hammon in [[CSKA Moscow]] clothing]]\n;2005\n*Jersey retired by Colorado State University\n*Won the NWBL Championship with the Colorado Chill\n*Named to All WNBA 2nd Team\n\n;2006\n*Won 2nd NWBL Championship with the Colorado Chill\n*Named NWBL MVP\n\n;2007\n*Won World League Championship with CSKA\n*Named to All WNBA 1st Team\n\n;2008\n*Led the San Antonio Silver Stars to the best record in the WNBA and to San Antonio's first ever Western Conference Championship\n*Made the Guinness World Record for Most Free Throws Made in a Minute (women\u2019s category) after hitting 38 of 42 attempts in the allotted 60 seconds on February 16 at the NBA All-Star Jam Session\n*Voted into Euroleague All-Star Game\n*Won the Cup of Russia with CSKA\n*Silver Medalist in the Russian League Championships\n*Won the 2008 Haier Shooting Stars Competition along with David Robinson and Tim Duncan\n*Chosen as Athlete of the Year by the Rapid City Journal\n*Named to All WNBA 2nd Team\n\n;2009\n*Voted into the EuroLeague All-Star Game\n*Won the EuroLeague All-Star 3 Point Shoot Out\n*Voted into the WNBA All-Star Game\n*Won the WNBA All-Star Game 3 Point Shoot Out\n*Named to the All WNBA 1st Team\n\n;2010\n*Voted into the 2010 EuroLeague All-Star Game (Did not play)\n*Won the 2010 Haier Shooting Stars Competition at the NBA All-Star Weekend with Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Smith\n*Inducted into the South Dakota High School Basketball Hall of Fame\n*Named to the WNBA All-Star Game (Did not play due to injury)\n\n;2011\n*Named to the WNBA's exclusive Top 15 Players of All Time list\n\n;2012\n*Top vote-getter for the Silver Stars All-Decade Team\n\n;2013\n*After suffering a broken finger during a pre-season practice, Hammon made her 2013 WNBA season debut in Los Angeles on July 6\n*Hammon tore her ACL on July 13 and missed the remainder of the season\n\n;2014\n*On July 23, Hammon announced that she will retire at the end of the 2014 season\n*On August 5, it was announced that Hammon will serve as assistant coach of the NBA San Antonio Spurs\n*On August 22, Hammon was award the [[Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award]]<ref name=\"Kim Perrot Award\">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=Aug 22, 2014 |title=Becky Hammon Leaves Legacy in Final Season; Receives 2014 Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award|url=http://www.wnba.com/news/becky_hammon_kim_perrot_2014_08_22.html|work=WNBA.com|publisher=|accessdate=25 Aug 2014}}</ref>\n*ESPNW Woman of the Year <ref>Burke, Doris.

The 1998 championship was Tennessee's first ever undefeated season at 39\u20130 and also set an NCAA record for the most wins ever in a season. She also helped lead Tennessee to two SEC regular season titles in 1998 and 1999 and to three SEC tournament championships in 1996, 1998 and 1999.\n\nAt Tennessee, Holdsclaw was a four-time Kodak All-America, one of only six women's basketball players to earn the honor (along with teammate [[Tamika Catchings]], [[Cheryl Miller]] of [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[Ann Meyers]] of [[UCLA]], [[Lynette Woodard]] of [[University of Kansas|Kansas]] and [[LaToya Thomas]] of [[Mississippi State University|Mississippi State]].)

However, she returned just in time for one game in the [[2009 WNBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. The Dream lost to the [[Detroit Shock]].\n\nOn May 19, 2010, she was released from the Dream after requesting a trade and did not report to the team.

[[Minnesota Lynx]] in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA).\n\n==Early years==\nAt the age of three, Jones began playing basketball in a local park. Born in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]], she began playing AAU ball at the age of eleven, but she was playing neighborhood ball before then. She tried to interest the girls in playing, but couldn't convince them, so she played basketball with the boys. By the age of twelve, she reached her adult height, so she was taller than most of her teammates, boys and girls. Her shoe matched her age for a time, until she peaked out at size 13.<ref name=HuffPost/>\n\nShe started going to basketball camps at an early age, including one at Rutgers while she was in fifth grade. When she was in eighth grade, she was good enough to win the MVP of her summer league, despite playing with high school age participants.<ref name=Riley/>\n\n==High school and AAU==\nJones attended [[Piscataway Township High School]] and holds the school record of points and rebounds with 2,266 and 1,256 respectively.<ref>[http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/asjha_jones/bio.html Asjha Jones profile], [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. Accessed September 6, 2007. \"A Parade, USA Today and Street & Smith First Team All-American at Piscataway High School, averaging 22.2 points, 11.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2.5 blocks and 2.9 steals\u2026Scored a school career-record 2,266 points and had 1,256 rebounds.\"</ref> As a senior, Jones played on the high school team that went to the stale finals. In the semi-final game against the Shawnee Renegades, the opposing team knew they had to contain Jones. While they were successful in limiting her shots from the field (Jones was 3 for 18), they could not stop her rebounding or free throw shooting. Jones had 15 rebounds and hit 6 of 7 free throws to help lead the Piscataway team past Shawnee and on to the finals.<ref name=\"HS semi\"/>\n\nIn high school, she was a [[McDonalds All-American]] and The Star-Ledger New Jersey Girls Basketball Player of the Year, earning her a scholarship to the [[University of Connecticut]]. Jones was named a [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]] All-American. She participated in the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association#WBCA High School All-America Game|WBCA High School All-America Game]], where she scored seven points.<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\"/>\n\nJones came to the attention of a local AAU coach, Rich Leary, when she was a freshman in high school. At the time, there was an AAU team for boys, but not one for girls. So initially, she played with the boys. Leary formed a girls team, the Demons,  with Jones as the centerpiece. By the time she was a junior, the Demons won the under-18 state tournament and advanced as far as the national AAU finals. The following year, Jones averaged 30 points a game and lead the team to the national tournament again.<ref name=Riley/>\n\n==College==\nJones was highly recruited around the country. As a high school star in Piscataway, the home of [[Rutgers University]], it was natural that Rutgers would be interested in persuading Jones to join their team. Recruiting of top athletes is a multi-year process, often starting before players enter high school. When Jones was  a freshman at Piscataway, the Rutgers head coach was [[Theresa Grentz]], a highly regarded coach who had served as the Olympic Coach in 1992. However, Grentz moved to [[university of Illinois|Illinois]] in 1995, and future [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] coach [[C. Vivian Stringer]] became the head coach of Rutgers. Although Rutgers continued to pursue Jones, along with many other schools, Jones decided she would prefer to play somewhere other than home.<ref name=Riley/> Jones accepted a scholarship offer from [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]], and became one of a highly heralded recruiting class, including [[Sue Bird]], [[Tamika Raymond|Tamika (Williams) Raymond]], [[Swin Cash]], and Keirsten Walters.\n\nWhile at UConn she played in every game since her sophomore season (144) breaking the UConn record for all-time games played (138) by Carla Berube (since broken by [[Ashley Battle]]), and helped lead her team, known as the ''Huskies'', to two [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship]]s in 2000 and 2002.\n\nIn the Big East Championship title game in 2002, the UConn team came to the game having won its first 32 games of the season. The opponent, Boston College, had a record of 23\u20136, and was ranked 17th in the nation. The game was never close. UConn scored four seconds into the game, hit their first six shots and ten of their first eleven. The final margin of victory was 42 points, breaking the tournament record of 36. The Tournament MVP honors were awarded to Jones, who scored 19 points and had 11 rebounds.<ref name=BET/>\n\nThat year, the UConn team would finish the season undefeated. The team was dominant enough to prompt Sports Illustrated to call UConn \"one of the best in history\" before the final game of the season was played. Although the national championship game was against Oklahoma, the semi-final was against long-time rival Tennessee. SI's Richard Deitsch called Jones \"the best player on the floor against Tennessee\".<ref name=SI/>\n\nSports Illustrated did a series of thirteen photographs featuring players and team member of teams chasing or achieving perfect seasons\u2014an entire season without a loss. The photograph of the 2002 team including Asjha Jones  is one of the photos in the collection.<ref name=\"SI Perfection\"/>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===International===\nIn the 2005\u201306 off-season she played in [[Novosibirsk]] for the Russian Basketball Federation Superleague. After playing for [[UMMC Ekaterinburg]] in Russia during several years, she joined [[Rivas Ec\u00f3polis]] in the 2011\u201312 off-season, where she played the Final game of the [[EuroLeague Women 2011\u201312]].<ref name = \"offseason\"/>\n\n==USA Basketball==\nJones was invited to the USA Basketball Women's National Team training camp in the fall of 2009.<ref name=\"National Team\">{{cite web|url=http://usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=09_wnt_fall_invitees_add_rm|title=USA Basketball Women's National Team To Tip-Off Training Tomorrow In D.C.|publisher=USA Basketball|accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref> The team selected to play for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics is usually chosen from these participants. At the conclusion of the training camp, the team will travel to Ekaterinburg, Russia, where they compete in the 2009 UMMC Ekaterinburg International Invitational.<ref name=\"National Team\" />\n\nJones was initially selected as one of the twenty players in the national team pool, from which the twelve members of the USA National team would be selected.<ref name=\"National Team Pool\"/>  Jones had to do something she had never done in her life\u2014try out for a team. She chuckled as she explained, \"None of us have ever had to try out for a basketball team in our life...It's a new experience having to try out and worry if they like you.\"<ref name=\"Trying out\"/> She made the team, and played in the 2010 World Championships in the [[Czech Republic]]. The team was coached by [[Geno Auriemma]] who was Jones' college coach. The team was dominant, winning all nine games with an average margin of victory over 35 points. Jones averaged just over five points per games, on 57.9% shooting from the field.<ref name=\"FIBA World\"/><ref name=\"FIBA Stats\"/>\n\nJones was one of 21 finalists for the 2012 U.S. Women's Olympic Basketball Team Roster. The 20 professional women's basketball payers, plus one collegiate player ([[Brittney Griner]]), were selected by the USA Basketball Women's National Team Player Selection Committee to compete for the final roster which will represent the USA at the 2012 Olympics in London.<ref name=\"Olympic Roster finalists\"/> On April 23, 2012 Jones was the final member of the 12-player USA team to be selected.  She was part of the US team that won the gold medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.olympic.org/olympic-results/london-2012/basketball/basketball-w|title = London 2012 \u2013 Basketball \u2013 Women's Basketball|date = |accessdate = 25 December 2014|website = www.olympic.org|publisher = IOC|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n===WNBA===\nJones was selected in the first round (4th overall pick) by the [[Washington Mystics]] in the 2002 [[WNBA Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/draft2003/mystics_draft_history.html#2002|title=Washington Mystics Draft History |accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref> The third pick by the Mystics was [[Stacey Dales]], who said about Jones, \"\"Ashja Jones is one of the toughest players I've ever come up against,\" Dales-Schuman said. \"Her physical nature, her stature, her mentality of the game, she's an exceptional player, and I see her as being a tremendous professional athlete.\"<ref name=OU/>\n\nAfter spending two seasons with the Mystics, Jones was traded to the [[Connecticut Sun]] in a three-team deal that sent Tamicha Jackson from the [[Phoenix Mercury]] to the [[Washington Mystics]] and the Sun sent the 8th pick in the 2004 [[WNBA Draft]] to the Mercury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/transactions/WNBA_2004.html|title=2004 WNBA Transactions|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Jones was the leading scorer for the Sun team, with 16.7 points per game.<ref name=\"Sun stats 2009\"/> Unfortunately, she strained her left Achilles tendon, and had to miss the final eleven games of the season.<ref name=Surgery/> She underwent surgery in the following February. She didn't fully recover during the 2010 season, but still managed to average double-digit scoring.<ref name=\"Sun stats 2010\"/> Jones decided to take a break, and decided not to play in the European league during the winter. The break helped her heal for the 2011 season, where she is the third leading scorer at just over 13 points per game.<ref name=\"Sun stats 2011\"/> Her coach, [[Mike Thibault]], says \"I want a championship for Asjha as much as I want it for anybody...She's one of my favorite players I've ever coached, because of the way she approaches her job every single day.\"<ref name=Jacobs/>\n\nOn May

Lennox''' (born December 4, 1976) is an American professional basketball player most recently playing for the [[Tulsa Shock]] in the [[WNBA]]. Her nicknames include \"Betty Basketball,\" \"Betty Big Buckets,\" and her most popular nickname \"B-Money.\"\n\n==Childhood==\nBorn in [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma, Lennox grew up in the small town of [[Grant, Oklahoma|Grant]].  Daughter of Bernice Jefferies and A. B. Lennox, and was raised by her mother primarily.  She was the eighth of nine children and the youngest daughter in the family.  She has five brothers, named Freddy, Karl, A. B., Alfred, and Charles.  She also has three sisters named Lela, Ruby, and Victoria, all of them older than she is.  She learned to play basketball with her four older brothers and one younger, who did not cut her any slack because she was a girl.  She would learn to not be intimated by others while playing with her brothers as a child.  She also developed her work ethic from growing up on a farm with her family.  She was loading bales by age ten, each bale weighing 30 to 40 pounds, and did many daily chores while in primary school in Grant.  Her full name is Betty Bernice Lennox, getting her middle name from her mother.\n\n==High school career==\nBetty spent three years attending [[Fort Osage High School]] in [[Independence, Missouri]], under the coaching of Dale Williams. Betty played her sophomore year at Grant High School in Grant, OK.  She originally learned the six-player game of basketball while in Oklahoma.  She struggled when her family moved to Missouri, as she was not used to crossing over the center line to be a defensive player, as she had only been an offensive player while in Oklahoma.\n\n==College years==\nLennox played college basketball at [[Trinity Valley Community College]] in [[Athens, Texas]] for her sophomore year. Trinity Valley was actually her second community college, as she originally enrolled and played her Freshman year at [[Butler Community College]] in Kansas garnering all conference honors. She would transfer to Trinity Valley CC after her freshman year in 1996. Her Cardinals Trinity Valley CC team won the 1997 [[NJCAA Women's Basketball Championship]], an accomplishment she is most proud of. She was the MVP of the tournament, and finished the championship game with 27 points and 20 rebounds. Lennox then transferred to [[Louisiana Tech University]], and graduated from there in 2000 with a BA in Psychology. She actually took a year off from basketball while at LA Tech in 1998 to devote herself to her studies in order to complete her degree. She would play basketball for LA Tech for her final two years of college in 1999 & 2000.  She was named the 2000 Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year and a U.S. Basketball Writers Association First Team All-American while at [[Louisiana Tech University]].\n\n==WNBA career==\nLennox was selected by the [[Minnesota Lynx]] as the sixth overall pick in the 2000 [[WNBA Draft]] and later became the WNBA's [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]] in 2000.  She was also the first Rookie to ever play in the [[2000 WNBA All-Star Game]] that same year.  She also made the All-WNBA 2nd Team in 2000 as well.  She broke her hip in 2001, and was originally told that her basketball career would be over after the injury.  With the work ethic she learned as a child, she fought back from her injury to come back and continues to thrive as a player.\n\nOn June 13, 2002, the [[Minnesota Lynx]] traded Lennox along with a 2003 first-round draft pick to the [[Miami Sol]] in exchange for [[Tamara Moore]] and a 2003 second-round draft pick. After the 2002 season ended, the [[Miami Sol]] folded, and Lennox was selected by the [[Cleveland Rockers]] in the 2003 WNBA [[Dispersal draft]]. When the Rockers folded after the 2003 season ended, Lennox went through another Dispersal Draft before the 2004 season. This time, she was selected by the [[Seattle Storm]].  The Seattle Storm would reach the WNBA quarterfinals with Lennox for both the 2005 and 2006 seasons.\n\nLennox led the [[Seattle Storm]] to the [[2004 WNBA Championship]] against the [[Connecticut Sun]]. She was named the [[WNBA Finals|Finals]] Most Valuable Player, and averaged 22.3 points during the Storm's championship run en route to winning the award.

She is a three-time WNBA [[WNBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] and a four-time Olympic gold medal winner. The number-seven pick in the 1997 inaugural WNBA draft, she followed her career at the [[University of Southern California]] with eight WNBA All-Star selections and two [[WNBA Championship|WNBA championships]] over the course of eleven seasons with the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], before retiring in 2009.<ref name=\"nbc\" /> Leslie, a 6'5\" center, is the first player to dunk in a WNBA game.  She was considered a pioneer and cornerstone of the league during her WNBA career. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in WNBA history. In 2015, she was elected to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early years==\nLeslie is the daughter of Christine Lauren Leslie, who stood 6&nbsp;ft 3 in, and Walter Leslie, a semi-professional basketball player.  Christine started her own [[truck driver|truck driving]] business to support her three children. Walter left the family when her mother was four months pregnant with her.<ref name=\"porter\" />  Leslie has two sisters: Dionne, who is five years older, and Tiffany, who is eight years younger. She also has a brother, Elgin, who is now the Carondelet high school basketball coach. Lisa played basketball on an all-boys basketball team in middle school. She also played on an all-girls team with the record 33-1.\n\n==Middle school==\nBy the time Leslie was in middle school in California, she had grown to over 6'1\" but never participated in athletic activities besides [[tetherball]] and [[Double Dutch (jump rope)|double Dutch]]. Her dream then was to be a television weather reporter.<ref name=\"jockbio\">{{cite web |url=http://jockbio.com/Bios/Leslie/Leslie_bio.html |title=Lisa Leslie Biography |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |work= |publisher=Black Book Partners |year=2008}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first few weeks of middle high, a classmate begged Leslie to help out the basketball team.<ref name=\"grundy\" /> On her first day of basketball tryouts, team members were told to split into two groups for layup drills: [[Handedness|lefties]] and [[Handedness|righties]]. Leslie was the only lefty in the group, so from then on, she decided to become right-hand dominant so she would not have to stand in a line by herself. That decision worked to her advantage, as she became ambidextrous.<ref name=\"lipstick\">Leslie, Lisa, and Larry Barnett. Don't Let the Lipstick Fool You. New York: Kensington Publishing Corp., 2008</ref>\n\nIn eighth grade, she transferred to a junior high school without a girls' basketball team, and joined a boys' basketball team. Her success there contributed to her confidence in her playing abilities.<ref name=\"lipstick\" />\n\n==High school==\nAt 14, before Leslie had even started high school at Morningside, she received more than a hundred college recruiting letters, including some from top [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] programs at the [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|University of Tennessee]] and [[Stanford University]].<ref name=\"lipstick\" />\n\nLeslie continued her education in 1986 by enrolling at [[Morningside High School]] in [[Inglewood, California]].<ref name=\"porter\" /> She made an immediate impact on the basketball program, starting every game for the girl's varsity team. She also found time to join the volleyball team and compete in track and field. She ended up being a state qualifier in the 400-meter run and the high jump.<ref name=\"jockbio\" />\n\nBy the time she was a sophomore in high school, she was able to dunk the ball in the open court, even though she was not able to palm the ball. She was her team's leading scorer and rebounder and led them to the 1989 California state championship. Leslie was so talented that she was invited to participate in the USA's Junior World Championship team.<ref name=\"jockbio\" />  Entering her senior year, she developed into the top player in the country. She led her team to a state championship averaging 27 points and 15 rebounds per game.<ref name=\"porter\" />\n\n==College==\nLeslie decided to stay close to home and attend women's  basketball powerhouse the [[University of Southern California]] from 1990\u20131994.<ref name=\"meyer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.makeithappen.com/wis/bios/lesliel.html |title=Women in Sports |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |author=Meyer, Jan |publisher= |year=1997}}</ref> She graduated from USC with a bachelor's degree in communications and later completed her master's degree in business administration<ref name=\"peter\">{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/news?slug=jo-leslie072108&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Day in the life of Lisa Leslie |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |author=Peter, Josh |publisher=Yahoo |date=July 21, 2008}}</ref> from the [[University of Phoenix]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7DE113CF934A25752C0A96F9C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all SPORTS OF THE TIMES; University Sells Itself During Playoffs] NYTimes Website, Accessed March 20, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.wireimage.com/ItemListings.aspx?igi=66148&nbc1=1 [[Los Angeles Sparks]] Lisa Leslie Receives her Masters at University of Phoenix] WireImage Website, Accessed March 20, 2009</ref>\n\nLeslie played in a total of 120 college games, averaging 20.1 points, hitting 53.4% of her shots, and knocking down 69.8% of her free throws.

She was 17 at the time, the youngest player on the USA team. The team participated in the second Junior World Championship, held in [[Bilbao]], Spain in July 1989. The USA team lost their opening game to South Korea in overtime, then lost a two-point game to Australia. After winning their next game against Bulgaria, behind 22 points and nine rebounds from Leslie, the USA team again fell in a close game, losing by three points to Czechoslovakia. After beating Zaire in their next game, the USA team played Spain, and fell three points short. Leslie led the team in scoring, rebounds, and blocks, averaging 13.3 points and 7.0 rebounds per game and recording 21 blocks over the course of the event. The USA team finished in seventh place.<ref name=\"1989 U19\" />\n\nLeslie was a member of the USA team competing at the 1991 [[USA Women\u2019s World University Games Team|World University Games]] held in [[Sheffield]], England.

Both her parents were teachers; in addition, her father was a basketball coach.<ref name=\"porter285\"/> Raised in [[Southwick, Massachusetts]], Lobo was the state scoring record-holder with 2,740 points in her high school career for [[Southwick-Tolland Regional High School]] in [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"porter285\"/> She held this record for 18 years until it was eclipsed by Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir of the new Leadership Charter School in Springfield on January 26, 2009.<ref name=\"record break\"/>\n\n==College==\nMore than 100 colleges recruited Lobo, but she chose the [[University of Connecticut]] due to proximity and her belief in its academic excellence.<ref name=\"porter285\"/> She helped lead the [[Connecticut Huskies|Huskies]] to the 1995 [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|National Championship]] with an undefeated 35-0 record.  In her senior year, she won the 1995 [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]] and College Player of the Year award. Lobo was awarded the prestigious [[Honda-Broderick Cup]] for 1994-95, presented to the athlete \"most deserving of recognition as the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year\".<ref name=\"NYT\"/> She was a member of the inaugural class of inductees to the University of Connecticut women's basketball \"Huskies of Honor\" recognition program.<ref name=\"Huskies of Honor\"/> Lobo was named the 1995 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category) by the Women's Sports Foundation.<ref name=\"WSF\"/> Lobo was the first player in the Big East Conference ever to earn first team all American honors for both basketball and academics\n\n==USA Basketball==\nLobo was named to the USA U18 team (then called the Junior World Championship Qualifying Team) in 1992. The team competed in [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato, Mexico]] in August 1992. The team won their first four games, then lost 80\u201370 to Brazil, finishing with the silver medal for the event, but qualifying for the 1993 world games. Lobo averaged 6.8 points per game during the event.<ref name=\"1992 U18\"/>\n\nLobo continued with the team to the 1993 U19 World Championship (then called the Junior World Championship). The team won five games and lost two, but that left them in seventh place. Lobo averaged 7.7 points per game and recorded six blocks, highest on the team.<ref name=\"1993 U19\"/>\n\n==Professional==\nIn 1995 Lobo passed through tryouts to join the national team, which later became the US team for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, GA. Though her minutes on the floor were few, Lobo shared in the gold medal. In 1997, the WNBA was formed and enjoyed its inaugural season, and Lobo was assigned to the [[New York Liberty]] during the league's first player allocations on January 22, 1997.  The first season the Liberty fell to the Houston Comets in the WNBA Finals. Lobo suffered a setback in 1999, tearing her left [[anterior cruciate ligament]] and her meniscus in the first game of the season. In 1999, she was selected to the inaugural WNBA All Star team but could not play because of the injury.<ref name=\"NYT ACL\"/>  In 2002 she was traded to the [[Houston Comets]] in exchange for Houston\u2019s second-round selection (26th overall) in the [[2002 WNBA Draft]].  The next season she was traded to the [[Connecticut Sun]], where she retired in 2003. Lobo also played two seasons in the National Women's Basketball league with the Springfield Spirit 2002 through 2003.\n\n===Sports announcing===\nToday, Lobo is seen as a reporter and color analyst for [[ESPN]] with a focus on women's college basketball and WNBA games.\n\n===Women's Basketball Hall of Fame===\nLobo was inducted into the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the class of 2010.<ref name=\"Lobo WBHOF\"/><ref name=\"WBHOF\"/>\n\nAt the induction ceremony, Lobo was introduced by her college coach, [[Geno Auriemma]] who said, in part:\n\n{{quote|text=No one in all the years that I\u2019ve been there, has had the impact on the court and off the court, that Rebecca has had and has continued both in the WNBA, as being one of the founders, both as a representative of our university, as a member of the board of trustees, continuing to promote the game on ESPN, and all the other things that Rebecca has done to further the role model that she is, for all the young people that looked up to her, emulated what she has always been, a great student, a great athlete, a great person, someone that I\u2019ve cherished to have had the opportunity to work with, and to call my friend, and now to call my boss.|sign=[[Geno Auriemma]]|source=<ref name=\"Lobo Induction\"/>}}\n\nLobo talked about touring the museum and seeing the exhibit of the [[All American Red Heads Team]]. She talked about the influence of her grandmothers on her life, her parents, and others who helped her with her career.  Then she related an anecdote about her daughter, epitomizing how things have changed for women in the sports world:\n\n{{quote|text=But two years ago, a year and a half ago, my oldest daughter, who was 4 \u00bd, and my husband was watching UConn men, playing on the television in the living room, and my daughter walked in the room and looked at the TV and said to Steve, \"Are those boys playing?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"yes\".\n\nAnd my daughter said, \"I didn\u2019t know boys played basketball\".|sign=Lobo|source=<ref name=\"Lobo Induction\"/>}}\n\n==Family and personal life==\nOn April 12, 2003, Rebecca changed her last name from Lobo to Lobo-Rushin after marrying ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''  writer [[Steve Rushin]] at the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"marriage\"/>  They have four children (3 daughters and 1 son). In Steve Rushin's words: \"The first words Rebecca Lobo ever spoke to me when we met in a Manhattan bar in 2001 were: \"Aren't you the guy who just mocked women's basketball in Sports Illustrated?\" I blushed, broke out in a flop sweat and said, \"Yes.\"  A few weeks earlier, I had written that although Wilt Chamberlain claimed to have slept with 20,000 women in his lifetime, I had once slept with 7,138 women in a single night: We were all snoring in the stands at a WNBA game.  It was an appalling line, and I was eager to change the subject, but Lobo wouldn't let it go. \"We get 15,000 fans at Madison Square Garden,\" she said. \"How many women's games have you ever been to, anyway?\"  Hanging my head in shame, I admitted that I had never attended a women's basketball game before ridiculing it in a national magazine.  So she invited me to one of her New York Liberty games, I accepted, and 23 months later we were married.<ref name=\"Hartford\">{{cite web|last=Rushin|first=Steve|title=Lobo 'Schools' Sportswriter In Women's Game|url=http://articles.courant.com/2012-06-15/news/hc-op-rushin-rebecca-lobo-schools-on-womens-sports-20120615_1_women-basketball-game-title-ix|publisher=Hartford Courant|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Breast cancer advocate and health spokesperson==\nIn 1996, Lobo and her late mother, Ruth Ann Lobo, collaborated on a book entitled ''The Home Team'',<ref name=\"amazon\"/> which dealt with Ruth Ann's battle with [[breast cancer]].  They also founded the RuthAnn and Rebecca Lobo Scholarship, which offers a scholarship to the UConn School of Allied Health for Hispanic students.<ref name=\"dailynews\"/>\n\nRebecca was the 1996 spokesperson for the [[Lee National Denim Day]] fund raiser which raises millions of dollars for [[breast cancer]] research and education.\n\nStarting in 2000, Lobo served as national spokesperson and backer for Body1.com, a consumer-targeted network of sites providing interactive content-rich information on medical technologies that treat ailments and diseases specific to body parts. Due to her recurring problems with a torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]], (ACL), she campaigned to raise awareness of knee injury risks in women. Lobo shared her story with others suffering from the same type of injury and strongly advocated for patient self-education via the Internet.<ref name=\"acl\"/>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* 1994\u2014Kodak First team All-America<ref name=\"porter285\"/>\n* 1994\u2014[[Honda Sports Award]], basketball<ref name=\"Honda Sports Award\"/>\n* 1994\u2014Honda-Broderick Cup<ref name=\"NYT Honda\"/>\n* 1995\u2014ESPY Award\u2013Outstanding Female Athlete<ref name=\"porter285\"/>\n* 1995\u2014AP Female Athlete of the Year<ref name=\"porter285\"/>\n* 1995\u2014NCAA Women's Basketball Player of the Year<ref name=\"porter285\"/>\n* 1995\u2014Women's Sports Foundation\u2013Sportswoman of the Year<ref name=\"Sportswoman\"/>\n* 1995\u2014Wade Trophy<ref name=\"porter285\"/><ref name=\"Wade Trophy\"/>\n* 1995\u2014Kodak First team All-America<ref name=\"porter285\"/>\n* 1995\u2014[[Honda Sports Award]], basketball<ref name=\"Honda Sports Award\"/>\n* 1997\u2014All WNBA Second team<ref name=\"porter285\"/>\n* 1997\u2014WNBA Eastern All-Star team<ref name=\"porter285\"/>\n* 2010\u2014[[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Voepel|first1=Mechelle|title=Rebecca Lobo there from the start|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/w-in-action/article/9808817/rebecca-lobo-there-start-espnw|accessdate=December 9, 2014|publisher=ESPN.com|date=October 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==College statistics==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <hiddentext>generated with [[:de:Wikipedia:Helferlein/VBA-Macro for EXCEL tableconversion]] V1.7<\\hiddentext>\n|-  style=\"text-align:left;

She is the younger sister of former [[NBA]] player [[Anthony Parker]]. She attended the [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville|University of Tennessee]] and was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] in 2008.  She may be best known for being the first woman to [[slam dunk|dunk]] in an [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] game and the first woman to dunk twice in a college game&mdash;she set both milestones as a [[redshirt freshman]] on March 19, 2006. She also became only the second player to dunk in a WNBA game on June 22, 2008.<ref name=\"si\">{{Cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/ian_thomsen/03/21/parker.draft/index.html|title=Parker has opportunity to declare for '07 WNBA draft|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=March 22, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref><ref name=\"sbee\">{{cite news |last=Gutierrez |first=Melody |title=College stars boost WNBA draft suspense |newspaper=The Sacramento Bee |date=April 2, 2007 |url=http://www.sacbee.com/100/story/147890.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080207023940/http://www.sacbee.com/100/story/147890.html|archivedate=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/news/overseas_0809.html |title=Offseason 2008-09: Overseas Roster |publisher=Wnba.com |date=January 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nA versatile player, she is mainly a forward, but was listed on Tennessee's roster as a forward, center, and guard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volnation.com/blog/tennessee-lady-vols-basketball-roster-2006/|title=2006-07 Lady Vols Roster|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref> She was a starter on the [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Lady Vols]] basketball team, winners of the 2007 and 2008 [[NCAA championships]].\n\nParker won the 2009 [[Teen Choice Awards]] as the favorite female athlete in the sports category, and was a guest star on various Nickelodeon Shows, such as [[Figure It Out]] and [[Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn]].\n\n==Early life==\nCandace Parker was born on April 19, 1986 to Sara and Larry Parker. She has two older brothers: [[Anthony Parker]], who is a former [[NBA]] basketball player, and Marcus Parker, who is a doctor.<ref name=\"Biography Today\">{{cite book |last=|first=|title=Biography Today|year=2010|page=143|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=[[Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7}}</ref>\n\nShe grew up in [[Naperville, Illinois]]. Her whole family loved basketball, and she began playing at an early age. Her father played basketball at the [[University of Iowa]] in the 1970s. The Parker family were also huge [[Chicago Bulls]] fans. Candace was worried about playing basketball, fearing she would not live up to the level of play her father and brother demonstrated, so she focused on playing soccer. It wasn't until the eighth grade that her family convinced her to play basketball. Her father helped coach and critique her. Parker said of the experience, \"He did things to make me mad, to challenge me, because I was so much more athletic and had so much more knowledge of the game than everyone else that sometimes I just coasted. If me and my dad went to a park and he didn't think I was practicing hard enough, he'd just get in the car and leave. And I'd have to run home. I mean run home. Once I figured that out, I'd always try to go to close-by-parks.\" <ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.144-145</ref>\n\n==High school career==\nLike her older brother [[Anthony Parker]], she attended [[Naperville Central High School]] in [[Naperville, Illinois]] in 2004. While in high school, Parker led her basketball team to Class AA state titles in 2003 and 2004, and compiled a school-record 2,768 points (22.9 points per game) and 1,592 rebounds (13.2 rebounds per game) while starting 119 of the 121 games in which she played.\n\nShe is the only two-time award winner of the [[USA Today]] High School Player of the Year, winning the award in 2003 and 2004. Parker also won the [[Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award]] and Gatorade Female Basketball Player of the Year Award in 2003 and 2004. In 2004 she was named Gatorade Female Athlete of the Year, [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]] All-American and [[McDonald's All-American]]. She participated in the 2004 WCBA All-America Game where she scored 9 points.<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\"/> She was also a consensus pick as player of the year in Illinois in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and was a four-year member of the All-State first team.\n\nOn December 27, 2001, Parker dunked for the first time in competition as a 15-year-old sophomore at Naperville Central High School, this is believed to be the first slam dunk by a female athlete in Illinois.\n\nOn July 11, 2003, Parker tore her [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] in her left knee in a summer league game. On November 11, Parker announced her commitment to [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville|Tennessee]] on [[ESPNEWS]], becoming the first women's player to announce the oral commitment live on ESPNEWS. On December 29, Parker returned to action for Naperville Central and a few months later, led her team to its second consecutive state title.\n\nOn March 29, 2004, Parker won the slam dunk contest at [[McDonald's All-American Game]], becoming the first female to win the event and beating the likes of [[Josh Smith]] and [[J. R. Smith]].\n\nIn August 2004, Parker led the undefeated USA Junior World Championship team to a gold medal with 16.6 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. While training, Parker had a relapse of knee pain and was required to undergo surgery both the lateral meniscus and the lateral articular cartilage in her left knee.\n\n==College career==\n\n===Redshirt Freshman Year===\nParker entered the [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville|University of Tennessee]] in 2004. On February 17, 2005, Tennessee announced Parker would redshirt her first season due to a knee injury. She started for the [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Tennessee Lady Vols]] during the 2005-06 season. On March 19, 2006, in an NCAA tournament first round game against Army, she became the first woman to dunk in an NCAA tournament game, then became the first woman to dunk twice in an NCAA tournament game.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.146\">\"Biography Today\", pp. 146</ref>\n\nShe was the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] Rookie of the Year (Coaches and AP) and helped the Lady Vols win the [[SEC Tournament|2006 SEC tournament championship]]. With 17 seconds remaining in the SEC tournament championship game against [[LSU Lady Tigers basketball|LSU]], Parker hit the game-winning shot. She was named tournament MVP and was named to the 2006 Kodak All-America team, making her one of the few to ever receive the award as a freshman. However, in the NCAA tournament regional finals against [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]], Parker got in early foul trouble and was out of the game for much of the first half, Tennessee ultimately lost the game.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:candace&nicky.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Candace and [[Nicky Anosike]] celebrate. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nParker was the only college player named to the USA squad for the [[2006 FIBA World Championship for Women]] in [[Brazil]]. The USA squad finished in third place.\n\n===Sophomore Year===\nOn January 28, 2007, in an away game against Alabama, Parker scored her 1,000th career point as a sophomore, making her the fastest player in Lady Vol history to do so. She did it in 56 games, beating [[Chamique Holdsclaw]]'s mark of 57 games and [[Tamika Catchings]]'s of 58 games. On March 1, at the SEC tournament in Duluth, Georgia, Parker was named the 2007 SEC Player of the Year. On April 3, she led the Lady Vols to their first National Championship victory since 1998, beating [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights|Rutgers]] 59\u201346, Parker finished the game with 17 points and earned the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] honor.\n\n===Junior Year===\n[[File:2008-W-NCAA-Final-Four-4-07-08.jpg|thumb|Parker (left) gets ready for the jump ball]]\nParker announced on February 21, 2008, that she would forgo her final season of eligibility at Tennessee in order to focus on the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] and pursue a professional career in basketball.

Parker was named to the All-WNBA second team and All-Defensive second team despite missing almost a full month, due to her maternity leave. She led the Sparks to the Western Conference Finals but lost in game three to the [[Phoenix Mercury]]. In the playoffs, Parker averaged 18 points and 10.7 rebounds per game.\n\n===2010 season===\nIn 2010, Parker missed most of the 2010 WNBA season due to a shoulder injury.\n\n===2011 season===\nIn 2011, Parker played her first six games. During the seventh game, with 5:56 left in the third quarter, Parker went down after grabbing a defensive rebound and making brief contact with [[Quanitra Hollingsworth]]. After getting an [[MRI]] on June 27, she found out she had a torn meniscus in her right knee. Six weeks later, she returned and played the remainder of the season.\n\n===2012 season===\nIn 2012, Parker played the full season and helped her team to a 24-10 record, making the playoffs as the second seed in the west. In the first round, they beat the [[San Antonio Stars]] two games to none. In the Western Conference Finals, against the [[Minnesota Lynx]], the Sparks lost two games to none, while Parker scored 33 points, grabbed 15 rebounds, and had 4 blocks in a must-win game two, which they lost, 80-79, therefore ending their season. Parker was very emotional following the loss, hugging her mother Sara with tears.\n\n===2013 season===\nOn July 27, 2013, in her sixth season, Parker played in her first All-Star game. She scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in a come from behind win for the West and was named WNBA All-Star MVP. The Sparks finished with the same record (24-10) as the year earlier, again earning the second seed in the Western Conference. On September 19, Parker was named the 2013 [[WNBA Most Valuable Player]]. Parker became the fifth player to earn multiple WNBA MVP awards, joining [[Lisa Leslie]] (3), [[Sheryl Swoopes]] (3), [[Lauren Jackson]] (3) and [[Cynthia Cooper-Dyke|Cynthia Cooper]] (2). The Sparks faced the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in the Western Conference Semifinals. In game one, at Staples Center, the Sparks lost, forcing them to win in game two, at Phoenix to stay in the series. In game two, Parker scored 31 points and had 11 rebounds to lead the Sparks to a win, bringing the series back to L.A. for a game three. In a nailbiter, the Sparks lost on a last second jumper by Phoenix rookie [[Brittney Griner]], ending the Sparks' season by one point for the second straight year.\n\n===2014 season===\nIn January 2014, Williams Group Holdings abruptly announced they would relinquish their ownership of the Sparks. For a brief time, the Sparks future in Los Angeles was in some jeopardy. Despite major uncertainty, a month later the team was purchased by an investment group including [[Magic Johnson]], with promises of bringing L.A a championship. The team went into the All-Star break with an unexpected 10-13 record. Immediately after the break, head coach [[Carol Ross]] was let go and General Manager and former player, [[Penny Toler]], assumed the position of coach for the remainder of the season. Parker led her team to finish with a 16-18 record and clinched the number 4 seed to head to the playoffs for the 14th time in franchise history and 6th time for Parker. Despite enormous effort from her in the series, they lost 72-75 in game one and 68-93 in game two to eventual champions, Phoenix Mercury, marking the second consecutive year the Mercury knocked the Sparks out of the playoffs in the semi-final round. Parker averaged 19.4 points, 7.1 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.3 blocks per game in the regular season.\n\n===2015 season===\nOn April 9, 2015, Parker announced she would miss an undetermined amount of the season to rest. She returned to the Sparks after the All-Star break on July 29. Despite missing more than half of the season, she filled the box score like no player ever had before. In 16 regular-season games, Parker set a career high of 6.3 assists per game, ranking 1st in the league, two more than her previous career high, a number that only 7 other players in WNBA history have matched; all except Parker were guards. Additionally, she averaged 19.4 points (4th), 10.1 rebounds (1st), 1.8 blocks (4th) and career high 1.9 steals (5th) per game. The Sparks had been struggling with a 3-15 record before her return, one of the worst records in franchise history. However, Parker managed to lead her team to the number 4 seed with a 14-20 record. The team put up incredible effort against the number 1 seed, Minnesota Lynx in the series, losing game one by only 2 points. In game two, Parker had 25 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Sparks past the Lynx 81-71 and force a game three. Despite leading all scorers with 28 points and had 13 rebounds, Parker couldn't help her team in game three as they lost to the Lynx 91-80.

Basketball Association|WNBA]]. She has also excelled on the [[Fenerbah\u00e7e Women's Basketball|Fenerbah\u00e7e Istanbul]] squad in Europe.<ref name=\"fenerbahce\"/> Powell joined the coaching staff of the [[Gonzaga University]] women's basketball team, where she coached for one year.<ref name=\"Zags staff\"/> At the end of the 2014 WNBA season, Powell joined the coaching staff on the University of Oregon women's basketball team (assisting head coach Kelly Graves) and retired from the WNBA.\n\n==High school==\nBorn in [[Sierra Vista, Arizona]], Powell played for [[Mountain Pointe High School]] in Phoenix, where she was named a [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]] All-American. She also was named a 2000 Parade Magazine First Team All-American in 2000 and the Arizona Player of the Century by the Arizona Republic.  She participated in the 2000 [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association#WBCA High School All-America Game|WBCA High School All-America Game]] where she scored fourteen points.<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\"/>\n\nIn addition, Powell during her high school years earned all-region selection in both tennis and track, won the state badminton singles championships in 1997, 1999 and 2000, won the state discus title in 2000, and was an Arizona 5A doubles runner-up in tennis in 2000.\n\n==College==\nPowell played the [[Basketball#Positions|forward position]] for [[Stanford University]] women's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] basketball team. During her tenure there, she broke many school records, was named an All-American three times, and won numerous awards. She majored in [[urban development|urban studies]].\n\nShe is the only female basketball player in [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]] history to have achieved multiple [[triple-double]] games (that is, 10 totals or more in three different statistical categories) during the same season.\n\n==WNBA career==\nPowell was picked No. 3 overall by the [[Charlotte Sting]] in the 2004 [[WNBA Draft]]. She was used by the Sting as a utility player, appearing in 31 games.\n\nOn March 3, 2005, she was traded to the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] in a multi-player deal. The trade greatly aided the Monarchs in the 2005 season while Powell enjoyed a breakout year and eventually was named the recipient of that year's [[WNBA Most Improved Player Award|WNBA's Most Improved Player award]]. She played a pivotal role in the Monarchs' 2005 [[WNBA Finals]] victory over the [[Connecticut Sun]].\n\nAlthough the Monarchs struggled in subsequent years, Powell's statistics continued to improve.  In 2009, with several of her teammates hobbled by injuries, Powell averaged 16.7 points per game and was the best free throw shooter in the WNBA with 97.9% of attempts made.  She also participated in the 2009 WNBA All-Star Game, where she scored 21 points off the bench.\n\nThe Monarchs ceased operations following their 2009 season.  The New York Liberty selected Nicole Powell with the first pick in the ensuing dispersal draft.  She was traded to the Tulsa Shock before the 2013 season and signed with the Seattle Storm before the 2014 season.\n\n==USA Basketball==\nPowell was a member of the [[USA Women's U18 and U19 teams|USA Women's U18]] team which won the gold medal at the FIBA Americas Championship in [[Mar Del Plata]], [[Argentina]]. The event was held in July 2000, when the USA team defeated Cuba to win the championship. Powell averaged 8.2 points per game and led the team in rebounding with 6.4 per game.<ref name=\"2000 U18\"/>\n\nPowell was named to the [[USA Women's U18 and U19 teams|USA Women's U19]] team which represented the USA in the 2001 U19 World's Championship, held in [[Brno, Czech Republic]] in July 2001. Powell scored 7.0 points per game, led the team in rebounding with 6.3 per game to help the USA team to a 6\u20131 record and the bronze medal.<ref name=\"2001 U19\"/>\n\nIn 2003, Powell helped the United States women's national basketball team win a [[silver medal]] at the [[Pan American Games]] in [[Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]].<ref name=\"2003 Pan Am\"/> She also helped national teams win a [[bronze medal]] (in the [[Czech Republic]]) and a [[gold medal]] (in [[Argentina]]) at two other international tournaments.\n\n==International career==\nDuring the 2008\u20132009 and 2009\u20132010 WNBA off-season, Powell contributed to Fenerbah\u00e7e's victories each year in the Turkish women's basketball league championship.  In 2007\u20132008 she played for CSKA Moscow in Russia, in 2006\u20132007 for Perfumerias Halcon Avenida in Spain, in 2005\u20132006 for Fenerbah\u00e7e for the first time, also winning the country's championship, and 2004\u20132005 Basket Spezia in Italy.

She is a retired American professional [[basketball]] player (a [[Center (basketball)|center]]), playing most recently for the [[Atlanta Dream]] in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). Her [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] team won the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA women's championship]] in 2001, and her [[Detroit Shock]] team won the [[WNBA Finals|WNBA championship]] in 2003 and 2006. Riley was the [[Most Valuable Player]] in the 2001 and 2003 championship series, becoming the first person to win the MVP awards in both the NCAA and the WNBA championships. She has also played on teams that won the [[National Women's Basketball League]] (NWBL) championship, the [[gold medal]] at the [[Olympic Games]], and the 2010 EuroCup Championship.\n\nIn March 2016, Riley participated in [[Mogul (website)|Mogul]]'s #[https://onmogul.com/iamamogul IAmAMogul] campaign for inspiring women to believe that they have the \"power to shape the world through their voices and actions.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onmogul.com/iamamogul|title=You'll Never Guess Which Celebs Want You To Be A Mogul|website=Mogul|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onmogul.com/stories/iamamogul-because-sports-are-a-powerful-platform-to-build-girls-confidence-by-ruth-riley|title=#IAmAMogul Because Sports Are A Powerful Platform To Build Girls' Confidence. By Ruth Riley|website=Mogul|access-date=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nRiley was born in [[Ransom, Kansas]] and grew up in [[Macy, Indiana]]. She has always been tall, measuring {{convert|25|in|cm|2}} at birth, and six feet (1.83 m) by the time she was 12 years old.<ref>Goldberg p 31</ref> While attending [[North Miami Middle/High School]] outside Denver, Indiana, she was on the basketball, [[volleyball]] and [[Track and field|track]] teams. It was in high school that she began her practice of wearing a headband while playing. During her four years at high school she scored 1,372 points, acquired 1,011 rebounds and blocked 427 shots.<ref>Goldberg p 31\u201332</ref> She averaged 26 points a game as a senior, and had her jersey number (25) retired by the high school.<ref>Goldberg p 32</ref>\n\n==College years==\nIn her freshman year at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], Riley played in all 32 of the team's games, starting in the final 26. Thereafter she was the starting center in all but one of Notre Dame's games. She was a mainstay of the team in all four years, and consistently ranked high in the nation among women basketball players in [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] percentage and blocked shots. In both her junior and senior years she was an [[Associated Press]] First Team All-American selection. As a senior, she won the [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith Award]] and was the Associated Press Player of the Year. In addition, she was the 2000-01 [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] Academic All-American of the Year for the University Division I.\n\nThe highlight of her college career came in the 2001 NCAA tournament. In the championship game, Notre Dame was trailing [[Purdue University|Purdue]], 66-64, when Riley scored the tying field goal. Then, with 5.8 seconds left and the score still tied, Riley drew a foul. She made both [[free throw]]s to give Notre Dame its final 68-66 edge and its first women's national championship.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/women/2001/ncaa_tourney/news/2001/04/01/riley_mvp_ap/ | work=CNN | title=Riley leads Notre Dame in biggest game of her career | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Notre Dame coach [[Muffet McGraw]], when asked about the critical play on which Riley was fouled, said, \"it's the same play we've been running all season. It's called: 'Get the ball to Ruth.'\"<ref>http://www.argonaut.uidaho.edu/archives/040301/sportsstory3.html</ref> Riley was the Most Outstanding Player of that year's [[Final Four]]. The only player in Notre Dame women's basketball history to score 2,000 career points and grab 1,000 career rebounds, Riley was a two-time first-team Academic All-American in both 2000 and '01. In 1999, Riley led the nation in field goal percentage shooting 68.3% to become the first Irish player to rank first in an NCAA statistical category.<ref>http://www.und.com/sports/w-baskbl/mtt/ruth_riley_11663.html</ref>\n\nRiley graduated from Notre Dame in 2001 with a degree in [[psychology]], having made the [[Dean's List]] every semester. She finished her Notre Dame career with 2,072 points, and school records for [[rebounds]] (1,007), blocked shots (370), and field goal percentage (.632).\n\n==Professional career==\n\n==Education==\nBachelor of Arts - Psychology - Summa Cum Laude - [[University of Notre Dame]] (2001)\n\nExecutive MBA \u2013Magna Cum Laude - [[University of Notre Dame]] (2016)\n\n\n===WNBA===\nOn April 20, 2001, Riley was selected by the [[Miami Sol]] as the fifth overall pick in the [[2001 WNBA Draft]]. She came off the bench for the first 12 games. On July 1, she made her first professional start, on the road against the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], and started for the rest of the season.\n\nHer second season (2002) was a difficult one. After playing well in the preseason, she broke a finger the day before the regular season started. She could not play for the Sol's first several games \u2013 the first time in her career she had missed a game because of an injury. She returned, playing with a splint on her hand, but lost her starting spot. During the WNBA's off-season, she played in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], [[Spain]].\n\nAfter Riley's second season with the Sol, that franchise folded. On April 25, 2003 the WNBA held a special one-round [[dispersal draft]], in which the remaining WNBA teams could select players from the Sol and from the [[Portland Fire]], which had also folded. The Detroit Shock, by virtue of having the worst regular-season record in the WNBA in 2002, received the first pick in the dispersal draft, and used it to select Riley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/draft2003/lottery_and_dispersal_030424.html|title=WNBA.com: Draft 2003|website=www.wnba.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref>\n\nIn Riley's first season with the Shock (2003), she was a key member of the team. She bettered each of her previous WNBA season totals in points, rebounds, blocked shots, and assists. The Shock, in a notable turnaround, went from a 2002 season with the worst record in the league (9-23) to a 2003 season with the best record (25-9) and a victory in the WNBA Championship. In the finals, the Shock defeated the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Sparks to win Detroit's first WNBA title. Riley was named the [[WNBA Finals|MVP of the WNBA finals]].\n\nRiley continued to play for the Shock in the 2004, 2005, and 2006 seasons. In 2005 she was selected for the Eastern Conference team in the [[Women's National Basketball Association All-Star Game|WNBA All-Star Game]]. In 2006, she was the starting center when the Shock won its second WNBA championship, defeating the [[Sacramento Monarchs]].\n\nIn February 2007, she was traded to the [[San Antonio Silver Stars]] in exchange for [[Katie Feenstra]]. The Shock also received the right to exchange first-round draft picks with the Silver Stars in 2008. The [[Chicago Sky]] signed the veteran 6-foot-5 center and two-time WNBA champion Riley, the team announced on Monday February sixth 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070223/SPORTS04/702230427|title=Detroit Free Press - Home|website=Detroit Free Press|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref>\n\nRiley was waived by Chicago on 5/23/13.\n\nOn June 18, 2013, Riley signed with Atlanta after a roster spot opened up when [[Sancho Lyttle]] was suspended following her departure to play six games for her national team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/dream/news/dreamsignsriley061813.html|title=DREAM: Atlanta Dream Signs Former All-Star Center Ruth Riley|website=www.wnba.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref>\n\n===NWBL===\nThe WNBA off-season was when the National Women's Basketball League operated. It provided a showcase for players hoping to make a WNBA team, and also attracted established WNBA players. In the fall of 2003, Riley joined the [[Colorado Chill]] of the NWBL. On April 1, 2005, in her second season, the Chill won the NWBL championship.\n\nIn Riley's third season with the Chill, she broke her thumb in a preseason workout and missed the team's first 14 games. She returned to action on March 21, 2006.<ref>http://www.coloradoan.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060322/SPORTS/603220328/1006</ref> She played in the last four regular-season games, all of which the Chill won to finish tied for the regular-season championship.<ref>http://www.coloradoan.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060327/SPORTS/603270336/1006</ref> In the playoffs, the Chill won both its games to repeat as NWBL champions.<ref>http://www.coloradoan.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060331/SPORTS/60331011/1002/rss</ref> Riley was named as the playoff MVP.<ref>http://www.coloradoan.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060401/SPORTS/604010329/1006/rss02</ref>\n\n===Spanish League===\nAfter the WNBA's 2005 season, Riley played for [[Yaya Maria Porta XI]] in the 2005-06 season of the [[Liga Femenina de Baloncesto|Spanish League]]. In January 2009 she signed for [[Rivasec\u00f3polis]], and played again in the Spanish League.\n\n===Polish League===\nRiley played the 2006-07 European season for [[Lotos VBW Clima Gdynia|Lotos Gdynia]] in the [[Torell Basket Liga|Polish League]]. This club was long the European home for fellow WNBA player [[Margo Dydek]], and also at one time featured another American WNBA star in [[Katie Smith]].\n\n===Greek league===\nIn January 2010, the Athinaikos club in the Greek league announced that Riley would join it for the remainder of its season.

It invests in community organizations fighting hunger, teaches families how to cook healthy meals on a budget, and builds public-private partnerships to end hunger on a national and state level.  Riley, stopped by the booth to take the No Kid Hungry pledge and found out that they were launching an Illinois Initiative that March.  She offered to help in any way she could and was subsequently asked to speak at their at the official launch.  In the summer of 2012, Ruth, along with the NBA/WNBA joined with Share Our Strength to connect more than 50,000 youth to free meals in the summer across the United States.\n\n==Other activities==\n[[Image:Angola Basketball dedication 2007.jpg|right|thumb|Riley at the ribbon cutting for four donated basketball courts in Angola]]\nRiley wrote a [[Children's literature|children's book]], ''The Spirit of Basketball'', with co-author Paul Hickey and illustrator Christopher Hiller, that was published in 2005.

Her primary position is the [[small forward]].  Her second position is [[shooting guard]]. In 1999 Sales was added to the roster of the USA FIBA Senior National Team. Her brother Brooks Sales played forward for [[Villanova Wildcats|Villanova]] from 1998\u20132002, and currently plays overseas in [[Spain]] for the [[CB Breog\u00e1n|Club Baloncesto Breog\u00e1n]] of [[Lugo]].<ref>[http://www.cbbreogan.com/breogan/plantilla/sales-brooks-jefferson--52.html Brooks Sales on cbbreogan.com]</ref>\n\n==High school==\nSales attended Bloomfield High School in Bloomfield, Connecticut, and was a letterman in basketball. In basketball, she was named the [[usa today|USA Today]] High School National Player of the Year as a senior.<ref name=\"Players\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/nykesha_sales/bio.html|title=Players|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref> Sales was named a High School All-American by the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]]. She participated in the WBCA  High School All-America Game in 1994, scoring twenty-one points.<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\"/>\n\n==College==\nSales attended the [[University of Connecticut]] (UConn) as a business major from 1994-98.  She was a member of the powerhouse UConn women's basketball team, \"The Huskies\".\n\nIn 1995 she helped lead UConn to a [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship]] as well as a [[Final Four]] appearance in the 1996 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Tournament. She was named Rookie of the Year in 1995.  In 1997 she was a member of the Gold medal USA Women's World University Games. In 1997-98 she helped the team make two [[Elite Eight]] appearances. In the 1997-98 season, she was named to the [[All-America]]n first team, Defensive Player of the Year, and also the BIG EAST Player of the Year. She was also named to the 1996-97 and 1997-98 Kodak All-America teams. Sales was a member of the inaugural class (2006) of inductees to the University of Connecticut women's basketball \"Huskies of Honor\" recognition program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uconnhuskies.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/103008aaa.html|title=Women's Basketball 1995 National Championship Team to be Recognized as \"Huskies of Honor\"|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref>\n\n==Scoring Record Controversy==\nSales left college as UConn\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 2,178 career points. She scored the record-breaking points as part of a staged controversial layup.  Sales had suffered an injury that had essentially ended her collegiate career.  UConn's next game (against [[Villanova University]]) began with Villanova permitting Sales to complete an uncontested layup.  (UConn then returned the favor, allowing Villanova to score.  The game essentially began with a 2-2 score before serious play commenced.) UConn head coach [[Geno Auriemma]] felt bad that Sales did not already have the record, as he had made her sit on many occasions to avoid running up the score. The staged basket, while questioned in retrospect, was his attempt to make it up to her. He contacted the previous record holder, [[Kerry Bascom]], as well as the Big East Commissioner to ensure that the incident would not be a problem, although the media was, and to a degree continues to be, critical of the move.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Auriemma| first=G. |author2=MacMullan, J.  | year=2006 | title=Geno: In pursuit of Perfection | publisher=Warner Books |pages=138 | isbn=0-446-57764-2 }}</ref> Sales' record would eventually be broken by [[Tina Charles (basketball)|Tina Charles]].\n\nIncidentally, Sales wore #24 in high school, the same number worn by Kerry Bascom at Connecticut. When Sales was considering going to Connecticut, she was respectful enough of Bascom's position, that she asked if she could wear #42, reversing the digits, rather than asking to wear #24.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Auriemma| first=G. |author2=MacMullan, J.  | year=2006 | title=Geno: In pursuit of Perfection | publisher=Warner Books |pages=109 | isbn=0-446-57764-2 }}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nSales' record-breaking controversy was later parodied in an episode of the TV series ''[[King of the Hill (TV series)|King of the Hill]]'', where an injured Arlen High School football player is allowed to score a touchdown to break the school's all-time record that was previously held by [[Bill Dauterive]] despite protests from Bill's teammates (most notably [[Hank Hill]]); later in the episode Bill, exploiting a loophole that says he still has eligibility left because he failed to complete his senior year before joining the Army, returns to Arlen High and scores a touchdown to tie that record despite the protests of the injured player whose record Bill tied.\n\n==USA Basketball==\nSales was named to the team representing the USA at the  1994 [[William Jones Cup]] competition in [[Taipei, Taiwan]]. The USA team won all eight games, winning the gold medal, but not without close calls. In three games the teams had to come from behind to win. One preliminary game ended up as a single-point victory, and the gold medal game went to overtime before the USA team beat South Korea by a single point, 90\u201389. Sales averaged 2.5 points per game.<ref name=\"1994 Jones Cup\"/>\n\nSales competed with [[USA Basketball]] as a member of the 1995 [[United States women's national basketball team#William Jones Cup|Jones Cup Team]] that won the Bronze in [[Taipei]]. She averaged 7.8 points per game and was second on the team in steals, with ten.<ref name=\"1995 Jones Cup\"/>\n\nSales was invited to be a member of the Jones Cup team representing the USA in 1996. She helped the team to a 9\u20130 record, and the gold medal in the event. Sales averaged 4.8 points per game.<ref name=\"1996 Jones Cup\"/>\n\nSales represented the USA at the 1997 World University Games held in [[Marsala]], [[Sicily]], [[Italy]] in August 1997. The USA team won all six games, earning the gold medal at the event. Sales was the team's leading scorer, averaging 18.3 points per game. In the game against Cuba, Sales scored 32 points, which set a record for points scored in a gold medal game, and represents the third highest point total by an American recorded at the World University Games.<ref name=\"1997 WUG\"/>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===WNBA===\nIn 1998, Sales was assigned to the [[Orlando Miracle]] as part of the [[expansion draft]].<ref name=\"wnba.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/nykesha_sales/bio.html|title=Players|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> She remained with the franchise even when the Miracle relocated to [[Uncasville, Connecticut]] and was renamed the [[Connecticut Sun]] prior to the 2003 season. She helped lead the team to the [[WNBA Finals]] in 2004 and 2005.  Sales has been named to the  WNBA All-Star team six times. Until she missed 12 games in the 2006 season, Sales had started 248 consecutive regular season games, the second longest such streak in WNBA history.<ref name=\"Players\"/>\n\nDespite repeatedly making the annual all-star team since the beginning of her career, Sales was left off the announced All-Decade Team on June 13, 2006 as part of a celebration of the league's 10th Anniversary.  On March 11, 2008, Sales noted that she would not participate in the 2008 WNBA campaign due to nagging injuries.  Sales also noted that her sitting out was not an early retirement, but just a break.[http://www.wnba.com/sun/news/salestakeshiatus.html]\n\n===International===\n* 2005-2006: {{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[Gambrinus Brno]]<ref name=\"wnba.com\"/>\n* 2007: {{flagicon|Poland}} [[Lotos VBW Clima Gdynia|Lotos Gdynia]]\n* 2007-2008: {{flagicon|Lithuania}} [[TEO Vilnius]] and {{flagicon|Latvia}} [[SK C\u0113sis]]\n* 2008-2009: {{flagicon|Latvia}} [[SK C\u0113sis]] and {{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[ZVVZ USK Praha]]\n* 2010-2013      {{flagicon|Turkey}} [[Besiktas JK]] and {{flagicon|Turkey}} [[Be\u015fikta\u015f JK]]\n* 2013- : {{flagicon|Bosnia and Herzegovina}} [[ZKK Mladi Krajisnik]] and {{flagicon|Bosnia and Herzegovina }} [[ZKK Mladi Krajisnik]]\n\n== Sports Diplomacy ==\nMs. Sales has also been an active participant in the [[SportsUnited]] Sports Envoy program for the [[Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]. In this function, she has traveled to [[Cape Verde]], [[Haiti]], the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Uganda]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Venezuela]], where she worked with the likes of [[Becky Bonner]], [[Christopher Clunie]], [[Samuel Dalembert]], [[Alex English]], [[Willie Green|Willie Greens,]] [[Jason Maxiell]] and [[Tamika Williams|Tamika Raymond]] to conduct basketball clinics and events that directly or indirectly reached more than 2350 youth from underserved areas.

She was born and raised in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] as the youngest of eight siblings, and where she was a standout at Acadiana High School. She graduated from [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1996. She is currently an assistant coach at [[Eastern Illinois Univeristy]].\n\n==USA Basketball==\nShe competed with [[USA Basketball]] as a member of the 1995 [[United States women's national basketball team#William Jones Cup|Jones Cup Team]] that won the Bronze in [[Taipei]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.usab.com/womens/wjcup_1995.html|title=1995 WOMEN'S R. WILLIAM JONES CUP|accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nSam was also invited to be a member of the Jones Cup team representing the USA in 1996. She helped the team to a 9\u20130 record, and the gold medal in the event. Sales averaged 13 points per games, the highest scoring average on the team, and was named to the All-Tournament first team.<ref name=\"1996 Jones Cup\"/>\n\n==Professional==\n\n===ABL===\nAfter her college graduation, Sam played three years for the [[San Jose Lasers]] in the now-defunct [[American Basketball League 1996-98|American Basketball League]] (ABL), a professional women's league.\n\n===WNBA===\nShortly after the ABL ceased operations in 1999, Sam was selected by the [[Orlando Miracle]] in the [[WNBA Draft]] and became one of the Miracle's most productive players that year. Sam was waived by the Miracle just before the 2000 season began, but was signed as a [[free agent]] by the [[Miami Sol]].  She played three seasons (2000, 2001, and 2002) with the Sol until the team folded due to financial difficulties. After the Sol ceased operations, the 2003 Dispersal Draft was held, and the [[Minnesota Lynx]] selected Sam, and she played for the Lynx that season.\n\nDuring the annual [[WNBA Draft]] on April 15, 2004, Sam and Lynx teammate [[Janell Burse]] were traded to the [[Seattle Storm]] in exchange for [[Amanda Lassiter]] and a first-round draft pick.  The trade was engineered as part of the Lynx' plan to draft the highly touted (and local favorite) [[Lindsay Whalen]]. Unfortunately for the Lynx, the [[Connecticut Sun]] had already selected Whalen. Sam spent the 2004 season with the [[Seattle Storm]], as the team won the [[WNBA Finals]] by defeating, ironically, the [[Connecticut Sun]], two games to one. After the 2004 season ended, Sam became an unrestricted [[free agent]]. On February 14, 2005, Sam signed with the [[Charlotte Sting]]. She would be involved in yet another dispersal draft in [[2007 WNBA Draft#Dispersal Draft|2007]] after the demise of the Sting. This time, she was selected by the [[Indiana Fever]]. On May 7, 2008 Sheri signed with the [[Detroit Shock]]. Her 2008 season with the Detroit Shock was the last of her 10-year WNBA career.<ref>http://www.vucommodores.com/ot/2011-hof-sam.html</ref>\n\nDuring the 2007-08 WNBA off-season, she played for Ashdod in Israel.<ref>[http://www.wnba.com/news/overseas_0708.html Offseason 2007-08: Overseas Roster]</ref> She is currently playing for Panionios in Greece during the 2008-09 WNBA off-season.<ref>[http://www.wnba.com/news/overseas_0809.html Offseason 2008-09: Overseas Roster]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"1996 Jones Cup\">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=June 10, 2010|title=1996 Women's R.

Staley is a three-time Olympian and was elected to carry the [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] at the opening ceremony of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. After playing point guard for the [[University of Virginia]] under [[Debbie Ryan]], and winning the gold medal at the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympics]], she went to play professionally in the [[American Basketball League (1996\u201398)|American Basketball League]] and the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]. In 2011, Staley was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in WNBA history. She was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nWhile still a WNBA player, she started coaching the [[Temple University]] Owls women's basketball team in 2000. In six years at Temple, she led the program to six NCAA tournaments, three regular season conference championships, and four conference tournament titles.\n\nOn May 7, 2008, she was named the [[University of South Carolina]] women's head basketball coach. Over the following six seasons, she improved her program's record every year, up to winning the SEC in 2013-2014. In late 2014 her team achieved the program's first #1 ranking, making her only the second individual to both play on and coach a #1 ranked team.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===High school years===\nStaley was named the national high school player of the year during her final season at Murrell Dobbins Tech High School in Philadelphia.\n\n===College years===\nStaley attended the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. During her four seasons in college, she led her team to four [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournaments]], three [[Final Four]]s and one National Championship game. She was named the ACC female athlete of the year and the national player of the year in 1991 and 1992. Staley finished her college career with 2,135 points and holds the NCAA record for career steals with 454. She finished her career at Virginia as the school's all-time scoring leader and as the ACC's all-time leader in assists at 729, but those records have since been broken by former UVA stars [[Monica Wright]] and [[Sharnee Zoll]], respectively.  Her number 24 is retired at UVA.\n\nIn 1994-5, after graduation, Staley played professional basketball in [[France]] in [[Tarbes Gespe Bigorre|Tarbes]], [[Italy]], [[Brazil]], and [[Spain]] before joining the ABL and then the WNBA.\n\n===ABL===\nIn 1996, she joined the [[Philadelphia Rage|Richmond Rage]] of the [[American Basketball League (1996\u201398)|American Basketball League]] (ABL) and led the team to the ABL finals in 1997. The following season, the team moved to Staley's hometown of [[Philadelphia]].\n\n===WNBA===\nIn the [[1999 WNBA Draft]], Staley was selected with the ninth overall pick by the [[Charlotte Sting]]. In 2001, she led the Sting to the Championship game of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] playoffs.\n\nOn August 1, 2005, Staley was traded to the [[Houston Comets]]. Staley announced before the start of the WNBA season that she would be retiring after the Comets season was over. The Comets made the playoffs and faced the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] in the first round. The Monarchs swept the Comets and won the series 2\u20130, ending Staley's career. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA.<ref>http://www.wnba.com/allstar/2011/top15_072311.html</ref>\n\n===USA Basketball===\nStaley was named to the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team (now called the [[USA Women's U18 and U19 teams|U19 team]]). The team participated in the second Junior World Championship, held in [[Bilbao]], Spain in July 1989. The USA team lost their opening game to South Korea in overtime, then lost a two-point game to Australia. After winning their next game against Bulgaria, the USA team again fell in a close game, losing by three points to Czechoslovakia. After beating Zaire in their next game, the USA team played Spain, and fell three points short. Staley averaged 10.8 points per game and recorded 14 steals over the course of the event, both second highest on the team. The USA team finished in seventh place.<ref name=\"1989 U19\"/>\n\nStaley was named to the team representing the USA at the World University Games held during July 1991 in [[Sheffield]], England. While the USA team had won gold in 1983, they finished with the silver in 1985, in fifth place in 1987, and did not field a team in 1989. The team was coached by [[Tara VanDerveer]] of Stanford. After winning opening games easily, the USA faced China in the medal round.

She was on the Olympic team at the time which was attending the [[2000 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] in Philadelphia. O\u2019Brien talked her into visiting the campus, where she was guided to a conference room with a dozen people who were treating her visit as a job interview. When they asked her if she saw herself as a coach she replied \u201cno, not at all\u201d. She initially resisted offers to become the coach. O\u2019Brien changed his tactics and challenged her to identify some ways to turn the program around. She was still playing in the WNBA at the time and her friends told her it would be impossible to continue to play and coach. That challenge convinced her she should try so she accepted the position of head coach of Temple.at [[Temple University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/sec/2016/03/14/south-carolinas-dawn-staley-emerging-new-face-womens-basketball/81760334/|title=South Carolina's Dawn Staley emerging as new face of women's basketball|website=USA TODAY|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref> In her first season, 2000\u201301, Temple University advanced to the [[Women's National Invitation Tournament|WNIT]]. In 2001, 2002, and 2004, her teams won the [[Atlantic 10 Women's Basketball Tournament|Atlantic 10 tournament]] to qualify for the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]].\n\nIn 2004\u201305 season, Staley's Owls went 28\u20134 on the year, including a perfect 19\u20130 against Atlantic 10 opponents. However, they lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament to [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights women's basketball|Rutgers University]]. Staley reached the 100 win plateau in the A-10 Semifinals vs [[Xavier University]] that season, becoming the fastest coach in women's basketball to achieve that.\n\nOn May 7, 2008, it was confirmed by Temple University that Staley would leave Temple for the recently vacated coaching position at the [[University of South Carolina]]. She left Temple with the best overall record of 172\u201380, along with six NCAA appearances and four [[Atlantic 10 Conference|Atlantic 10]] titles.\n\nAt South Carolina she started rebuilding a program from scratch, while suffering through two losing seasons at the start of her tenure. Starting with only 10 wins during the 2008-2009 season, she led the program to ever better finishes in each subsequent season, leading to the program's first #1 Ranking and Final Four Appearance during the 2014-2015 season.\n\nUnder Staley the program captured two SEC regular season championships, one SEC tournament title, one Final Four, two sweet sixteen appearances, the 2nd ranked recruiting class in 2014, two SEC player of the year awards and three SEC freshman of the year awards. Staley herself was named twice SEC coach of the year and also the Basketball Times Coach of the Year in 2014.\n\n===Head coaching record===\n{{CBB Yearly Record Start | type=coach | conference=

Lisa Leslie, who had led the team in scoring in the 2004 Olympics, the 2002 World Championships, the 2000 Olympics, the 1998 World Championships, and the 1996 Olympics was no longer on the team. Sheryl Swoopes was available but hampered by injuries, with Staley transitioning from player to coach. Newcomers [[Sue Bird]], [[Candace Parker]] and [[Diana Taurasi]] picked up the slack, but it was a team in transition. As an additional challenge, some members of the squad were unable to join the team for practices due to [[WNBA]] commitments. The team started out strong, winning each of the six preliminary games, including the game against Russia. In the quarterfinals, the USA team beat Spain 90\u201356. The semifinal was a rematch against Russia, but this time the Russian team prevailed, 75\u201368. The USA faced Brazil in the bronze medal game, and won easily 99\u201359.<ref name=\"World 2006\"/>\n\nDuring the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympic Games]] in Beijing, China, Staley served as an assistant coach under Team USA head coach [[Anne Donovan]] and helped the Americans win their fourth straight gold medal in women's basketball and sixth in their past seven Olympic appearances.\n\nShe is also an assistant coach for the upcoming [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Summer Olympic Games]] in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAfter coaching Team USA to a Gold medal at the 2007 Pan Am games, she served as head coach to the U17 Team in 2014 and the U19 Team in 2015, winning gold medals at the U18 Americas Championship and the U19 FIBA World Championship. The USA basketball organization awarded her the code national coach of the year award as a result of the U 19 gold-medal.

While there, She became the first [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I women\u2019s player to score more than 1,000 points in a season, scoring 1,062 in her senior year.<ref name=\"WBB D1 Records\"/> That year, she won the [[Wade Trophy]],<ref name=\"Wade Trophy\"/> which honors the best women's basketball player in the college ranks, as well as the [[Broderick Cup]], which honors the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year. She competed with [[USA Basketball]] as a member of the 2000  [[United States women's national basketball team#William Jones Cup|Jones Cup Team]] that won the gold in [[Taipei]].<ref name=\"JonesCup\"/>\n\nDuring her four collegiate years, Stiles scored 3,393 points, highest for Division I women's basketball. Another Kansan, Wichitan Lynette Woodard, scored 3,649 points at the University of Kansas before their women's basketball program was Division I. On March 10, 2000, she scored 56 points against Evansville, which stands as the fourth highest number of points in a single Division I game.<ref name=\"WBB D1 Records\"/>\n\n==USA Basketball==\nStiles was named to the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team (now called the [[USA Women's U18 and U19 teams|U18 team]]). The team participated in the third Junior World Championship, held in [[Chetumal, Mexico]] in late August and early September of 1996. The USA team won their early games easily, but lost by four points to the team from Brazil, ending up with the silver medal for the event.<ref name=\"1996 U18\"/>\n\nStiles was named to the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team when it was invited to the 1997 FIBA Junior World Championship (now called U19) held in [[Natal, Brazil]]. After beating Japan, the next game was against Australia, the defending champion. The USA team pulled out to a 13-point lead in the second half, but gave up the lead and lost the game 80\u201374. The USA rebounded with a close 92\u201388 victory over Cuba, helped by 23 points each from [[Maylana Martin]] and [[Lynn Pride]]. The USA then went on to beat previously unbeaten Russia. After winning the next two games, the USA faced Australia in the gold medal game. The USA team has a three-point lead late, but the Aussies hit a three-pointer with three seconds left in regulation to force overtime. Although the Aussies scored first, the USA team came back, then pulled into the lead and held on to win 78\u201374 to earn the gold, and the first medal for a USA team at a Junior World Championship. Stiles averaged 1.0 point per game.<ref name=\"1997 U19\"/>\n\nStiles was named to the team representing the USA in 2000 at the [[William Jones Cup]] competition in [[Taipei, Taiwan]]. The USA team started strong with a 32-point win over the host team, the Republic of China National Team. They then beat South Korea easily and faced Japan in the third game. Japan started out strongly, and had an 18-point lead in the first half. The USA then out scored Japan 23\u20133 to take a small lead at the half. The USA built a ten-point lead, but Japan cut it back to three with under a minute to go. [[Kelly Schumacher]] grabbed an offensive rebound and scored to bring the lead back to five points and the team held on for the win. The USA team beat Japan 83\u201380. The final game was against Malaysia, but it wasn't close, with the USA winning 79\u201324, to secure a 4\u20130 record for the competition and the gold medal. Stiles averaged 6.8 points per game.<ref name=\"2000 JONES CUP\"/>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nStiles was the 2001 winner of the Honda award for basketball<ref name=\"Past Winners - basketball\"/> and the overall [[Honda-Broderick Cup]] winner for all sports.<ref name=\"Honda Cup past winners\"/>\n\nShe was one of 11 honorees inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in the Class of 2007.  She was also inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame (Class of 2016) on June 11, 2016.\n\n==Professional==\nHer pro career started promisingly. In the [[2001 WNBA Draft]], she was selected fourth overall by the [[Portland Fire]], and was later voted the [[WNBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] on August 16, 2001. But since that high point, Stiles has suffered numerous injuries, including 13 surgeries, which greatly hampered her WNBA career.\n\nAfter the Fire folded in 2002, Stiles was selected 14th by the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], but did not play that season, spending rehabilitation time for her injuries. She left the WNBA after that season.\n\nIn 2004, Stiles signed with the Lubbock Hawks (in [[Lubbock, Texas]]) of the [[National Women's Basketball League]] (NWBL). This also proved unsuccessful, but Stiles has embraced a new sport in which she is apparently having more success: [[Cycle sport|competitive cycling]].<ref name=\"Cycling\"/>\n\nIn 2006, Stiles played briefly for the [[Canberra Capitals]] in the [[Women's National Basketball League]] in [[Australia]] before retiring due to injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jstilesonline.com/about/biography-jackie-stiles|title=Biography &#8211; Jackie Stiles |accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref>\n\nStiles' younger sister, Roxanne, led Claflin High School to back-to-back Class 1A state championships in Kansas in 2005 and 2006, has followed in her sister's footsteps by playing basketball at [[Missouri State University|Missouri State]].\n\n==Coaching==\n\nIn August, 2012, she accepted a women's basketball assistant coach position with [[Loyola Marymount University]] in Los Angeles, California. On April 18, 2013, it was announced that Ms. Stiles would be returning to her alma mater as assistant coach for the [[Missouri State Bears|Lady Bears]] women's basketball team.<ref>http://ozarksfirst.com/fulltext?nxd_id=795062</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of NCAA Division I women's basketball players with 3000 points]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"WBCA Box Scores\">{{cite web|last= |first= |date= |title=WBCA High School All-America Game Box Scores |url=http://www.wbca.org/pages/AWARDS_high_school_all-america_game_box_scores |work= |publisher=Women's Basketball Coaches Association |accessdate=29 Jun 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140715064856/http://www.wbca.org/pages/AWARDS_high_school_all-america_game_box_scores |archivedate=July 15, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WBCA HS MVP\">{{cite web|last= |first= |date= |title=WBCA High School All-America Game Team MVP's |url=http://www.wbca.org/pages/AWARDS_high_school_all-america_game_past_mvps |work= |publisher=Women's Basketball Coaches Association |accessdate=29 Jun 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140715083757/http://www.wbca.org/pages/AWARDS_high_school_all-america_game_past_mvps |archivedate=July 15, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WBB D1 Records\">{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/w_basketball_RB/2010/d1wbb.pdf|title=WBB Division 1 Records|publisher=NCAA|pages=2\u20133|accessdate=25 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Wade Trophy\">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The Wade Trophy|url=http://www.wbca.org/pages/AWARDS_wade-trophy|work=|publisher=Women's Basketball Coaches Association|accessdate=30 Jun 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"JonesCup\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.usab.com/womens/wjcup_2000.html|title=2000 WOMEN'S R.

At times in her career, she had to play [[Forward (basketball)|forward]] because there were shorter players in the starting five on her team. However, she mainly plays [[Guard (basketball)|guard]].\n\nIn her WNBA debut, Taurasi netted 26 points and led the Mercury to an 84\u201376 victory over the [[Seattle Storm]]. For the season, the rookie averaged 17.0 points, 4.4 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game. Although the Mercury did not qualify for the playoffs, Taurasi was named to the Western Conference All Star team and won the [[WNBA Rookie of the Year Award]].\n\nIn 2005, Taurasi averaged 16.0 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game while battling an ankle injury. She was an All Star for the second straight year, but the Mercury faded down the stretch and again missed the playoffs.\n\nFormer [[NBA]] coach [[Paul Westhead]] became the Mercury's head coach prior to the 2006 season and brought his up-tempo style to Phoenix. Their roster was further bolstered by the addition of rookie [[Cappie Pondexter]], the #2 overall selection in the [[2006 WNBA Draft]].\n\n[[File:Diana Taurasi.jpg|thumb|120px|left|thumb|Taurasi at the White House]]\n\nTaurasi flourished under Westhead's system, leading the league in scoring and earning a third straight trip to the All Star Game. She broke [[Katie Smith|Katie Smith's]] league records for points in a season (741 during the 2006 season) and is tied with [[Lauren Jackson]] for most points in a game (47 vs. [[Houston Comets|Houston]] on August 10). In 2006, Taurasi averaged a record 25.3 points, 4.1 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game. The Mercury finished 18\u201316, but after losing a tie-breaker with Houston and Seattle, missed the playoffs.\n\nIn 2007, Taurasi finally reached the WNBA playoffs. In the first round, the Mercury eliminated the [[Seattle Storm]] two games to none. Next, they swept the [[San Antonio Silver Stars]] in a hard fought two game series. Taurasi got to her first [[WNBA Finals]], but had to face the defending champion [[Detroit Shock]]. Taurasi and Pondexter led the Mercury to their first WNBA title. With this victory Taurasi became the seventh player ever to win an NCAA title, a WNBA title, and an Olympic gold medal. The others to achieve this are [[Ruth Riley]], [[Sheryl Swoopes]], [[Cynthia Cooper-Dyke]],  and fellow Huskies [[Swin Cash]], [[Kara Wolters]], [[Sue Bird]], and after the London 2012 Games, [[Maya Moore]] and [[Tamika Catchings]].\n\nTaurasi was a member of the USA women's 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 gold medal Olympic Basketball Teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=woly_2004|title=Games of the XXVIIIth Olympiad&nbsp;\u2013 2004|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=woly_2008|title=Games of the XXVIIIth Olympiad&nbsp;\u2013 2008|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2009 season, Taurasi was named the WNBA MVP and later led the Phoenix Mercury to its second WNBA championship in three years by beating the Indiana Fever, three games to two, as Taurasi was named the WNBA Finals MVP.

He ended up buying that team, but later decided to buy the Spartak Moscow Region team, and turn it into a top team.

In September 2006, she led the Australian Opals to a gold medal at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship for Women|World Championships]], winning tournament MVP honours ahead of teammate [[Lauren Jackson]].\n\n==Personal==\nPenny was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to [[England|English]] parents Michael Taylor and Denna Noble. She has a younger brother named Phillip and an older sister named Heather.  As both her parents are tall, they thought Penny would inherit their height and put her in the [[Belgrave South, Victoria|Belgrave South]] Red Devils basketball club at the age of 4.

The Mercury went on to win the WNBA Championship that year, beating the Indiana Fever 3 games to 2, with Taylor making 2 clutch free throws down the stretch to help clinch the decisive game 94\u201386.\n\nIn 2012, Taylor suffered an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]] of her left knee playing in Turkey during the WNBA offseason, and was forced to sit out of the Mercury's season.

Many people consider the Melbourne native to be one of Australia's greatest basketball players of all time.\n\n== WNBL career ==\nTimms played for four clubs in her WNBL career; Bulleen, Nunawading, Perth and Sydney. In 2005, Timms was honoured by the WNBL with the creation of the Michele Timms Cup. The cup is presented to the winner of the Bulleen Bombers-Dandenong Rangers derbies.\n\n== WNBA career ==\nAt the onset of the WNBA in 1997, she went to the Phoenix Mercury, for whom she played in the [[WNBA Finals|Finals]] in 1998, losing to the [[Houston Comets]]. Timms came within inches of giving the Mercury their first title that year; with the Mercury up 1-0 and needing only one more win for the championship, and Game Two tied at 66 with three seconds to go, Timms took a three-point shot that bounced off the rim's back. Ultimately, the Comets won that game 74-69 in overtime, and then the championship in Game Three. In 2001, Timms announced her retirement and almost immediately joined the Mercury's [[television]] broadcasting crew, a job which she held only for that season. She averaged 4.6 points and 4.0 [[assist (basketball)|assist]]s per game with the Mercury; her highest scoring average in one season being 12.1 points per game in 1997. On 7 August 2002, her number \"7\" jersey became the first to be retired by the Phoenix Mercury, and only the 2nd jersey ever retired by the WNBA. Upon her retirement, she was the Mercury's career leader in assists.\n\nIn February 2005, the Phoenix Mercury announced that she had been signed as an assistant coach under fellow Australian and Mercury head coach [[Carrie Graf]].\n\nTimms played a very influential role in opening the flood gate for many of the future international women's players, especially Australian women basketball stars.\n\n== International career ==\nTimms began her professional basketball career in 1984 in Australia. In 1989, she became the first Australian (male or female) to play professional basketball internationally when she went to [[Germany]] to play with the Lotus M\u00fcnchen team. While there, she got a chance to play alongside [[Marlies Askamp]], who would later also play with her on the Mercury. While there, she was named the ''Women's International Player of The Year'' in 1994 and 1996. She was selected to the [[Women's National Basketball League|WNBL]] All team 7 times (1988\u201392, 1994, 1996)\n\nAlso in 1996, at her second [[Summer Olympics]], she helped the Australian national women's basketball team earn their first [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medal, a bronze at the [[Atlanta]] competition. Four years later Timms was on the squad that captured the silver medal in front of their own crowd.\n\n== Coaching career ==\nShe worked as the basketball development officer for the [[South Dragons]] in the Australian [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]]. During her time with the Dragons, she impressed many of the club's staff and players with her sound knowledge of the game and excellent coaching skills. She left the club on 9 January 2008 and during the middle of the Dragons' season, to fulfill her career ambitions by moving to the [[United States]].<ref>[http://southdragons.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=73792 Timms signs off on Dragons], southdragons.com.au, 9 January 2008</ref>\n\nShe was an assistant coach with [[China women's national basketball team]], reuniting her with her former Opals coach [[Tom Maher]].<ref>Bernard, G., [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23190978-10914,00.html China calls for Timms], ''Herald Sun'', 10 February 2008</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Timms was appointed as an assistant coach of the Jayco Australian Opals, the [[Australia women's national basketball team]].  She was also appointed an assistant coach of the [[Melbourne Boomers|Global Metals Bulleen Boomers]] in the [[Women's National Basketball League]].\n\n== Honours ==\nTimms was named the ''Women's International Player of The Year'' in 1994 and 1996. She received an [[Australian Sports Medal]] in 2000 and was inducted into the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite

a game (29), most points in a season (675), and most career points (1,546).<ref>Staff.

Accessed March 1, 2011. \"Walker, who is from Mount Holly, Burlington County, starred at Rancocas Valley High School in the early 1990s and then at Virginia.\"</ref>\n\nIn her senior year, she was named to the 1995 [[All-America]]n first team by ''[[Street & Smith]]'s'' [[New Jersey]] High School \"Female Athlete of the Year\", and ''[[Parade Magazine]]'' [[All-America]] Second Team as a [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]] senior.\n\n==University of Virginia==\nWalker attended the [[University of Virginia]] and played on the women's basketball team (known as ''The Cavaliers'') from 1995 to 1999.\n\nBy the time she graduated, she became Virginia's all-time leader in field goal percentage, as well as 330 career blocked shots which at the time was ranked 12th in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] record books. She averaged 13.0 points per game and 6.9 rebounds per game during her career.\n\nHer 1,583 points ranks her ninth in school history.\n\nShe was named the \"Cavalier of the Year\", and was an Honorable Mention All-America selection in her senior year (1998-99 season) after leading the team in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots.\n\nShe is also a member of the [[Zeta Phi Beta]] [[Sorority]].\n\n==USA Basketball==\nWalker was selected to play with the USA team at the [[USA Women's Pan American Team|1999 Pan American Games]].

Walker averaged 1.6 points per game.<ref name=\"1999 Pan Am\"/>\n\n==WNBA career==\nDespite her impressive career in college, Walker was not selected by any of the WNBA teams during the [[1999 WNBA Draft]], mainly due to the influx of former players from the just-disbanded [[American Basketball League 1996-98|American Basketball League]] (ABL), a rival professional women's league. Several of the ABL's star players were selected in that year's draft.\n\nHowever, prior to the start of the [[1999 WNBA season]], Walker was assigned to the [[Minnesota Lynx]] for its pre-season training camp, but was cut from the team final roster shortly afterwards. Walker spent that summer playing overseas on a professional women's league team in [[Italy]].\n\nIn 2000, she signed a [[free agent]] contract with the [[Portland Fire]], and played with them for three seasons until the team was disbanded due to financial difficulties.\n\nOn April 24, 2003, the WNBA held a [[Dispersal draft]], where various former players from the newly-defunct [[Portland Fire]] and [[Miami Sol]] teams were chosen by the existing WNBA teams. Walker was selected by the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] as the fifth overall pick in the 2003 WNBA Dispersal Draft.\n\nWalker played the 2003-08 seasons with the Monarchs, and even helped the team win the [[2005 WNBA Finals]] by defeating the [[Connecticut Sun]], three games to one.\n\nWhen the Monarchs folded prior to the [[2010 WNBA season]], Walker was selected by the [[Connecticut Sun]] in a dispersal draft.\n\n==Personal==\n\n*Two months after the Monarchs won the title she announced her [[pregnancy]].\n*In April 2006, after going through an intense four days of [[childbirth|labor]], Walker gave a [[Caesarean section]] birth to her first child, a daughter named Zachara.  She went on [[maternity leave]] and missed the first 11 games of the 2006 WNBA season, before returning to the Monarchs' player roster.\n*Earned her degree from Virginia in Government.\n*After playing days are over wants to be an attorney in mergers & acquisitions.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"1999 Pan Am\">{{cite web|title=Thirteenth Pan American Games -- 1999|date=June 10,

[[North Carolina State]]'s [[Kay Yow]] served as head coach. The team opened up with a 72\u201353 of Yugoslavia, and followed that with a 21-point win over Brazil 91\u201370. The third game was against Czechoslovakia and would be much closer, ending in a 78\u201370 victory. The USA faced Bulgaria in the semi-final match up, and again won, this time 67\u201358. This set up the final against the Soviet Union, led by 7-foot-2 Ivilana Semenova, considered the most dominant player in the world. The Soviet team, had a 152\u20132 record in major international competition over the prior three decades, including an 84\u201382 win over the USA in the 1983 World Championships.

The USA team started by scoring the first eight points, and raced to a 45\u201323 lead, although the Soviets fought back and reduced the halftime margin to 13. The USA went on a 15\u20141 run in the second half to out the game away, and ended up winning the gold medal with a score of 108\u201388.<ref name=\"1986 WC\"/>\n\nWeatherspoon was selected to be a member of the team representing the USA at the 1987 World University Games held in [[Zagreb, Yugoslavia]].

professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Minnesota Lynx]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA), and for AG\u00dc Spor of [[Eurobasket]]. She began her pro career as a [[point guard]] for the [[Connecticut Sun]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lindsay Whalen Galatasaray'da|url=http://www.galatasaray.org/basketbol/bayan/haber/14021.php|publisher=Galatasaray MP|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> Whalen has won World and Olympic titles with the [[United States women's national basketball team]], as well as three WNBA titles with the Lynx.\n\n==High school career==\nAt Hutchinson High School in [[Hutchinson, Minnesota]], Whalen was a four-time All-Minnesota  Conference pick, and led her team to three consecutive conference basketball championships. She was also a four-time honorable mention All-State selection. She averaged 22.8 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists as a junior.\n\nWhalen won a state title and placed 13th nationally with her club team, the Minnesota Jaguars. She was also an All-Conference selection in tennis and track.\n\n==College career==\nThe [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball|University of Minnesota women's basketball program]] rose to national prominence during Whalen's college career. The average attendance at women's basketball games grew from 1,087 during her freshman season to 9,866 her senior year. She became Minnesota's all-time leading scorer on January 25, 2004 against Michigan State, surpassing 1994 Wade Trophy Winner Carol Ann Shudlick. Whalen finished her career with 2,285 points, fifth best in [[Big Ten Conference]] history.\n\nWhalen holds Minnesota career records in points, scoring average, games in double figures, free throws made and free throw percentage. Whalen is also among the top ten in field goals made, field goal attempts, field goal percentage, three-pointers made, three-pointers attempted, three-point field goal percentage, free throws attempted, assists and steals. Whalen shares Minnesota's single-game record for free throw percentage (14\u201314 vs. Creighton on 12/4/03) and is the only four-time team MVP in school history.\n\nShe was a two-time [[Wade Trophy]] Finalist (2003, 2004) and a two-time [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith Award]] Finalist (2003, 2004). As a senior, Whalen was a Kodak All-American First Team, made the USBWA All-American Second Team, USBWA All-American Second Team and AP All-American Second Team. She was the first Golden Gopher to earn All-American honors in three different seasons and led Minnesota to its first-ever Final Four appearance in 2004, one of three straight NCAA Tournament appearances for Minnesota. The program had been to the tournament just once before her arrival.\n\nIn the postseason, Whalen was named NCAA Mideast Region MVP for the 2004 NCAA tournament and was a unanimous selection for All-Big Ten First Team in 2004, 2003 and 2002. She was a three-time Academic All-Big Ten (2004, 2003, 2002), won the 2004 and 2002 Fast Break Club Award. As a junior, she was a Kodak All-American First Team, USBWA All-American First Team and an AP All-American Second Team.\n\nWhalen's jersey number 13 was retired by the University of Minnesota during a ceremony in January 2005 at [[Williams Arena]].\n\n===College statistics===\nSource<ref name=\"NCAA Player stats\"/>\n{{NBA player statistics legend}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n  !Year\n  !Team\n  !GP\n  !Points\n  !FG%\n  !3P%\n  !FT%\n  !RPG\n  !APG\n  !SPG\n  !BPG\n  !PPG\n \n |-\n  |2000-01\n  |[[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball|Minnesota]]\n  |25\n  |425\n  |47.6\n  |30.2\n  |73.5\n  |4.0\n  |3.3\n  |1.7\n  |0.1\n  |17.0\n \n |-\n  |2001-02\n  |Minnesota\n  |30\n  |667\n  |56.1\n  |34.9\n  |77.0\n  |5.5\n  |5.3\n  |2.7\n  |0.2\n  |22.2\n \n |-\n  |2002-03\n  |Minnesota\n  |31\n  |639\n  |54.6\n  |32.4\n  |84.7\n  |5.0\n  |6.2\n  |1.9\n  |0.0\n  |20.6\n \n |-\n  |2003-04\n  |Minnesota\n  |27\n  |554\n  |51.4\n  |40.0\n  |83.2\n  |5.1\n  |5.4\n  |1.9\n  | -\n  |20.5\n \n |-\n  |Career\n  |Minnesota\n  |113\n  |2285\n  |52.8\n  |34.9\n  |79.8\n  |4.9\n  |5.1\n  |2.1\n  |0.1\n  |20.2\n |}\n\n==WNBA career==\n[[File:Lindsay Whalen of the Minnesota Lynx.jpg|175 px|left|thumb|Whalen in 2010]]\nWhalen was selected the first round of the 2004 [[WNBA Draft]] (4th overall) by the [[Connecticut Sun]]. Until 2005 when Minnesota teammate [[Janel McCarville]] was selected at number 1, she was the highest drafted WNBA player ever from the [[Big Ten Conference]]. The [[Minnesota Lynx]] made an unsuccessful pre-draft trade, sending [[Sheri Sam]] and [[Janell Burse]] to the [[Seattle Storm]] for [[Amanda Lassiter]] and the 6th pick in the draft in an attempt to get hometown hero Whalen. Connecticut picked Whalen before Minnesota could, and the Storm had two more pieces to their eventual championship team.\n\nIn her rookie season, she was selected to play in the historic [[WNBA All-Star Game|WNBA vs. USA Basketball game]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]]. She led the Sun to the [[WNBA Finals]] in her first and second seasons, playing while injured in the 2005 Finals.\n \nIn the 2008 season, Whalen led a young team to second place in the Eastern Conference. She was the MVP runner-up to Candace Parker. She was selected to the First Team All-WNBA for the first time in her career. In the playoffs, the Sun could not hold off the New York Liberty as they fell 2\u20131. Whalen led the league in assists with 5.4 per game.\n\nOn January 12, 2010, Whalen was traded to the [[Minnesota Lynx]] in a deal that also involved [[Renee Montgomery]]. She signed a multi-year contract extension with the Minnesota Lynx  prior to the team's Aug. 12, 2010 matchup with the Los Angeles Sparks. Terms of the deal were not announced, per team policy.<ref>http://www.sportspagemagazine.com/content/bb/wp-bb/art-wp-bb/with-lynx-on-verge-of-playoffs-whalen-signs-extens.shtml?41400</ref>\n\nIn [[2011 Minnesota Lynx season|2011]], Whalen led the Lynx to its first [[2011 WNBA Finals|WNBA Championship]].<ref>http://thegrio.com/2011/10/11/lynx-feted-with-wnba-championship-parade/</ref> The Lynx finished the regular season 27\u20137, good for the second best record in franchise history and best in the league. Playing alongside a healthy [[Seimone Augustus]] and rookie sensation [[Maya Moore]], Whalen [[WNBA Peak Performers|led the WNBA in assists]] with 5.9 per game.<ref>[http://www.wnba.com/lynx/news/pressrelease_Whalen_Captures_WNBA_Peak_Performer_Honor_2011_09_13.html Whalen Captures WNBA Peak Performer Honor]</ref> Whalen finished fifth in MVP voting<ref>[http://www.slamonline.com/online/media/slam-tv/2011/08/lindsay-whalen-for-mvp/ Lindsay Whalen for MVP?]</ref> and was named [[All-WNBA Team|First Team All-WNBA]] for the second time in her career. In [[2012 Minnesota Lynx season|2012]], Whalen led the league in assists for the third time in her career, and led the Lynx back to the finals, where they lost to the [[Indiana Fever]].\n\nIn 2013, the Minnesota Lynx acquired the rights to Janel McCarville via a three-team trade, and she and Whalen were reunited as teammates. On September 7, 2013, Whalen became only the second player in WNBA history to record 4,000 points, 1,500 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in her career, joining [[Becky Hammon]].<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/sports/lynx/222846031.html Chart: Whalen's career milestone]</ref> She also became the 20th player in league history to reach 4,000 points.\n\nWhalen was included in 2016 on the [[WNBA Top 20@20]], the best players in the WNBA's twenty years of activity. <ref>[http://www.gophersports.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/062116aaa.html]</ref>\n\n==USA Basketball==\nWhalen was invited to the USA Basketball Women's National Team training camp in the fall of 2009.<ref name=\"National Team\">{{cite web|url=http://usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=09_wnt_fall_invitees_add_rm|title=USA Basketball Women's National Team To Tip-Off Training Tomorrow In D.C.|publisher=USA Basketball|accessdate=October 1, 2009}}</ref> The team selected to play for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics is usually chosen from these participants.<ref name=\"National Team\" /><ref name=\"National Team Pool\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/olybb/news/story?id=4962145|title=Charles, Moore lead U.S. pool additions|date=March 3, 2010|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> Whalen was selected to be a member of the National team representing the USA at the World Championships held in September and October 2010. The team was coached by [[Geno Auriemma]]. Because many team members were still playing in the [[WNBA]] until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for [[Ostrava]] and [[Karlovy Vary]], Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win its first games against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring  honors, with [[Swin Cash]], [[Angel McCoughtry]], [[Maya Moore]], [[Diana Taurasi]], Whalen, and [[Sylvia Fowles]] all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia \u2014 the USA jumped out to a 24-point lead and the USA prevailed 83\u201375. The USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The USA team had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA went on to win the championship and gold medal. Whalen averaged 5.9 points per game.<ref name=\"2010 WC\"/>\n\nWhalen was named by the USA Basketball Women's National Team Player Selection Committee to compete for the USA at the 2012 Olympics in London.<ref name=\"Olympic Roster finalists\"/> Whalen earned praise for her performance at the Olympics, especially for a critical stretch of play against [[Australia national women's basketball

She played with the [[New York Liberty]] from 1997 to 2002. She currently serves as a collegiate basketball coach.\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Center Moriches, New York]], Wicks played for [[Rutgers University]] from 1984 to 1988. While at Rutgers, she was named a Kodak All-American in 1986, 1987 and 1988, and in 1988 she won the Naismith, U.S. Basketball Writers Association, Women\u2019s Basketball News Service and Street & Smith\u2019s National Player of the Year awards. She was Player of the Year in the Atlantic 10 Conference in 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning the Atlantic 10 Tournament MVP award in 1986 and 1988, and sharing it in 1987. She also was named to All-Regional Teams in the NCAA tournament in 1986 and 1987. She holds the Rutgers records for points scored (2,655), rebounds (1,357), scoring average (21.2 ppg), rebounding average (10.9 rpg), field goals made (1,091) and attempted (2,099), free throws made (473) and attempted (641), and blocked shots (293). The scoring and rebounding totals are records for a male or female player at Rutgers.\n\nShe was a [[Gold Medal|gold medalist]] in the 1987 [[Pan-American Games]].<ref name=\"1987 Pan Am\"/>\n\nFollowing her college career, she played professionally in Italy, Japan, Spain and Israel before the WNBA was founded. In 1997, she was signed for the inaugural WNBA season by the New York Liberty, to fill the role of back-up center. The Liberty played at the [[WNBA Finals|WNBA championship]] game, losing to the [[Houston Comets]], 65 to 51.\n\n==WNBA career==\nWicks spent more than 15 years playing professionally overseas and played in the [[WNBA]] for the [[New York Liberty]] for six years (1997 - 2002).<ref name=\"playerfile\">{{cite web | url=http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/sue_wicks/ | title=Sue Wicks Player Info | accessdate=June 1, 2014 | publisher=WNBA | website=wnba.com}}</ref> Wicks mostly came off the bench for the Liberty but did start 45 of 182 regular season games, including 30 starts (out of 32 games played) in 1999. Wicks starting in 1999 was due in part to her defensive skills. She developed into a fan favorite and was voted by the fans as a starter in the [[2000 WNBA All-Star Game|2000 WNBA all-star game]]. In 2000, she received the WNBA's top award for sportsmanship, the [[Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award]]. In 1999 and in 2000, Wicks and the Liberty reached the [[WNBA Finals]], only to be beaten by Houston again both times. In 2002, Wicks and the Liberty returned to the Finals again, but this time, they lost to [[Lisa Leslie]] and the [[Los Angeles Sparks]].\n\nIn 182 WNBA games played, Wicks scored 823 points, for a total of 4.5 points per game, had 182 assists for one assist per game, recovered 788 rebounds, for a total of 4.3 per game, and had 158 blocks, for a total of 0.90 blocks per game.

In 2004, she completed her bachelor's degree at Rutgers and was hired as the Coordinator of Operations for the Rutgers women's basketball team.
