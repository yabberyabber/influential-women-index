She acquired a degree in [[industrial engineering]] in 1974 and started programming text-based [[video game]]s as a hobby. In 1978, Bunten sold a real-time auction game for the [[Apple II]] titled ''[[Wheeler Dealers (game)|Wheeler Dealers]]'' to a [[Canada|Canadian]] software company, [[Speakeasy Software]]. This early multiplayer game required a custom controller, raising its price to [[United States dollar|USD]]$35 in an era of $15 games sold in plastic bags. It sold only 50 copies.<ref name=\"Halcyon Days\">[http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/BERRY.HTM Interview with Berry] from [[Halcyon Days (book)|''Halcyon Days'']]</ref>\n\nAfter three titles for [[Strategic Simulations Inc.|SSI]], Bunten, who by then had founded a software company called [[Ozark Softscape]], caught the attention of [[Electronic Arts]] founder [[Trip Hawkins]]. ''[[M.U.L.E.]]'' was Bunten's first game for EA, originally published for the [[Atari 8-bit family]] because the Atari 800 had four controller ports.  Bunten later ported it to the [[Commodore 64]]. While its sales &mdash; 30,000 units &mdash; were not high, the game developed a cult following and was widely [[Copyright infringement of software|pirated]]. The game setting was inspired by the novel ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nBunten wanted to follow up ''M.U.L.E.'' with a game that would have been similar to the later game ''[[Civilization video game|Civilization]]'', but after fellow Ozark Softscape partners balked at the idea, Bunten followed with ''[[The Seven Cities of Gold (game)|The Seven Cities of Gold]]'', which proved popular because of its simplicity. By the time the continent data were stored in memory, there was little memory left for fancy graphics or complex gameplay. The game only had five resources. It was a hit, selling more than 150,000 copies.\n\nThe follow-up game, ''[[Heart of Africa]]'', appeared in 1985  and was followed by ''[[Robot Rascals]]'', a combination computer/card game that had no single-player mode and sold only 9,000 copies, and 1988's ''[[Modem Wars]]'', one of the early games played by two players over a dialup [[modem]].\n\nBunten departed EA for [[MicroProse]], and was reportedly given a choice between doing a computer version of the [[Avalon Hill]] [[board game]] ''[[Civilization (1980 board game)|Civilization]]'' or a version of ''[[Axis and Allies]]''. There are claims that [[Sid Meier]] talked Bunten into doing ''Axis and Allies'' (which became 1990's ''[[Command HQ]]'', a modem/network [[grand strategy wargame]]), while Meier did ''Civilization'', which went on to become one of the best-selling video games of all time. Bunten's second and last game for MicroProse was 1992's ''[[Global Conquest]]'', a 4-player network/modem war game. It was the first 4-player network game from a major publisher. Bunten was a strong advocate of multi-player online games, observing that \"No one ever said on their deathbed, 'Gee, I wish I had spent more time alone with my computer.'\"<ref name=\"anticlock-why\">{{Wayback |date=20110725030551 |url=http://www.anticlockwise.com/dani/personal/biz/index.html |title=\"Why I Design Multi-Player, Online Games\"}} by Danielle Bunten Berry.

Bunten underwent [[sex reassignment surgery]] in November 1992 and afterwards kept a lower profile in the games industry.  Bunten later regretted having surgery, finding that for her, the drawbacks of surgical transition outweighed the benefits, and wishing she had considered alternative approaches.<ref name=\"anticlock\">{{Wayback |date=20110725030149 |url=http://www.anticlockwise.com/dani/personal/changes/dont.htm |title=\"Special Note to Those Thinking About a Sex Change\"}} by Danielle Bunten Berry from Anticlockwise.com</ref> She joked that the surgery was to improve the [[women and video games|video game industry's male/female ratio]] and aesthetics,<ref name=\"cgw199308\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=109 | title=Part II of CGW's Computer Game Developers Conference Coverage | work=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1993 | accessdate=12 July 2014 | pages=38}}</ref> but advised others considering a sex change not to proceed unless there was no alternative, and warned them of the cost, saying \"Being my 'real self' could have included having a penis and including more femininity in whatever forms made sense.

I just wish I would have tried more options before I jumped off the precipice.\"<ref name=\"anticlock\"/>\n\nA port of ''M.U.L.E.'' to the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] was cancelled after Bunten refused to put guns and bombs in the game, feeling it would alter the game too much from its original concept.<ref name=\"gama\">[http://www.gamasutra.com/features/game_design/19980717/danielle_berry.htm \"In Memoriam: Danielle Berry\"] by Ernest Adams from Gamasutra.com</ref>  In 1997, Bunten shifted focus to multiplayer games over the [[Internet]] with ''Warsport'', a remake of ''Modem Wars'' that debuted on the [[MPlayer.com]] game network.\n\nLess than a year after the release of ''Warsport'', Bunten was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] (presumably related to years of heavy smoking).<ref name=\"salon\">[http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/03/18/bunten/ \"The tragic genius of M.U.L.E.\"] from [[Salon.com]]</ref> She died on July 3, 1998.

While attending the [[Symposium on Operating Systems Principles]] (SOSP), she was struck by how few women were present at the conference. She and six or seven other women met in the ladies' room and talked about how few women there were in computing. A dozen of the women at the conference made plans to eat lunch together, and that is where the idea for Systers was formed.<ref name=\"biogvid\">{{cite web|title=Anita Borg Celebration: Changing the World for Women and Technology|url=http://www.youtube.com/abiwt#p/c/71607DB3B12823E9/2/resEXQgcaJo|work=Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 22, 2011|date=June 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSysters was established to provide a private space for its members to seek input and share advice based on their common experiences. Systers membership was limited to women with highly technical training and discussions were strictly confined to technical issues. Borg oversaw Systers until 2000.<ref name=\"NYT\" /> Systers occasionally tackled issues that were not highly technical but pertained to its members. In 1992, when [[Mattel]] Inc. began selling a [[Barbie]] doll that said ''math class is tough,'' the voices of protest that started with the Systers list played a role in getting Mattel to remove that phrase from Barbie's microchip.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n===Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing===\nIn 1994, Anita Borg and [[Telle Whitney]] founded the [[Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing]].

She dedicated her career to applying the evolving computational technologies to support advances in biology and medicine, most notably the creation of protein and nucleic acid databases and tools to interrogate the databases.  Her PhD degree was from [[Columbia University]] in the Department of Chemistry, where she devised computational methods to calculate  [[molecular resonance]] energies of several organic compounds.  She did postdoctoral studies at the Rockefeller Institute (now [[Rockefeller University]]) and the [[University of Maryland]], and joined the newly established National Biomedical Research Foundation in 1959. She was the first woman to hold office in the [[Biophysical Society]] and the first person to serve as both Secretary and eventually President.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date = 1984-07-01|title = Margaret Oakley Dayhoff 1925\u20131983|url = http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02459497|journal = Bulletin of Mathematical Biology|language = en|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 467\u2013472|doi = 10.1007/BF02459497|issn = 0092-8240}}</ref> She originated one of the first [[substitution matrix|substitution matrices]], [[Point accepted mutation]]s (''PAM''). The [[Proteinogenic amino acid|one-letter code]] used for amino acids was developed by her, reflecting an attempt to reduce the size of the data files used to describe amino acid sequences in an era of punch-card computing.\n\n==Early life==\n\nDayhoff was born an only child in [[Philadelphia]], but moved to [[New York City]] as a child. Her academic promise was evident from the outset; she was valedictorian (class of 1942) at Bayside High School, [[Bayside, New York]] and from there received a scholarship to Washington Square College of [[New York University]], graduating magna cum laude in [[mathematics]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.anb.org/articles/13/13-02174.html|title = American National Biography Online|website = www.anb.org|access-date = 2016-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nFrom there, Dayhoff undertook a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry, under [[George E. Kimball|George Kimball]], in the [[Columbia University]] Department of Chemistry. In her graduate thesis, Dayhoff had pioneered the use of computer capabilities&nbsp;\u2014 i.e., mass-data processing&nbsp;\u2014 to theoretical chemistry; specifically, she applied punch card machines to calculate the [[resonance|resonance energies]] of several [[Polycyclic compound|polycyclic]] organic molecules.\n\nAfter completing her Ph.D, Dayhoff studied [[electrochemistry]] at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] from 1948 to 1951. In 1952, she moved to Maryland with her family and later received a research fellowship from the University of Maryland (1957\u20131959), working on a model of [[chemical bonding]] with [[Ellis Lippincott]]. She taught physiology and biophysics for 13 years, while becoming affiliated with the National Biomedical Research Foundation, a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], a councillor of the International Society for the Study of the Origins of Life (1980) and acting on the editorial boards of DNA, [[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] and [[Computers in Biology and Medicine]].\n\n[[Frederick Sanger]]'s determination of the first complete amino acid sequence of a protein (insulin) in 1955, led a number of researchers to sequence various proteins from different species. In the early 1960s, a theory was developed that small differences between homologous protein sequences (sequences with a high likelihood of common ancestry) could indicate the process and rate of evolutionary change on the molecular level. The notion that such molecular analysis could help scientists decode evolutionary patterns in organisms was formalized in the published papers of [[Emile Zuckerkandl]] and [[Linus Pauling]] in 1962 and 1965. Dayhoff worked side by side with Lippincott and [[Carl Sagan]] on thermodynamic models of cosmo-chemical systems, including prebiological planetary atmospheres.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDayhoff went on to pioneer the development of programmable computer methods for use in comparing protein sequences and deriving their evolutionary histories (in other words, discerning homologies) from their [[sequence alignment]]s. Though this was before the days of massive outputs of sequence information by automated and other methods, Margaret Dayhoff anticipated the potential of computers to the current theories of [[Emile Zuckerkandl|Zuckerkandl]] & [[Linus Pauling|Pauling]] and the method which [[Frederic Sanger|Sanger]] had engineered.\n\nWith Richard Eck, she published the first reconstruction of a [[phylogeny]] ([[evolutionary tree]]) by computers from molecular sequences, using a [[maximum parsimony]] method.  She also formulated the first probability model of protein evolution, the [[Point Accepted Mutation|PAM]] model, in 1966.\n\nShe initiated the collection of protein sequences in the Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, a book collecting all known protein sequences that she published in 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/09/obituaries/margaret-oakley-dayhoff-57-expert-on-protein-structures.html|title = MARGARET OAKLEY DAYHOFF, 57; EXPERT ON PROTEIN STRUCTURES|date = 1983-02-09|newspaper = The New York Times|issn = 0362-4331|access-date = 2016-03-16}}</ref> It was subsequently republished in several editions.  This led to the [[Protein Information Resource]] database of protein sequences, which was developed by her group. It and the parallel effort by [[Walter Goad]] which led to the [[GenBank]] database of nucleic acid sequences are the twin origins of the modern databases of molecular sequences.  The Atlas was organized by [[gene family|gene families]], and she is regarded as a pioneer in their recognition.  Her approach to proteins was always determinedly evolutionary.  Margaret Oakley Dayhoff died of a heart attack at the age of 57.\n\n[[David Lipman]], director of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]], has called Dayhoff the \"mother and father of bioinformatics\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Glyn |last=Moody |year=2004 |title=Digital Code of Life: How Bioinformatics is Revolutionizing Science, Medicine, and Business | isbn= 978-0-471-32788-2}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/gallery/photo_76_7.html Picture of Margaret Oakley Dayhoff, c. 1980.] Owned by her daughter Ruth E.

She is also an Affiliate Professor at the [[University of Washington Information School]].\n\nBefore joining Microsoft in 1997, Dumais was a researcher at Bellcore (now [[Telcordia Technologies]]), where she and her colleagues conducted research into what is now called the [[vocabulary problem]] in [[information retrieval]].<ref>{{cite journal\n| title=The Vocabulary Problem in Human-System Communication\n| journal=Communications of the ACM\n| author=[[George Furnas|G.

One implication of this work is that because the author of a document may use different vocabulary than someone searching for the document, traditional [[information retrieval]] methods will have limited success.\n\nDumais and the other Bellcore researchers then began investigating ways to build search systems that avoided the vocabulary problem.  The result was their invention of [[Latent Semantic Indexing]].<ref>\n {{cite journal\n | url=http://lsi.research.telcordia.com/lsi/papers/JASIS90.pdf \n | title=Indexing by Latent Semantic Analysis\n | author=[[Scott Deerwester|S.

She was a leading member of the team which developed software for the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] rocket stage and one of the first African-Americans in her field.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAnnie Jane Easley was born to Bud McCrory and Willie Sims in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]].<ref name=AJEObit/> In the days before the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], educational and career opportunities for African American children were very limited. African American children were educated separately from white children and their schools were most often inferior to white schools. Annie was fortunate in that her mother told her that she could be anything she wanted but she would have to work at it. She encouraged her to get a good education and from the fifth grade through high school, she attended [[Holy Family Cristo Rey High School (Birmingham, Alabama)|Holy Family High School]], and was valedictorian of her graduating class.\n\nAfter high school she went to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], to [[Xavier University of Louisiana|Xavier University]], then an African-American Roman Catholic University, where she majored in [[pharmacy]] for about two years.\n\nIn 1954, she returned to Birmingham briefly. As part of the [[Jim Crow law]]s that established and maintained racial inequality, African Americans were required to pass an onerous [[literacy test]] and pay a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] in order to vote. She remembers the test giver looking at her application and saying only, \"You went to Xavier University. Two dollars.\" Subsequently, she helped other African Americans prepare for the test.\n \nIn 1963, racial segregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants ended as a result of the [[Birmingham campaign]], and in 1964, the Twenty-fourth Amendment outlawed the poll tax in Federal elections. But it was not until 1965 that the [[Voting Rights Act]] eliminated the literacy test.\n\nShortly thereafter, she married and moved to [[Cleveland]] with the intention of continuing her studies. Unfortunately, the local university had ended its pharmacy program a short time before and no nearby alternative existed.\n\n==Career at NACA and NASA==\nIn 1955, she read a local newspaper article about a story on twin sisters who worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) as \"computers\" and the next day she applied for a job. Within two weeks she was hired, one of four African Americans of about 2500 employees. She began her career in as a Mathematician and Computer Engineer at the NACA Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (which became NASA Lewis Research Center, 1958\u20131999, and subsequently the [[Glenn Research Center|John H. Glenn Research Center]]) in Cleveland, Ohio. She continued her education while working for the agency and in 1977, she obtained a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Mathematics from [[Cleveland State University]]. As part of a continuing education, Easley worked through specialization courses offered by NASA.\n\nHer 34-year career included developing and implementing computer code that analyzed alternative power technologies, supported the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] high-energy upper rocket stage, determined solar, wind and energy projects, identified energy conversion systems and alternative systems to solve energy problems.<ref>\"Easley, Annie J.: American Computer Scientist\" in ''World of Computer Science''.  Brigham Narin, Ed. (Detroit, MI: Gales Group), 2002. p. 210.</ref> Her energy assignments included studies to determine the life use of storage batteries, such as those used in electric utility vehicles. Her computer applications have been used to identify energy conversion systems that offer the improvement over commercially available technologies. She retired in 1989 (some sources say 1991).\n\nEasley's work with the Centaur project helped as technological foundations for the space shuttle launches and launches of communication, military and weather satellites. Her work contributed to the 1997 flight to Saturn of the [[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]] probe, the launcher of which had the Centaur as its upper stage.\n\nAnnie Easley was interviewed in Cleveland, on August 21, 2001 by Sandra Johnson.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Annie Easley |interviewer=Sandra Johnson |title=Annie J.

Her parents immigrated to Germany in 1929 on the last train allowed to cross the border before its closure by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities. After a few months in a [[refugee camp]], her family was allowed to immigrate to Canada, where they eventually established themselves in [[Chilliwack, British Columbia]].\n\n==Education and research==\nShe obtained both a B.A. degree, with honors, in Mathematics and Chemistry and an M.A. degree in Applied Mathematics from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1952 and 1954, respectively. She then obtained her Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Computing at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1957, pursuing coursework in quantum theory with [[Paul Dirac]]. She worked under the supervision of [[Douglas Hartree]], whom she assisted in programming the [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] (EDSAC) for atomic-structure calculations.\n\nShe served on the mathematics faculty of the University of British Columbia from 1957 till 1968, where she introduced numerical analysis and computer courses into the curriculum and was instrumental in the formation of the Computer Science Department.\n\nThe years 1963-64 were spent by Froese Fischer at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], where she extended her research on atomic-structure calculations. While at [[Harvard]], she was the first woman-scientist to be awarded an [[Alfred P. Sloan]] Fellowship. In 1991 she became a Fellow of the American Physical Society, in part for her contribution to the discovery of negative calcium. In 1995 she was elected a member of the [[Royal Physiographic Society in Lund]], in 2004 a foreign member of the [[Lithuanian Academy of Sciences]], and in 2015 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Technology from [[Malm\u00f6 University]], Sweden.\n\n==Contributions==\nShe is the author of over 300 research articles on computational atomic theory, many of which have had far-reaching impact in the area of atomic-structure calculations. The early version of the MCHF program, published in the first volume of [[Computer Physics Communications]] received two [http://www.citationclassics.org/  Citation Classics Awards] in 1987.

During this time, programming the machine meant moving dials and cables manually.\n\nIn 1946 Goldstine sat in on programming sessions with Bartik and Dick Clippinger to implement Clippinger's [[stored program]] modification to the ENIAC.  [[John von Neumann]] was a consultant on the selection of the [[instruction set]] implemented.  This solved the problem of the programmers having to unplug and replug patch cables for every program the machine was to run; instead the program was entered on the three function tables, which had previously been used only for storage of a trajectory's drag function.\n\nENIAC programmer Jean Bartik called Goldstine one of her three great programming partners along with Betty Holberton and [[Art Gehring]].<ref>\"Interview with Jean Bartik\".

Increasing the number of types or occurrences of jumps increases the family of languages accepted with finite delay. Hence the family of deterministic context-free language is a principal AFDL; there is a context-free language <math>L_0</math> such that every context-free language is an inverse [[Generalized sequential machine|gsm]] image of <math>L_0</math> or <math>L_0 - \\{e\\}</math>.\n\n\"Some restrictions on W-grammars\"\nProceedings of the sixth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, April 1974\n\n:The effect of some restrictions on [[W-grammar]]s (the formalization of the syntax of [[ALGOL 68]]) are explored. Two incomparable families examined at length are WRB (languages generated by normal regular-based W-grammars) and WS (languages generated by simple W-grammars). Both properly contain the context-free languages and are properly contained in the family of quasirealtime languages.

If new features on a telecommunications network were either undetected or unwanted, they could cause confusion and dissatisfaction among customers if not handled properly.\n\nGriffeth also researched the related problem of how to test networks to see how well they work together, called \"interoperability\". \nShe worked at the ''Next Generation Networking Lab'' at [[Lucent Technologies]] where she designed and built tools to test interoperability of Voice-over-IP networks, which included conformance testing for MeGaCo media gateways and controllers.

So during many of her lectures, she illustrated a nanosecond using salvaged obsolete Bell System 25 pair telephone cable, cut it to 11.8&nbsp;inch (30&nbsp;cm) lengths, [[Light-nanosecond|the distance that light travels in one nanosecond]], and handed out the individual wires to her listeners. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures, which is allowed by US Navy uniform regulations.\n\n{{quote|The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people.

Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out \"nanoseconds\" to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire nearly a thousand feet long, representing a [[microsecond]].

She co-founded [[Cisco Systems]], and used the money from its sale to pursue interests in [[animal welfare]] and women's writing. One of her main projects, [[Chawton House]], is in England, but most of her work remains in the United States.\n\n==Early life and education==\nShe grew up on a farm in [[northern California]].<ref name=Nicholls/> She received her [[bachelor's degree]] in 1975 in political science from [[California State University, Chico]], a [[master's degree]] in [[econometrics]] in 1977 from the [[Claremont Graduate School]], and a master's degree in statistics and computer science in 1981 from [[Stanford University]].\n\n==Cisco==\nIn 1984, while working as Director of Computer Facilities for the [[Stanford University Graduate School of Business]], Lerner co-founded [[Cisco Systems]] with her then partner (and now ex-husband) [[Len Bosack]]. It is widely reported that Lerner and Bosack designed the first router so that they could connect the incompatible computer systems of the Stanford offices they were working in so that they could send romantic love letters to each other.  However, this was a manufactured corporate legend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/supp/2006/anniversary/032706-routerman.html?t5 |title=Router man |publisher=Networkworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref><ref name=pdp10>{{cite news |title=A start-up's true tale |author=Pete Carey |url=http://pdp10.nocrew.org/docs/cisco.html |work=[[Mercury News]] |date=2001-01-12 }}</ref>  In fact, both systems (SU-SCORE and SU-GSB) were [[TOPS-20]] systems.  The systems were the same and therefore obviously not incompatible, but the SU-GSB system was not on any network. It has also been noted that the original router was designed and created by a group of people at Stanford, both students and faculty, rather than Lerner and Bosack alone.<ref name=pdp10/>\n\nLerner and Bosack brought in [[John Morgridge]] to be the third CEO of Cisco in 1988.  On August 28, 1990, Lerner was fired; upon hearing the news, Bosack resigned to show his support for her.

The house still stands.\n\nLerner is involved in a number of high-tech and philanthropic activities.  In 1992, through the foundation she shares with Leonard Bosack, she invested money into the restoration of [[Chawton House]], the [[manor house]] in the English county of [[Hampshire]] that had been owned by [[Jane Austen]]'s brother, [[Edward Austen Knight]].  Chawton House opened in 2003 as  the Centre for the Study of Early Women's Writing, 1600-1830. The [[Chawton House Library]] has a collection of over 9,000 books, mainly related to the [[literary genre]] of [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]], and original [[manuscript]]s. The Library works in partnership with the [[University of Southampton]], and provides an important resource for the university's [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 18th Century Study.<ref>[http://www.chawtonhouse.org/education/southampton.html Chawton House Website Southampton Section]</ref> Lerner was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] by Southampton in recognition of this work\n\nShe started moving to Virginia in 1995.

Her mother remained bitter towards Lord Byron and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing what she saw as the [[insanity]] seen in her father, but Ada remained interested in him despite this (and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request). Often ill, she spent most of her childhood sick.  Ada married [[William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King]] in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, and she became Countess of Lovelace.\n\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as [[Andrew Crosse]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]], which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=234\u2013235}} and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nAs a  teenager, her mathematical talents led her to an ongoing working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician [[Charles Babbage]], also known as 'the father of computers', and in particular, Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, [[Mary Somerville]]. Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer [[Luigi Menabrea]] on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ''Notes''. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early [[history of computers]]. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003|pp=19, 25}} Her mind-set of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.<ref name=ABCL>{{Citation|last=Toole|first=Betty Alexandra|title=Poetical Science|journal=The Byron Journal|volume=15|year=1987|pages=55\u201365|doi=10.3828/bj.1987.6}}.</ref>\n\nShe died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Childhood===\nByron expected his baby to be a \"glorious boy\" and was disappointed when his wife gave birth to a girl.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=35}} Augusta was named after Byron's half-sister, [[Augusta Leigh]], and was called \"Ada\" by Byron himself.{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=17}}\n\n[[File:Miniature of Ada Byron.jpg|thumb|Ada, aged four]]\nOn 16 January 1816 Annabella, at Byron's behest, left for her parents' home at [[Kirkby Mallory]] taking one-month-old Ada with her.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=35}} Although English law at the time gave fathers full custody of their children in cases of separation, Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=16}} but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=80}} On 21 April Byron signed the Deed of Separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=36\u201338}} Aside from an acrimonious separation, Annabella continually made allegations about Byron's immoral behaviour throughout her life.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=74\u201377}}\n\nThis set of events made Ada famous in Victorian society. Byron did not have a relationship with his daughter, and never saw her again. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.<ref name=\"Turney p. 138\">{{Harvnb|Turney|1972|p=138}}.</ref> Ada was not shown the family portrait of her father (covered in green shroud) until her twentieth birthday.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=10}} Her mother became Baroness Wentworth in her own right in 1856.\n\nAnnabella did not have a close relationship with the young Ada, and often left her in the care of her own mother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her grandchild. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Annabella had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about Ada's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=85\u201387}} In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to Ada as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=86}} In her teenage years, several of her mother's close friends watched Ada for any sign of moral deviation. Ada dubbed these observers the \"Furies\", and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=119}}\n\n[[File:Ada Byron aged seventeen (1832).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ada, aged seventeen, 1832]]\nAda was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.{{Sfn | Stein|1985|p=17}} In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of [[measles]]. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite being ill Ada developed her mathematical and technological skills. At age 12 this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires and feathers. She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book ''Flyology'' illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need, for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".<ref name=ABCL/>\n\nIn early 1833 Ada had an affair with a tutor and, after being caught, tried to elope with him. The tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Annabella and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=120\u201321}} Ada never met her younger half-sister, [[Allegra Byron|Allegra]], the daughter of Lord Byron and [[Claire Clairmont]]. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Ada did have some contact with [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]], the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Ada as much as possible when introduced at Court.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=155}}\n\n===Adult years===\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor [[Mary Somerville]], who would introduce her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=138\u201340}} and the two of them corresponded for many years.  Other acquaintances included the scientists [[Andrew Crosse]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]]. She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], Byron's friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\".{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=138\u201339}} This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably because of the influence of her mother, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=139}}\n\nOn 8 July 1835 she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William, 8th Baron King]],<ref name=williamkings group=lower-alpha>Sources disagree on whether William King, her maths tutor, and William King, her later husband, were the same person.</ref> becoming Lady King.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2744.htm#i27434|contribution=Ada Augusta Byron|title=The Peerage |date=31 Jan 2012 <!--citing Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, vol 1, 2003 p630-->}}.</ref> Their residence was [[Ockham Park]], a large estate in [[Surrey]], along with another estate on [[Torridon|Loch Torridon]] in [[Ross-shire]], and a home in London. They spent their honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near [[Porlock Weir]], Somerset. The Manor had been built as a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon. It later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time.\n\nThey had three children: [[Byron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham|Byron]] (born 12 May 1836); [[Lady Anne Blunt|Anne Isabella]] (called Annabella; born 22 September 1837); and [[Ralph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace|Ralph Gordon]] (born 2 July 1839). Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced \"a tedious and suffering illness, which took months to cure.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=139}} Ada was a descendant of the extinct [[Baron Lovelace|Barons Lovelace]] and in 1838, her husband was made [[Earl of Lovelace]] and Viscount Ockham,<ref>{{cite web|title=Lovelace, Earl of|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/lovelace1838.htm|publisher=Cracroft's Peerage|date=2005}}</ref> meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace. In 1843\u201344, Ada's mother assigned [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] to teach Ada's children, and to act as a 'moral' instructor for Ada.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=285\u201386}} He quickly fell for her, and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he'd never act in an \"unbecoming\" manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=289\u201396}}\n\nIn 1841 Lovelace and [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh|Medora Leigh]] (the daughter of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Ada's mother that her father was also Medora's father.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=159}} On 27 February 1841 Ada wrote to her mother: \"I am not in the least ''astonished''. In fact you merely ''confirm'' what I have for ''years and years'' felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=160}} She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: \"I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was.\"{{Sfn|Moore|1961|p=431}} In the 1840s Ada flirted with scandals: firstly from a relaxed relationship with men who were not her husband, which led to rumours of affairs{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=302}}\u2014and secondly, her love of gambling. The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=340\u201342}} She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=336\u201337}} During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=361}}\n\n===Education===\nThroughout her illnesses, she continued her education.{{Sfn|Stein|1985|pp=28\u201330}} Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]], [[William King (physician)|William King]], and [[Mary Somerville]], the noted researcher and scientific author of the 19th century. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician [[Augustus De Morgan]]. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=82}}\n\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying [[differential calculus]], she wrote to De Morgan:\n<blockquote>I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in ''one'' shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar{{Sfn|Toole|1998|p=99}}</blockquote> \nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued [[metaphysics]] as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring \"the unseen worlds around us\".{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=91\u2013100}}\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Ada Lovelace in 1852.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Ada Lovelace at a piano in 1852 by Henry Phillips.

Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=370}} She lost contact with her husband after she confessed something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. What she told him is unknown.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=369}} She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.\n\n==Work==\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including [[phrenology]]{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=198}} and [[mesmerism]].{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=232\u201333}} After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\").{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=305}} She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=310\u201314}} In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron [[Karl von Reichenbach]], ''Researches on Magnetism'', but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=315\u201317}} In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=335}}\n\n[[File:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Ada by British painter [[Margaret Sarah Carpenter]] (1836)]]\nLovelace first met [[Charles Babbage]] in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his [[Difference Engine]].{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=36\u201338}} She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills.

With the article, she appended a set of notes.{{Sfn|Menabrea|1843}} Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was uninterested in it.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=265}} Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=267}} Her work was well received at the time; the scientist [[Michael Faraday]] described himself as a supporter of her writing.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p = 307}}\n\nThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in Section G<ref name=\"fourmilab.ch\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html|title=Sketch of ''The Analytical Engine'', with notes upon the Memoir by the Translator|publisher=fourmilab.ch|place=[[Switzerland]]|date=|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>), in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of [[Bernoulli numbers]] with the Engine, which could have run correctly{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} had the Analytical Engine been built (only his Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage|title=The Babbage Engine|publisher=Computer History Museum|year=2008}}</ref>). Based on this work Lovelace is now widely considered the first computer programmer<ref name=\"Annals of the History of Computing\" /> and her method is recognised as the world's first computer program.<ref>Gleick, J. (2011) ''[[The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood]]'', London, Fourth Estate, pp. 116\u2013118.</ref>\n\nSection G also contains Lovelace's dismissal of [[artificial intelligence]]. She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do ''whatever we know how to order it'' to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by [[Alan Turing]] in his paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEMYUU_HFMAC&pg=PA67&f=false |journal=The Turing Test: Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |editor=Stuart Shieber |title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence |author=Alan Turing |pages=67\u2013104 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (a criticism of the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface\u2014which would imply that she had written that also. When [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Taylor]]'s ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian [[Benjamin Woolley]] theorised that, \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her&nbsp;... because of her 'celebrated name'.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=277\u201380}} Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as ''Philosopher's Walk'', as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=307}}\n\n===First computer program===\n[[File:Diagram for the computation of Bernoulli numbers.jpg|thumb|Lovelace's diagram from Note G, the first published computer algorithm]]\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the [[University of Turin]] about his Analytical Engine. [[Luigi Menabrea]], a young Italian engineer, and the future [[Prime Minister of Italy]], wrote up Babbage's lecture in [[French language|French]], and this transcript was subsequently published in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve]] in October 1842.\nBabbage's friend [[Charles Wheatstone]] commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in Taylor's ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' under the [[initialism]] ''AAL''.\n\nIn 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished. The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.<ref>{{citation|editor-first1= Robin |editor-last1= Hammerman |editor-first2=Andrew L. |editor-last2= Russell| title=Ada's Legacy: Cultures of Computing from the Victorian to the Digital Age |publisher=Morgan & Claypool |year=2015|doi=10.1145/2809523}}</ref>\n\nAda Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an [[algorithm]] for the Analytical Engine to compute [[Bernoulli number]]s. It is considered the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.<ref>{{cite web|last=Simonite|first=Tom|url=http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/03/ada-lovelace-day.html|title=Short Sharp Science: Celebrating Ada Lovelace: the 'world's first programmer'| work= [[New Scientist]]|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Matt|title=Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension|date=2014|publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux|isbn=0374275653|page=261}}</ref> The engine was never completed so her program was never tested.{{sfn|Kim|Toole|1999}}\n\n===Beyond numbers===\nIn her notes, Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity.{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=175\u201382}} She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote:\n{{Quote|[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides ''number'', were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lovelace|first1=Ada|last2=Menabrea|first2=Luigi|title=Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage Esq.|date=1842|journal=[[Scientific Memoirs]]|publisher=Richard Taylor|page=694}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=Rowan|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22385-ada-lovelace-my-brain-is-more-than-merely-mortal.html|title=Ada Lovelace: My brain is more than merely mortal|work=New Scientist|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices, and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. [[Walter Isaacson]] ascribes Lovelace's insight regarding the application of computing to ''any'' process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used [[punched cards|punchcards]] to direct the weaving of beautiful [[pattern]]s, it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson\">Isaacson, Walter. \"[http://fortune.com/2014/09/18/walter-isaacson-the-women-of-eniac/ Walter Isaacson on the women of ENIAC].\" Fortune magazine. 18 September 2014.</ref> This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer [[John Graham-Cumming]], whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=2\u20133, 14}}{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=272\u201377}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Kent|first=Leo|url=http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|title=The 10-year-plan to build Babbage's Analytical Engine|publisher=Humans Invent|date=17 September 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy over extent of contributions===\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers and historians of computing claim the contrary.\n\n[[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan G.

She is co-founder and CEO of the production company [[Revelations Entertainment]], which she co-founded with actor [[Morgan Freeman]].\n\nMcCreary graduated from [[UCLA]] with a degree in Computer Science.  While still in college, she co-founded software company CompuLaw.\n\nMcCreary's appreciation for the stage play ''[[Bopha!]]'' inspired her to go into motion picture production.  Actor [[Morgan Freeman]] was signed to direct the film.  Later, the pair partnered in the formation of [[Revelations Entertainment]] in 1996 with a mission to produce entertainment that reveals truth.  As Revelations CEO, McCreary most recently produced ''[[The Magic of Belle Isle]]'', directed by [[Rob Reiner]].  Before that, she produced ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'', directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], with Freeman starring in the long-awaited portrayal of [[Nelson Mandela]] and co-starring [[Matt Damon]].  In addition, she serves as the Executive Producer of Discovery Science's ''[[Through the Wormhole With Morgan Freeman]]''. Utilizing the latest work at NASA, the series explores how astrobiology, string theory, quantum mechanics and astrophysics are pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the universe.\n\nMcCreary's additional producer credits include Mimi Leder's ''[[Thick as Thieves (2009 film)|Thick as Thieves]]'' with [[Antonio Banderas]] and ''[[The Maiden Heist]]'' starring [[Christopher Walken]], [[William H. Macy]], [[Marcia Gay Harden]] and [[Morgan Freeman]].  Revelations also co-produced ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]'' for Paramount Pictures.\n\nIn July 2005, Revelations Entertainment teamed with [[Intel]] to form a new digital entertainment company, [[ClickStar]]. ClickStar officially launched their site on December 15, 2006, where it was the first website to legally make a movie (Revelation's ''[[10 Items or Less (film)|10 Items or Less]]'') available for download while it was still in theaters.\n\nMcCreary sits on the Board of the [[Producers Guild of America]] and as of June 2014, was elected President of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) along with [[Gary Lucchesi]].  McCreary still holds this post.  She is the Founder of the PGA's Motion Picture Technology Committee and sits on the Producers Council of the PGA and on the Technology Committee of the American Society of Cinematographers. She is also a member of The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers ([[SMPTE]]) and The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. ([[IEEE]]). In addition, she was profiled by [[The Hollywood Reporter]] in its 100 Most Powerful Women in [[Hollywood]] issue.\n\n==Filmography==\n* Madam Secretary (CBS TV Series 2014/2015) Seasons 1 and 2\n* Curiosity: Season 1, Episode 5 - Is There a Parallel Universe?

The first job was important for her career as an academic, since it involved looking after personnel policy and industrial relations strategy for a large number of women staff. The second job also proved invaluable, as she was running a production department, providing a level of practical experience that is unusual among academics.<ref name = \"Mum\">[http://www.enid.u-net.com/Biography.htm Enid Mumford Biography]. Accessed 3 Nov 2008.</ref>\n\nEnid Mumford then joined the Faculty of Social Science at [[Liverpool University]] in 1956.<ref name=\"TR 2006\"/> Later she then spent a year at the [[University of Michigan]], where she worked for the University Bureau of Public Health Economics and studied Michigan medical facilities while her husband took a higher degree in dental science. On returning to England, she joined the newly formed [[Manchester Business School]] (MBS), where she undertook many research contracts investigating the human and organisational impacts of computer based systems. During this time she became Professor of Organisational Behaviour and Director of the Computer and Work Design Research Unit (CAWDRU). She also directed the MBA programme for four years.<ref name = \"Mum\"/>\n\nShe was a companion of the [[Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development]], a Fellow of the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS), also an Honorary Fellow of the BCS in 1984,<ref>{{cite web|title=Role of Honorory Fellows|website=http://ww.bcs.org/conWebDoc/1650|publisher=BCS|accessdate=23 June 2014}}</ref> and also a founder member and ex-chairperson of the BCS Sociotechnical Group.\n\nIn 1983 Enid Mumford was awarded the American Warnier Prize for her contributions to information science. In 1996, she was given an Honorary Doctorate by the university of Jyvaskyla in Finland. And in 1999, she was the only British recipient of a [[Association for Information Systems#Leo Award|Leo Lifetime Achievement Award]] for Exceptional Achievement in Information Systems, one of only four in that year. Leo Awards are given by the Association for Information Systems (AIS) and the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS).\n\n== Work ==\n\n=== Research in industrial relations ===\nAt the Faculty of Social Science at [[Liverpool University]] Mumford carried out research in industrial relations in the Liverpool docks and in the North West coal industry.<ref name=\"TR 2006\"/> In order to collect information for the dock research, she became a canteen assistant in the canteens used by the stevedores for meals. Each canteen was in a different part of the waterfront estate and served dockers working on different shipping lines and with different cargoes. The coal mine research required her to spend many months underground talking to miners at the coal face.<ref name = \"Mum\"/>\n\n=== Human factors and socio-technical systems ===\nEarly in her career Enid Mumford realised that the implementation of large [[computer systems]] generally resulted in failure to produce a satisfactory outcome. Such failure could arise even when the underlying technology was adequate. She demonstrated that the underlying cause was an inability to overcome human factors associated with the implementation and use of computers. Four decades later, despite the identification of these sociotechnical factors and the development of methodologies to overcome such problems, large scale computer implementations are often unsuccessful in practice.\n\n=== The socio-technical approach ===\nWhile at MBS, Mumford developed a close relationship with the Tavistock Institute and became interested in their democratic socio-technical approach to work organisation. Since then, she has applied this approach to the design and implementation of computer-based systems and information technology. One of her largest socio-technical projects was with the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in Boston. In the 1970s she became a member of the International Quality of Working Life Group, the goal of which was to spread the socio-technical message around the world. She later became a council member of the [[Tavistock Institute]]<ref name=\"TR 2006\"/> and was also a member of the US Socio-technical Round Table.<ref name = \"Mum\"/>\n\n== Publications ==\nEnid Mumford has produced a large number of publications and books in the field of sociotechnical design. A selection:\n* 1989. ''XSEL's Progress: the continuing journey of an expert system''. Wiley.\n* 1995. ''Effective Systems Design and Requirements Analysis: the ETHICS Approach''. Macmillan.\n* 1996.

Sloan Professor of Information Technologies and Organization Studies at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].\n\n== Biography ==\nOrlikowski received her B.Comm from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in 1977, an M. Comm from the same university in 1982, and a Ph.D. from the [[New York University]] [[Stern School of Business]] in 1989.\n\nShe has served as a visiting Centennial Professor of Information Systems at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], and was a visiting professor at the Judge Business School at the [[University of Cambridge]]. She is currently the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Information Technologies and Organization Studies at MIT's Sloan School of Management. \n\nOrlikowski has served as a senior editor for ''[[Organization Science (journal)|Organization Science]]'', and currently serves on the editorial boards of ''Information and Organization'' and ''[[Organization Science (journal)|Organization Science]]''.\n\nShe is a member of the Academy of Management, the Association of Computing Machinery, the Institute of Management Science, the Society of Information Management, and the Society for Organizational Learning.\n\n== Work ==\nOrlikowski's research examines relations between technology and organizations over time, with emphases on organizing structures, cultural norms, communication genres, and work practices. She is best known for her work in studying the implementation and use of technologies within organisations by drawing on [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Giddens]]' Theory of [[Structuration]].\n\nOrlikowski has written extensively on the use of electronic communication technologies, most notably collaborating with [[JoAnne Yates]], a professor of communications at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. She has also written papers on research methodology and her 1991 paper with Jack Baroudi in ''[[Information Systems Research]]'' is particularly widely cited. Her most recent work examines the sociomaterial practices entailed in social media.\n\n=== Structurational studies of technology and organizations ===\nStructurational studies of technology and organizations have been highly influenced by the social studies of technology. Initially arguing for a view of the \"duality of technology,\" Orlikowski went on to argue for a practice-based understanding of the recursive interaction between people and technologies over time. Orlikowski (2000) argues that emergent structures offer a more generative view of technology use, suggesting that users do not so much appropriate technologies as they [[enactment (psychology)|enact]] particular technologies-in-practice with them. The ongoing enactment of technologies-in-practice either reproduce existing structural conditions or they produce changes that may lead to structural transformation.\n\nBased on a series of empirical studies of collaborative technologies (groupware), Orlikowski identified at least three types of [[enactment (psychology)|enactment]] produced within different conditions and producing different consequences associated with humans engagement with technology in practice. \n* [[Social inertia]] leads to reinforcement and preservation of structural status quo. Human action with the use of technology tends to be incremental, with people using technology to continue their existing work practices. In the case of collaborative software, this included rigid career hierarchies, individualistic incentives, and competitive cultures. \n* [[Application (virtue)|Application]] which arises as people begin to use the technology in new ways within their practices. Such use tends to produce noticeable changes to existing information, tools, and artifacts, as well as work relations and practices. \n* [[Social change]], where people tend to integrate the technology into their ways of working so as to produce transformations in work relations and practices. Such changes can lead to important transformations in the structural status quo.\n\n===New ways of dealing with materiality in organizational research===\nIn more recent work, Orlikowski argues that that our primary ways of dealing with materiality in organizational research are conceptually problematic and proposes an alternative approach that posits materiality as constitutive of everyday life. This work draws on [[Karen Barad]]'s [[agential realism]] and the notion of [[sociomateriality]] as influenced by the work of [[Lucy Suchman]] and [[Annemarie Mol]].\n\nIn co-authored work, Orlikowski and Susan Scott of the [[London School of Economics]] argue for a focus on sociomaterial practices within organizational and information system studies. This recognizes that all practices are always and everywhere sociomaterial, and that this sociomateriality is constitutive of the contours and possibilities of everyday organizing.\n\n===Awards===\nOrlikowski won the Lasting Impact Award from the ACM CSCW conference in 2015 <ref name=\"CSCW\">{{cite web | url=http://cscw.acm.org/2015/program/lasting_impact.php | title=Lasting Impact Award | publisher=ACM | accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> for her paper \"Learning from Notes: organizational issues in groupware implementation\".<ref name=\"learning-from-notes\">{{cite conference | url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=143457.143549&coll=DL&dl=ACM | title=Learning from Notes: organizational issues in groupware implementation | publisher=ACM | accessdate=17 March 2015 | author=Orlikowski, Wanda | booktitle=Proceedings of CSCW | year=1992 | conference=CSCW | location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada | pages=362\u2013369}}</ref>\n\n== Select bibliography ==\n*Orlikowski, W.J. and J.J.

Picard's former students include [[Steve Mann]], professor and researcher in wearable computers.\n\n===Affective computing===\nWhile working in the field of affective computing, Picard published ''Affective Computing''. MIT's press release for Picard's textbook states, \"According to Rosalind Picard, if we want computers to be genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have and express emotions\".<ref name=\"affective\"/>\n\nPicard explains the need to monitor emotional cues and how this is present with humans when she states:\n:\"Whatever his strategy, the good teacher detects important affective cues from the student and responds differently because of them. For example, the teacher might leave subtle hints or clues for the student to discover, thereby preserving the learner's sense of self-propelled discovery. Whether the subject matter involves deliberate emotional expression as is the case with music, or is a \"non-emotional\" topic such as science, the teacher that attends to a student's interest, pleasure, and distress is perceived as more effective than the teacher that proceeds callously. The best teachers know that frustration usually precedes quitting, and know how to redirect or motivate the pupil at such times. They get to know their student, including how much distress that student can withstand before learning breaks down.\"<ref name=\"Affective Computing\">Picard, Rosalind. ''Affective Computing''. [[MIT Press]], 1997. p. 93-94</ref>\nBut such emotional cues are not part of robotic intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn order to portray how such a recognition would alter interactions with robots, Picard gave an example situation:\n:Imagine your robot entering the kitchen as you prepare breakfast for guests. The robot looks happy to see you and greets you with a cheery \"Good morning.\" You mumble something it does not understand. It notices your face, vocal tone, smoke above the stove, and your slamming of a pot into the sink, and infers that you do not appear to be having a good morning. Immediately, it adjusts its internal state to \"subdued,\" which has the effect of lowering its vocal pitch and amplitude settings, eliminating cheery behavioral displays, and suppressing unnecessary conversation. Suppose you exclaim, \"Ow!!\" yanking your hand from the hot stove, rushing to run your fingers under cold water, adding \"I can't believe I ruined the sauce.\" While the robot's speech recognition may not have high confidence that it accurately recognized all of your words, its assessment of your affect and actions indicates a high probability that you are upset and maybe hurt.<ref name=\"scholarpedia\">[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Affective_computing] (article by R.Picard) {{wayback|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Affective_computing |date=20071222054934 }}</ref>\nIn such a situation, it is necessary for the robots to understand the emotional aspects of humans in order to better serve their intended purpose.\n\nHer work has influenced many fields beyond computer science, ranging from video games<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Binkley|first=Timothy|title=Autonomous Creations: Birthing Intelligent Agents|journal=Leonardo|volume=31|issue=5|year=1998|page=336|doi=10.2307/1576591|jstor=1576591|publisher=The MIT Press|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> to law.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Peter H.|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=313842|title=International Environmental Law and Emotional Rational Choice|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|volume=31|issue=1|date=January 2002|pages=S245|postscript=<!--None-->|doi=10.1086/342008}}</ref> One critic, [[Aaron Sloman]], described the book as having a \"bold vision\" that will inspire some and irritate others.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sloman|first=Aaron|authorlink=Aaron Sloman|title=Review of Affective Computing|publisher=AI Magazine|year=1999|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Other critics emphasize the importance behind the work as it establishes an important framework for the field as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|last=Diehl |first=Stanford |url=http://www.byte.com/art/9802/sec3/art9.htm |title=Book Review: A Computer to Love |publisher=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]] |date=February 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20050420205157/http://byte.com:80/art/9802/sec3/art9.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2005 }}</ref> Picard responded to Sloman's review by saying, \"I don\u2019t think the review captures the flavor of the book.

With devices that can measure heart-rate, electrodermal activity, and other physiological changes, and that are non-obtrusive and simple to wear (Picard uses an example of the iCalm sensor) emotional responses can be more accurately observed in a real life. She also argues against [[nomothetic]] research over [[idiographic]] research when it comes to studying emotions claiming that an individualized approach would be more fruitful than just throwing out data when a group correlation is not found. In this way, data from individuals could still be kept and analyzed and then paired (not averaged) with data clusters that were similar.<ref>Picard, Rosalind J.

Similar in some respects to the [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] reference model, but with a number of differences. SNA is essentially composed of seven layers. She worked for IBM for 25 years and was named an [[IBM Fellow]] in 1994 in recognition of her work on APPN and AnyNet architectures and development. She was tasked with the network and application design for the 1998 and 2000 Olympics. Her work life has largely been focused on networking and software engineering, including: \n* developing networking protocols\n* deploying the network at the Nagano Olympics\n* development processes\n* storage networking\n* application development\n* mobile computing\nShe has worked in development, design, and architecture and two areas that she has become particularly interested in later in here career are improving quality and blending theory and practice.\n\nPozefsky was awarded the Women in Technology International (WITI) 2011 Hall of Fame Award for contributions to the fields of Science and Technology.<ref>http://www.witi.com/center/conferences/2011/summit/</ref>\n\nAdditional professional interests include:\n* [[knowledge management]]\n* [[National Engineers Week]]\n* women in technology\n* improving ties between universities and industry\n* using technology to improve teleworking and remote teams\n\nDr. Diane Pozefsky returned to UNC after retiring from IBM in June 2004.\n\n== Publications ==\nPozefsky's publications include:\n* \u201cStorage Networking: More than an SNA Anagram\u201d in NCP and 3745/46 Today, Summer 2001.\n* \u201cMPTN Transport Gateway\u201d, with D.

She received an honorary D.Sc. from Mount Holyoke College in 1978.<ref>Stanley, Autumn, ''Mothers and Daughters of Invention'', Metuchen, New Jersey: Scarecrow Press, 1993, p. 683</ref>\n\nSammet was employed by [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry Gyroscope]] from 1955 to 1958 where she supervised the first scientific programming group.  From 1958 to 1961, she worked for [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] as a staff consultant for programming research and a member of the original [[COBOL]] group. She joined [[IBM]] in 1961  where she developed FORMAC, the first widely used computer language for symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas. At IBM she researched the use of restricted English as a programming language and the use of natural language for mathematical programs.  She was Programming Technology Planning Manager for the Federal Systems Division from 1968 to 1974, and was appointed Software Technology Manager in 1979.<ref>{{ cite web | title= Jean E. Sammet | work= IEEE Computer Society Awards | url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/awards/sammet | accessdate= 2011-04-22 }}</ref>\n\nSammet founded the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SICSAM) in 1965 and was Chair of the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN). She was  the first female president of the ACM, from 1974 to 1976.<ref>Stanley, ''Mothers and Daughters of Invention'', p. 685</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJean E. Sammet was born on March 23, 1928 in New York City. Jean and her sister Helen were born to Harry and Ruth Sammet who were both lawyers. Jean and Helen attended public elementary schools in Manhattan. Sammet had a strong interest in mathematics but was unable to attend the [[The Bronx High School of Science|Bronx High School of Science]] because it did not accept girls. Instead, Sammet attended Julia Richman High School.<ref name=\"bergin\"/>\n\nSammet chose to enroll at [[Mount Holyoke College]] based on the strength of its mathematics program. Sammet majored in mathematics and took education courses, which allowed her to be certified to teach high school mathematics in New York. She minored in political science. After graduating from Mount Holyoke, Sammet pursued graduate studies at the [[University of Illinois]], where she received her MA in 1949. While taking courses toward a Ph.D., she was a teaching assistant in the Mathematics department at the University of Illinois from 1948 to 1951.<ref name=\"bergin\"/>\n\nIn 1951 Sammet began looking for a position in education. Sammet was forced to search for positions in New Jersey because New York City was not hiring new teachers. The authorities in New Jersey determined that Sammet was missing two courses from her studies: a course in education and one in the history of New Jersey. Sammet fought this determination, stating that her knowledge of New Jersey history did not strengthen her ability to teach mathematics in high school. This forced Sammet to seek other types of employment.<ref name=\"bergin\"/>\n\n== Work ==\n\nIn 1951, Sammet took a position at the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]] as a trainee actuary. She agreed to participate in an in-house training program to learn about [[punched card accounting]] machines. Sammet took to the electronic accounting machines, but was unable to work with the machines after her training was complete. She left her position at the insurance office and enrolled at [[Columbia University]] to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics. Sammet worked as a teaching assistant at [[Barnard College]] during the 1952-1953 school year before decided that the academic life was not for her.<ref name=\"bergin\"/>\n\nFrom 1953 to 1958, Sammet was a mathematician for Sperry Gyroscope in New York. She spent time working on mathematical analysis problems for clients and ran an analog computer. Sammet worked on the Department of the Navy\u2019s submarine program during her time there. In early January 1955, Sammet began her life as a programmer. [[Sperry Gyroscope]] was working on a digital computer, the Sperry Electronic Digital Automatic Computer ([[SPEEDAC]]) and asked Sammet to be their programmer. Her first task was to write the basic loader for the SPEEDAC, which was a 20-line program that took three days to toggle into the computer by hand in binary.<ref name=\"bergin\"/>\n\nSammet became the group leader of what was called an \u201copen shop\u201d as Sperry began hiring more programmers. The \u201copen shop\u201d consisted of programmers acting as consultants to the engineers and involved scientists who assisted them in writing and testing their routines. The group produced other system software and focused on scientific and engineering computations. In 1955 Sperry Gyroscope and Remington Rand merged and became Sperry Rand. This merger allowed Sammet access to the [[UNIVAC I]] computer and [[Grace Hopper]].<ref name=\"bergin\"/>\n\nIn fall of 1956, Sammet taught one of the earliest graduate-level courses in computer programming in the Applied Mathematics department of [[Adelphi College]] (now University) on Long Island. Despite the fact that Adelphi did not have a computer and few textbooks on programming existed at the time, Sammet was able to instruct two courses for two years.<ref name=\"bergin\"/>\n\nSammet decided to leave Sperry to work for a company with computers as its focal point. The classifieds at the time were separated by gender and Sammet was unable to find a position for a woman in any field she was interested in so she decided to scan the men\u2019s list and found an engineer position at [[Sylvania Electric Products]] in Needham, Massachusetts. Sammet was instead hired to oversee software development for the [[MOBIDIC]] project by Carl Hammer, the person responsible for Sylvania\u2019s software development.<ref name=\"bergin\"/>\n\n=== Relationship with ACM ===\n\nAround 1965 or 1966, Sammet noticed a need for the exchange of intellectual information with others working with languages and software while she worked on [[FORMAC]].<ref>Davis, Charles H. \"Computer Programming for Librarians\" Journal for Education Leadership. Vol 18. No. 1 pp.41-52</ref> She was a member of ACM for a number of years but was not active until she became interested in starting a special interest group that would allow her to speak with other professionals in the field. After a couple of failed attempts at contacting the person in charge of Special Interest Groups and Special Interest Committees at ACM, Sammet contacted George Forsythe, president of ACM from 1964 to 1966, who named her Chairperson of the Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation.<ref name=\"oralhist\">{{cite news|author1=Bergin, Thomas J.|author2=Sammet, J.E.|year=2006|title=Jean E.

She identified people at Bell Labs, Carnegie Mellon, and IBM who were in different divisions and groups. Sammet faced resistance from the interest group on numerical analysis in ACM. Roughly five years after SICSAM formed, there was a conference about mathematical software called SIGNUM. Sammet states that she fought her way to give a paper at SIGNUM because the group was not interested in non-numerical analysis of that kind of an activity. With assistance from those interested in SICSAM, Sammet organized a conference held in March 1966, which was the Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SYMSAM).<ref name=\"oralhist\"/>\n\nIn June 1966, Tony Oettinger was elected president of ACM and Sammet was elected the Northeast Regional Representative (1966-1968). She was also a member of the ACM Council and ACM lecturer (1967, 1968, and 1972). Bernie Galler was elected president of ACM in 1968 and in August 1968, Sammet became Chairperson of the ACM Committee on SIGs and SICs.<ref name=\"oralhist\"/>\n\nIn 1971 she was elected chair of SIGPLAN. She served one year of a two-year term before resigning because she was elected vice president of ACM in 1972. As chairperson of SIGPLAN, she organized conferences between SIGPLAN and various Special Interest Groups. Sammet has stated that these conferences were organized based on the recognition of how fundamental programming languages were to different aspects within computing.<ref name=\"oralhist\"/>\n\nSammet served as vice president of ACM from June 1972 to June 1974. Working with the president of ACM at the time, Tony Ralston, Sammet made the finances of ACM a priority. At the time of her vice presidency, ACM was almost bankrupt. Sammet convinced Ralston to hold a member-office forum prior to their annual conference. Sammet encouraged this based on her recognition that ACM had no realistic way of communicating with the membership.<ref name=\"oralhist\"/>\n\n==Selected works==\n* {{cite book | last = Sammet | first = Jean E.| title = Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals | publisher = [[Prentice-Hall]] | year = 1969 | isbn = 0-13-729988-5 }}\n* {{cite journal|author=Sammet, Jean E.|title=Programming Languages: History and Future|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=15|number=7|date=July 1972|pages=601\u2013610|doi=10.1145/361454.361485}} \n* ''Detailed Description of COBOL'', 1960\n\n==Awards==\n* 1975: inducted as an Honorary Member of UPE (the International Honor Society for the Computing and Information Sciences) on October 8, 1975.\n* 1989: Lovelace Award Recipient, Association for Women in Computing.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20080309214223/http://www.awc-hq.org/lovelace/1989.htm</ref>\n* 1994: [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]\n* 1997: [[SIGPLAN]] ''Distinguished Service Award'' (J.A.N.

See also [http://brokenballots.com]</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nAfter receiving her Ph.D. in 1981 in computer science from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], she joined the Research Division of [[IBM]], from which she took early retirement in 1998. In 1992, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' featured her in a special edition on women in science.  In 2005 Simons became the first woman to receive the Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award from the College of Engineering of U.C. Berkeley.\n\nShe served on the President\u2019s Export Council\u2019s Subcommittee on Encryption and on the Information Technology-Sector of the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion.  She is on the Board of Directors of VerifiedVoting.org.  She has also been on the boards of the U.C. Berkeley Engineering Fund, the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]], Public Knowledge, and the Oxford Internet Institute, as well as the Advisory Council of the Public Interest Registry\u2019s ORG.  She has testified before both the U.S. and state legislatures and at government sponsored hearings.  She was runner-up in the first (and only) election for the North America seat on the ICANN Board.\n\nSimons co-founded the Reentry Program for Women and Minorities in the Computer Science Department at U.C. Berkeley.  She is also on the Boards of the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC) and the Berkeley Foundation for Opportunities in Information Technology (BFOIT), groups that work at increasing participation in computer science of women and underrepresented minorities.\n\n==Work on voting technology policy==\n\nSince at least 2002 Simons has been a critic of unauditable [[electronic voting]] and is generally credited as a key player in getting the [[League of Women Voters]] to change its stance on this issue. Initially the League had seen electronic voting mainly as a way to minimize invalidly cast ballots, but at their June 2004 convention she led a successful fight to get this policy reversed to one of giving priority to [[voting machines]] that are \"[[recount]]able\".<ref>[[Ronnie Dugger]], \"How They Could Steal the Election This Time\", ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', p.13 August 16/23, 2004</ref>\n\nShe was a member of the National Workshop on Internet Voting that was convened at the request of President Clinton and produced a report on Internet Voting in 2001.  She also participated on the Security Peer Review Group for the US [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]\u2019s Internet voting project (SERVE) and co-authored the report that led to the cancellation of SERVE because of security concerns.<ref>David Jefferson, [[Avi Rubin|Aviel D.

Agreeing to the challenge, Wilson designed the system including the circuit board and components from Monday to Wednesday, which required fast new [[DRAM]] [[integrated circuits]] to be sourced directly from [[Hitachi]]. By Thursday evening, a prototype had been built, but the software had [[bug (software)|bugs]], requiring Wilson to stay up all night and into Friday debugging. Wilson recalled watching the [[wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer]] on a small portable television while attempting to debug and re-solder the prototype. It was a success with the BBC, who awarded Acorn the contract. Along with Furber, Wilson was present backstage at the machine's first airing on television, in case any software fixes were required. Wilson later described the event as \"a unique moment in time when the public wanted to know how this stuff works and could be shown and taught how to program.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7307636.stm|title=BBC Micro ignites memories of revolution|work=BBC News|date=21 March 2008|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> The Proton became the [[BBC Micro]] and its BASIC evolved into [[BBC BASIC]], whose development was led by Wilson for the next 15 years.

Sir [[Tim Berners-Lee]] is one of their children.\n\n==Early life and education==\nShe was born in Birmingham, UK in 1924. From 1942\u20131944, she took a wartime compressed two-year degree course in mathematics at the [[University of Birmingham]]. She then worked for the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] until 1946 when she returned to take the third year of her degree. She worked at the [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]] in [[Canberra]], Australia from 1947 to 1951 when she joined [[Ferranti]] in Manchester as a computer programmer.\n\n==Work in Ferranti computer programming group==\nShe joined [[Ferranti]] in Manchester as a computer programmer, working in a group led by [[John Makepeace Bennett|John Bennett]].\n\nShe worked on both the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] and the [[Ferranti Mark 1#Ferranti Mark 1 star|Ferranti Mark 1*]] computers. Programs were written in [[machine code]]. Every bit had to be right; there was plenty of room for error.<ref>{{Citation | last = The University of Manchester | author-link = The University of Manchester | title = Programming on the Ferranti Mark 1 | year = 1999 | url = http://www.computer50.org/mark1/program.html | accessdate = 12 November 2009 }}</ref> The machines used serial 40-bit arithmetic (with a double length [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]).<ref>{{Citation | last = The University of Manchester | author-link = The University of Manchester | title = The Manchester Mark 1 | year = 1999 | url = http://www.computer50.org/mark1/MM1.html | accessdate = 12 November 2009 }}</ref> This meant that there were considerable difficulties in scaling the variables in the program to maintain adequate [[arithmetic precision]].<ref name = MC-KProgMk1P155>{{Cite journal | last = Campbell-Kelly | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Campbell-Kelly | title = Programming the Mark I: Early Programming Activity at the University of Manchester | journal = Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 155 | publisher = American Federation of Information Processing Societies | year = 1980 | doi=10.1109/mahc.1980.10018}}</ref>\n\nMembers of the programming team found it useful to commit to memory the following sequence of characters which represented the numbers 0 to 31 in the [[Baudot code|International Telegraph Alphabet No. 1 (Baudot)]] 5-bit binary code of the paper tape that was used for input and output. {{center|<tt>/E@A:SIU\u00bdDRJNFCKTZLWHYPQOBG\"MXV\u00a3</tt>}}\n\nAnother of the difficulties of programming related to the two-level store of the machines. There were eight [[Paging|pages]] of [[Williams tube|Williams cathode ray tube (CRT)]] [[random-access memory]] as fast [[Computer data storage#Primary storage|primary store]], and 512 pages of [[Computer data storage#Secondary storage|secondary store]] on a [[Drum memory|magnetic drum]]. Each page consisted of 32 40-bit [[Word (data type)|words]] which appeared as 64 20-bit lines on the CRTs. The programmer had to control all transfers between electronic and magnetic storage, and the transfers were slow and had to be reduced to a minimum. For programs dealing with large chunks of data, such as [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], partitioning into page-sized chunks could be troublesome.\n\nThe Mark 1 machine worked in integer arithmetic and, because of their background in [[radar]], the engineers had built the machine to display the lines on the CRTs with the most significant bit on the right. This could be argued as logically sensible, but was changed for the more conventional system for the Mark 1*, which also worked in fractions, not integers.<ref name = MC-KProgMk1P155/> Also, the Baudot teleprinter code was abandoned for one that was in the following order.<ref>{{Cite web | last = The University of Manchester | authorlink = The University of Manchester | title = The Ferranti Mark 1* | year = 2008 | url = http://www.digital60.org/birth/manchestercomputers/mark1/documents/fm1star.html#conv | accessdate = 12 November 2009 }}</ref> {{center|<tt>\u00f8\u00a3\u00bd0@:$ABCDEFGHIJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ</tt>}}\n\nProgram errors were difficult to find. Programmers could sit at the machine control desk watching the machine perform one instruction at a time to see where unintended events occurred. However, machine time became more and more valuable so John Bennett suggested that Mrs Berners-Lee write a diagnostic program to print out the contents of the accumulator and particular store lines at specific points in the program so that diagnosis could take place away from the machine. The challenge of her routine 'Stopandprint' was that it had to monitor the program under diagnosis without interfering with it, and there was very little space in the fast store.<ref>{{Citation | first = Bennett | last = J.

Conf., Toronto | pages = 81\u201387 | doi=10.1145/800259.809002}}</ref>\n\nProgram errors were one problem; machine errors were another. The computer frequently misread the binary digits. The engineers thought the mathematicians could compensate for this by programming arithmetic checks and the mathematicians would too readily assume that a wrong functioning was due to the machine when in fact it was due to a program error. There was inevitable friction between the mathematicians and the engineers. At the centre of this was a program that Mary Lee had written for inverting a matrix to solve 40 [[simultaneous equations]]\u2014a large number for those days. The long rows of data took too long for the machine to process without an error. On one occasion she took a dispute to [[Tom Kilburn]], who was second only to [[Frederic Calland Williams|Professor Freddy Williams]] on the engineering side. Tom Kilburn was polite but did not argue and she felt he was ignoring her complaint, but 50 years later when she asked him about this, he said that he had not argued \"because I knew you were right\".\n\n==Personal life==\nShe is married to [[Conway Berners-Lee]] and they met while working in the Ferranti team.
