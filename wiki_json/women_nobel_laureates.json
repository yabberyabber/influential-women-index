She created the first [[Hull House]]. In an era when presidents such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent<ref>John M. Murrin, Paul E. Johnson, and James M. McPherson, ''Liberty, Equality, Power'' (2008) p. 538; Eyal J. Naveh, ''Crown of Thorns'' (1992) p 122</ref> reformers of the [[Progressive Era]]. She helped  America to address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace. She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively. Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities. She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the [[American pragmatism|American pragmatist]] school of philosophy.<ref>Maurice Hamington, \"Jane Addams\" in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (2010) portrays her as a radical pragmatist and \"the first woman 'public philosopher' in United States history\".</ref> In 1889 she co-founded [[Hull House]], and in 1920 she was a co-founder for the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrating Women's History Month: The Fight for Women's Rights and the ACLU|url=http://acluva.org/11229/celebrating-womens-history-month-the-fight-for-womens-rights-and-the-aclu/|publisher=ACLU Virginia}}</ref> In 1931 she became the first American woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] and is recognized as the founder of the [[social work]] profession in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Jane Addams.jpg|thumb|Jane Addams as a young woman, undated studio portrait by Cox, Chicago]]\n\nBorn in [[Cedarville, Illinois]],<ref name=\"Cullen-DuPont2000\">{{cite book|author=Kathryn Cullen-DuPont|title=Encyclopedia of women's history in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&pg=PA374|year=2000|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4100-8|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> Jane Addams was the youngest of eight children born into a prosperous northern Illinois family of [[English-American]] descent which traced back to colonial New England; her father was politically prominent.

When she was four, she contracted [[tuberculosis]] of the spine, [[Pott disease|Potts's disease]], which caused a curvature in her spine and lifelong health problems. This made it complicated as a child to function with the other children, considering she had a limp and could not run as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jane Addams and Hull-House|url=http://www.teachspace.org/personal/research/addams/index.html|publisher=DeVry University|location=Her childhood|page=1|year=2001}}</ref> As a child, she thought she was \"ugly\" and later remembered wanting not to embarrass her father, when he was dressed in his Sunday best, by walking down the street with him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=36\u201337}}</ref>\n\nAddams adored her father when she was a child, as she made clear in the stories she told in her memoir, ''Twenty Years at Hull House'' (1910). [[John Huy Addams]] was an agricultural businessman with large timber, cattle, and agricultural holdings; flour and timber mills; and a woolen factory. He was the president of The Second National Bank of Freeport. He remarried in 1868, when Jane was eight years old. His second wife was Anna Hostetter Haldeman, the widow of a miller in Freeport.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=24, 45}}</ref>\n\nJohn Addams was a founding member of the Illinois [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], served as an [[Illinois Senate|Illinois State Senator]] (1855\u201370), and supported his friend [[Abraham Lincoln]] in his candidacies, for senator (1854) and the presidency (1860). John Addams kept a letter from Lincoln in his desk, and Jane Addams loved to look at it as a child.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=30\u201332, 424n64.}}</ref>\n\nIn her teens, Addams had big dreams\u2014to do something useful in the world. Long interested in the poor from her reading of [[Dickens]] and inspired by her mother's kindness to the Cedarville poor, she decided to become a doctor so that she could live and work among the poor. It was a vague idea, nurtured by literary fiction. She was a voracious reader.\n\nAddams's father encouraged her to pursue higher education but close to home. She was eager to attend the new college for women, [[Smith College]] in Massachusetts; but her father required her to attend nearby Rockford Female Seminary (now [[Rockford University]]), in [[Rockford, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Cullen-DuPont2000\"/> After graduating from Rockford in 1881,<ref name=\"Cullen-DuPont2000\"/> with a collegiate certificate and membership in [[Phi Beta Kappa]], she still hoped to attend Smith to earn a proper B.A. That summer, her father died unexpectedly from a sudden case of [[appendicitis]]. Each child inherited roughly $50,000 (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000|1881}}}} today).\n\nThat fall, Addams, her sister Alice, Alice's husband Harry, and their stepmother, Anna Haldeman Addams, moved to Philadelphia so that the three young people could pursue medical educations. Harry was already trained in medicine and did further studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Jane and Alice completed their first year of medical school at the Woman's Medical College of Philadelphia,<ref name=\"Cullen-DuPont2000\"/> but Jane's health problems, a spinal operation<ref name=\"Cullen-DuPont2000\"/> and a [[nervous breakdown]], prevented her from completing the degree. She was filled with sadness at her failure. Stepmother Anna was also ill, so the entire family canceled their plans to stay two years and returned to Cedarville.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=77\u201379, 109, 119\u2013120|isbn=0-226-44699-9}}</ref>\n\nThe following fall her brother-in-law/step brother Harry performed surgery on her back, to straighten it. He then advised that she not pursue studies but, instead, travel. In August 1883, she set off for a two-year tour of Europe with her stepmother, traveling some of the time with friends and family who joined them. Addams decided that she did not have to become a doctor to be able to help the poor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=124\u201325, 130\u201331, 138\u201339}}</ref>\n\nUpon her return home, in June 1887, she lived with her stepmother in Cedarville, and spent the winters with her in Baltimore. Addams, still filled with vague ambition, sank into depression, unsure of her future and feeling useless leading the conventional life expected of a well-to-do young woman. She wrote long letters to her friend from Rockford Seminary, [[Ellen Gates Starr]], mostly about Christianity and books but sometimes about her despair.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=139\u2013142 }}</ref>\n\n==Settlement house==\nMeanwhile, Jane Addams gathered inspiration from what she read. Fascinated by the early Christians and [[Tolstoy]]'s book ''[[s:My Religion|My Religion]]'', she was baptized a Christian in the Cedarville Presbyterian Church, in the summer of 1886.<ref>She was baptized a [[Presbyterian]]. Her certificate of baptism is from 1888, but she says that she joined the church slightly earlier: {{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|date=October 2003|page=451n46 |isbn=978-0-8122-3747-4}}</ref> Reading [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s ''Duties of Man'', she began to be inspired by the idea of [[democracy]] as a social ideal. Yet she felt confused about her role as a woman. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' made her question the social pressures on a woman to marry and devote her life to family.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=142\u2013145, 147\u201348}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1887, Addams read in a magazine about the new idea of starting a [[settlement house]]. She decided to visit the world's first, [[Toynbee Hall]], in [[London]]. She and several friends, including [[Ellen Gates Starr]], traveled in Europe from December 1887 through the summer of 1888. After watching a [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfight]] in [[Madrid]], fascinated by what she saw as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at the suffering of the horses and bulls. At first, Addams told no one about her dream to start a settlement house; but, she felt increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=152\u201355, 157}}</ref> Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr loved the idea and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=162\u201365}}</ref>\n\nAddams and another friend traveled to London without Starr, who was busy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=166, 175\u201376}}</ref> Visiting Toynbee Hall, Addams was enchanted. She described it as \"a community of University men who live there, have their recreation clubs and society all among the poor people, yet, in the same style in which they would live in their own circle. It is so free of 'professional doing good,' so unaffectedly sincere and so productive of good results in its classes and libraries seems perfectly ideal.\" Addams's dream of the classes mingling socially to mutual benefit, as they had in early Christian circles seemed embodied in the new type of institution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|page=169}}</ref>\n\nThe settlement house as  Addams discovered was a space within which unexpected cultural connections could be made and where the narrow boundaries of culture, class, and education could be expanded. They doubled up as community arts centers and social service facilities. They laid the foundations for American civil society, a neutral space within which different communities and ideologies could learn from each other and seek common grounds for collective action. The role of the settlement house was an \"unending effort to make culture and 'the issue of things' go together.\" The unending effort was the story of her own life, a struggle to reinvigorate her own culture by reconnecting with diversity and conflict of the immigrant communities in America's cities and with the necessities of social reform.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bilton|first=Chris|title=Jane Addams Pragmatism and Cultural Policy|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|date=2006|volume=12|issue=2|pages=135\u2013150<!--|accessdate=2014-04-16-->|doi=10.1080/10286630600813644}}</ref>\n\n==Hull House==\n{{Main|Hull House}}\n[[File:Jane Addams in a car.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Jane Addams, 1915]]\nIn 1889<ref>Colquhoun, Alan.

The run-down mansion had been built by Charles Hull in 1856 and needed repairs and upgrading. Addams at first paid for all of the capital expenses (repairing the roof of the porch, repainting the rooms, buying furniture) and most of the operating costs. However gifts from individuals supported the House beginning in its first year and Addams was able to reduce the proportion of her contributions, although the annual budget grew rapidly. A number of wealthy women became important long-term donors to the House, including Helen Culver, who managed her first cousin Charles Hull's estate, and who eventually allowed the contributors to use the house rent-free. Other contributors were [[Louise DeKoven Bowen]], Mary Rozet Smith, Mary Wilmarth, and others.<ref>{{cite web|last =Brown|first=Victoria Bissell|title=Jane Addams|work=American National Biography online|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=February 2000|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00004.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=195\u201396, 219, 224\u201325, 335, 378}}</ref>\n\nAddams and Starr were the first two occupants of the house, which would later become the residence of about 25 women. At its height,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laprogressive.com/election-reform-campaigns/first-wave-second-wave-and-then-came-sarah-palin/|title=First Wave -- Second Wave -- And Then Came Sarah Palin|author=Joseph Palermo|work=LA Progressive|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> Hull House was visited each week by some 2,000 people. The Hull House was a center for research, empirical analysis, study, and debate, as well as a pragmatic center for living in and establishing good relations with the neighborhood. Residents of Hull-house conducted investigations on housing, midwifery, fatigue, tuberculosis, typhoid, garbage collection, cocaine, and truancy. Its facilities included a night school for adults, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an [[art gallery]], a [[gym]], a girls' club, a bathhouse, a [[Bookbinding|book bindery]], a [[music school]], a drama group and a theater, apartments, a library, meeting rooms for discussion, clubs, an employment bureau, and a lunchroom.<ref name=\"Academic Search Premier\">{{cite journal|last=Lundblad|first=Karen Shafer|title=Jane Addams and Social Reform: A Role Model for the 1990s|journal=Social Work|date=Sep 1995|volume=40|issue=5}}</ref> Her adult night school was a forerunner of the [[continuing education]] classes offered by many universities today. In addition to making available social services and cultural events for the largely immigrant population of the neighborhood, Hull House afforded an opportunity for young social workers to acquire training. Eventually, Hull House became a 13-building settlement complex, which included a playground and a summer camp (known as [[Bowen Park (Waukegan)|Bowen Country Club]]).\n\nOne aspect of the Hull House that was very important to Jane Addams was the Art Program. The art program at Hull house allowed Addams to challenge the system of industrialized education, which \"fitted\" the individual to a specific job or position. She wanted the house to provide a space, time and tools to encourage people to think independently. She saw art as the key to unlocking the diversity of the city through collective interaction, mutual self-discovery, recreation and the imagination. Art was integral to her vision of community, disrupting fixed ideas and stimulating the diversity and interaction on which a healthy society depends, based on a continual rewriting of cultural identities through variation and [[interculturalism]].<ref name=\"Academic Search Premier\"/>\n\nWith funding from Edward Butler, Addams opened an art exhibition and studio space as one of the first additions to Hull House. On the first floor of the new addition there was a branch of the Chicago Public Library, and the second was the Butler Art Gallery, which featured recreations of famous artwork as well as the work of local artists. Studio space within the art gallery provided both Hull House residents and the entire community with the opportunity to take art classes or to come in and hone their craft whenever they liked. As Hull House grew, and the relationship with the neighborhood deepened, that opportunity became less of a comfort to the poor and more of an outlet of expression and exchange of different cultures and diverse communities. Art and culture was becoming a bigger and more important part of the lives of immigrants within the 19th ward, and soon children caught on to the trend. These working-class children were offered instruction in all forms and levels of art. Places such as the Butler Art Gallery or the Bowen Country Club often hosted these classes, but more informal lessons would often be taught outdoors. Addams, with the help of Ellen Gates Starr, founded the Chicago Public School Art Society (CPSAS) in response to the positive reaction the art classes for children caused. The CPSAS provided public schools with reproductions of world-renowned pieces of art, hired artists to teach children how to create art, and also took the students on field trips to Chicago's many art museums.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jane Addams|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/addamsj/|website=Internest Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Neighborhood===\nThe Hull House neighborhood was a mix of European ethnic groups that had immigrated to Chicago around the start of the 20th century. That mix was the ground where Hull House's inner social and philanthropic elitists tested their theories and challenged the establishment. The ethnic mix is recorded by the Bethlehem-Howard Neighborhood Center: \"[[Germans]] and [[Jews]] resided south of that inner core (south of Twelfth Street) [...] The [[Greeks|Greek]] delta formed by Harrison, [[Halsted Street|Halsted]], and Blue Island Streets served as a buffer to the [[Irish people|Irish]] residing to the north and the [[French Canadian|Canadian\u2013French]] to the northwest.\"<ref name=\"hhm\">Hull House Museum</ref> Italians resided within the inner core of the Hull House Neighborhood [...] from the river on the east end, on out to the western ends of what came to be known as [[Little Italy, Chicago|Little Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taylorstreetarchives.com |title=Stories from Chicago's Little Italy |publisher=Taylor Street Archives|accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> [[Greeks]] and Jews, along with the remnants of other immigrant groups, began their exodus from the neighborhood in the early 20th century. Only [[Italians]] continued as an intact and thriving community through the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], and well beyond the ultimate demise of Hull House proper in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.TaylorstreetArchives.com/|title=Taylor Street Archives: Florence Scala|work=Taylor Street Archives|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nHull House became America's best known settlement house. Addams used it to generate system-directed change, on the principle that to keep families safe, community and societal conditions had to be improved.<ref>Elshtain (2002). For some years previously Catholic nuns at Holy Family Parish had operated social welfare services in the same neighborhood. Hull House represented the first Protestant activity. See Ellen Skerrett, \"The Irish Of Chicago's Hull-House Neighborhood.\" ''Chicago History'' 2001 30(1): 22-63. {{ISSN|0272-8540}}</ref> The neighborhood was controlled by local political bosses.\n\n===Ethics===\nStarr and Addams developed three \"ethical principles\" for social settlements: \"to teach by example, to practice cooperation, and to practice social democracy, that is, egalitarian, or democratic, social relations across class lines.\"<ref>Knight (2005) p. 182</ref> Thus Hull House offered a comprehensive program of civic, cultural, recreational, and educational activities and attracted admiring visitors from all over the world, in including [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], a graduate student from Harvard University who later became prime minister of Canada. In the 1890s [[Julia Lathrop]], [[Florence Kelley]], and other residents of the house made it a world center of social reform activity. Hull House used the latest methodology (pioneering in statistical mapping) to study overcrowding, truancy, typhoid fever, cocaine, children's reading, newsboys, infant mortality, and midwifery. Starting with efforts to improve the immediate neighborhood, the Hull House group became involved in city- and statewide campaigns for better housing, improvements in public welfare, stricter child-labor laws, and protection of working women. Addams brought in prominent visitors from around the world, and had close links with leading Chicago intellectuals and philanthropists. In 1912, she helped start the new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] and supported the presidential campaign of [[Theodore Roosevelt]].\n\n\"Addams' philosophy combined feminist sensibilities with an unwavering commitment to social improvement through cooperative efforts. Although she sympathized with feminists, socialists, and pacifists, Addams refused to be labeled. This refusal was pragmatic rather than ideological.\"<ref name=WWU>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/addams-jane/| title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy website|language=}}</ref>\n\n===Emphasis on children===\nHull House stressed that the role of children in the Americanization process of new immigrants, and fostered the play movement and the research and service fields of leisure, youth, and human services. Addams argued in ''The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets'' (1909) that play and recreation programs are needed because cities are destroying the spirit of youth. Hull-House featured multiple programs in art and drama, kindergarten classes, boys' and girls' clubs, language classes, reading groups, college extension courses, along with public baths, a free-speech atmosphere, a gymnasium, a labor museum and playground. They were all designed to foster democratic cooperation and collective action and downplay individualism. She helped pass the first model tenement code and the first factory laws.\n\n===Documenting social illnesses===\nAddams and her colleagues documented the geography of typhoid fever and reported that poor workers bore the brunt of illness. She identified the political corruption and business avarice that caused the city bureaucracy to ignore health, sanitation, and building codes. Linking environmental justice and municipal reform, she eventually defeated the bosses and fostered a more equitable distribution of city services and modernized inspection practices.<ref>Platt (2000)</ref> Addams spoke of the \"undoubted powers of public recreation to bring together the classes of a community in the keeping them apart.\"<ref>Addams, 1909, p. 96</ref> Addams worked with the Chicago Board of Health and served as the first vice-president of the Playground Association of America.\n\n===Emphasis on prostitution===\nIn 1912 Addams published  \"A New Conscience and Ancient Evil\", about prostitution. This book was extremely popular because it was published in the traffic time of the [[Forced prostitution|white slave trade]]. Addams believed that prostitution was a result of kidnapping only.<ref>Victoria Bissell Brown.

However, over time, the focus changed from bringing art and culture to the neighborhood (as evidenced in the construction of the Butler Building) to responding to the needs of the community by providing childcare, educational opportunities, and large meeting spaces. Hull-House became more than a proving ground for the new generation of college-educated, professional women: it also became part of the community in which it was founded, and its development reveals a shared history.<ref>Kathryn Kish Sklar, et al. eds. \"How Did Changes In The Built Environment At Hull-House Reflect The Settlement's Interaction With Its Neighbors, 1889-1912?\" ''Women And Social Movements In The United States, 1600-2000'' 2004 8(4).</ref>\n\nAddams called on women\u2014especially middle class women with leisure and energy, as well as rich philanthropists\u2014to exercise their civic duty to become involved in municipal affairs as a matter of \"civic housekeeping.\"  Addams thereby enlarged the concept of civic duty to include roles for women beyond motherhood (which involved child rearing). Women's lives revolved around \"responsibility, care, and obligation,\" and this area represented the source of women's power.<ref>Elshtain (2002) p. 157</ref> This notion provided the foundation for the municipal or civil housekeeping role that Addams defined, and gave added weight to the women's suffrage movement that Addams supported. Addams argued that women, as opposed to men, were trained in the delicate matters of human welfare and needed to build upon their traditional roles of housekeeping to be civic housekeepers. Enlarged housekeeping duties involved reform efforts regarding poisonous sewage, impure milk (which often carried tuberculosis), smoke-laden air, and unsafe factory conditions. Addams led the \"garbage wars\"; in 1894 she became the first woman appointed as sanitary inspector of Chicago's 19th Ward. With the help of the Hull-House Women's Club, within a year over 1000 health department violations were reported to city counsel and garbage collection reduced death and disease.<ref>Eileen Maura McGurty, \"Trashy Women: Gender and the Politics of Garbage in Chicago, 1890-1917.\" ''Historical Geography'' 1998 26: 27-43. {{ISSN|1091-6458}}</ref>\n\nAddams had long discussions with philosopher [[John Dewey]] in which they redefined democracy in terms of pragmatism and civic activism, with an emphasis more on duty and less on rights.<ref>Knight (2005)</ref> The two leading perspectives that distinguished Addams and her coalition from the modernizers more concerned with [[Efficiency Movement|efficiency]] were the need to extend to social and economic life the democratic structures and practices that had been limited to the political sphere, as in Addams' programmatic support of trade unions; and second, their call for a new social ethic to supplant the individualist outlook as being no longer adequate in modern society.<ref>Scherman (1999)</ref>\n\nAddams' construction of womanhood involved daughterhood, sexuality, wifehood, and motherhood. In both of her autobiographical volumes, ''Twenty Years at Hull-House'' (1910) and ''The Second Twenty Years at Hull-House'' (1930), Addams's gender constructions parallel the Progressive-Era ideology she championed. In ''A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil'' (1912) she dissected the social pathology of sex slavery, prostitution and other sexual behaviors among working class women in American industrial centers during 1890-1910. Addams's autobiographical persona manifests her ideology and supports her popularized public activist persona as the \"Mother of Social Work,\" in the sense that she represents herself as a celibate matron, who served the suffering immigrant masses through Hull-House, as if they were her own children. Although not a mother herself, Addams became the \"mother to the nation,\" identified with motherhood in the sense of protective care of her people.<ref>Ostman (2004)</ref>\n\n==Teaching==\nAddams kept up her heavy schedule of public lectures around the country, especially at college campuses.<ref>Davis, ''American Heroine,'' p. 125</ref> In addition, she offered college courses through the Extension Division of the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>Addams is listed as lecturer in the Extension Division of the University of Chicago for several years (e.g. 1902, 1909, 1912). For a copy of the syllabus of one of her courses, see \"Survivals and Intimations in Social Ethics,\" Ely Papers, Wisconsin State Historical Society, 1900. Farrell noted the syllabus of another course in his footnotes; see ''Beloved Lady,'' p.83. This was titled \"A Syllabus of a Course of Twelve Lectures, Democracy and Social Ethics.\"</ref> She declined offers from the university to become directly affiliated with it, including an offer from [[Albion Small]], chair of the Department of Sociology, of a graduate faculty position. She declined in order to maintain her independent role outside of academia. Her goal was to teach adults not enrolled in formal academic institutions, because of their poverty and/or lack of credentials. Furthermore, she wanted no university controls over her political activism.<ref>Deegan, ''Jane Addams and the men of the Chicago school'' p 28.</ref>\n\nAddams was a charter member of the [[American Sociological Society]], founded in 1905. She gave papers to it in 1912, 1915, and 1919. She was the most prominent woman member during her lifetime.\n\n==Relationships==\nGenerally, Addams was close to a wide set of other women and was very good at eliciting their involvement from different classes in Hull House's programs. Nevertheless, throughout her life Addams did have significant romantic relationships with a few of these women, including [[Mary Rozet Smith]] and [[Ellen Starr]]. Her relationships offered her the time and energy to pursue her social work, while being supported emotionally and romantically. From her exclusively romantic relationships with women, she would most likely be described as a [[lesbian]] in contemporary terms, similar to many leading figures in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom of the time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Faderman|first1=Lilian|title=To Believe in Women: What Lesbians Have Done For America - A History|date=June 8, 2000|publisher=Mariner Books|page=155}}[https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=usIdCy63Y9sC&lpg=PA371&ots=IYH_-q2wK5&dq=jane%20addams%20lillian%20faderman&pg=PA121#v=onepage&q=jane%20addams%20lillian%20faderman&f=false Link to reference]</ref>\n\nHer first romantic partner was [[Ellen Starr]], with whom she founded [[Hull House]], and whom she met when both were students at Rockford Female Seminary.

(2001). ''A Full-Orbed Christianity: The Protestant Churches and Social Welfare in Canada, 1900\u20131940''. McGill-Queen's Press \u2013 MQUP, Jan 19, 2001 pg 107.</ref>\n\nAccording to Joslin (2004), \"The new humanism, as [Addams] interprets it comes from  a secular, and not a religious, pattern of belief\".<ref>Joslin, K. (2004). ''Jane Addams, a writer's life''. Illinois: University of Illinois press p. 170\n</ref>\n\nAccording to the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, \"Some social settlements were linked to religious institutions. Others, like Hull-House [co-founded by Addams], were secular.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/jaddams/hull/_learn/_aboutjane/aboutjane.html|title=Jane Addams Hull-House Museum|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, the co-founders of Toynbee Hall, Samuel and Henrietta Barnett, shared Addams's desire to bring Christianity back to its roots. Part of what was called the \"[[Social Gospel|social Christian]]\" movement, the Barnetts held a great interest in converting others to Christianity, but they believed that Christians should be more engaged with the world, and, in the words of one of the leaders of the movement in England, W.H. Fremantle, \"imbue all human relations with the spirit of Christ's self-renouncing love.\" Addams learned about social Christianity from them, soon considered herself one, and soon made friends among the leaders of the \"social Christian\" movement in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=173\u201374, 181}}</ref>\n\nJane Addams's religious faith was thus a central motive in co-founding Hull House with Starr. She sought to convert others to Christianity in greater numbers. A brief experiment in weekly prayer among the residents of the settlement house, requested by some of them, was highly religious and retained many converts to Christianity, to the delight of Addams and the other founder's helpers. Other settlements in both Great Britain and the United States later followed a religious approach and sought conversions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Louise W.|title=Citizen|pages=189\u201390, 461n30}}</ref>\n\nAddams's own religious beliefs were shaped by her wide reading and life experience.<ref>Curti, Merle. \"JANE ADDAMS ON HUMAN NATURE.\" Journal of the History of Ideas 22, no. 2 (April 1961): 240-253. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed July 2, 2010).</ref> By the time she had graduated from Rockford Seminary, she knew the Bible (especially the New Testament) thoroughly, having studied it throughout her young life, including in college courses. She had also been required to memorize a verse from the Bible every day at Rockford, and listen to a short sermon on the daily verse by the school's principal. Evidence of this deep familiarity with [[Scripture]] can be found throughout her later writings.\n\nWhile she remained a member of a Presbyterian church, Addams regularly attended a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Church and Ethical Society in Chicago. At one point, she was appointed \"interim lecturer\" at the Ethical Society. Addams also established a close relationship with members of the established Jewish community, notably with the rabbi of Chicago Sinai Congregation, [[Emil G. Hirsch]], and several of Sinai's congregants, among them Judge Julian Mack and Julius Rosenwald.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Peace movement===\n[[File:Jane Addams and Miss Elizabeth Burke.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Delegation to the Women's Suffrage Legislature Jane Addams (left) and Miss Elizabeth Burke of the University of Chicago, 1911]]\nIn 1898 Addams joined the [[American Anti-Imperialist League|Anti-Imperialist League]], in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the [[Philippines]].

This included meeting ten leaders in neutral countries as well as those at war to discuss mediation. This was the first significant international effort against the war. Addams, along with co-delegates [[Emily Balch]] and [[Alice Hamilton]], documented their experiences of this venture, published as a book ''Women at The Hague'' ([[University of Illinois]]).<ref>[http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/58fyh3nm9780252028885.html UI Press|Jane Addams, Emily G.

Her 1915 speech on pacifism at [[Carnegie Hall]] received negative coverage by newspapers such as the ''[[New York Times]]'', which branded her as unpatriotic.<ref>\"The revolt against war\"; Jane Addams' rhetorical challenge to the patriarchy\nSherry R.

Addams became an anti-war activist from 1899, as part of the anti-imperialist movement that followed the Spanish\u2013American War. Her book ''Newer Ideals of Peace'' (1907) reshaped the peace movement worldwide to include ideals of social justice. She recruited social justice reformers like Alice Hamilton, [[Lillian Wald]], [[Florence Kelley]], and Emily Greene Balch to join her in the new international women's peace movement after 1914. Addams's work came to fruition after [[World War I]], when major institutional bodies began to link peace with social justice and probe the underlying causes of war and conflict.<ref>Alonzo (2003)</ref>\n[[File:Jane Addams profile.jpg|thumb|left|Addams in 1914]]\nAddams damned war as a cataclysm that undermined human kindness, solidarity, civic friendship, and caused families across the world to struggle. In turn her views were denounced by patriotic groups and newspapers during [[World War I]] (1917\u201318). [[Oswald Garrison Villard]] came to her defense when she suggested that armies gave liquor to soldiers just before major ground attacks. \"Take the case of Jane Addams for one. With what abuse did not the [New York] ''Times'' cover her, one of the noblest of our women, because she told the simple truth that the Allied troops were often given liquor or drugs before charging across [[No Man's Land]].

''A Decade of Prohibition,'' The Survey, October 1, 1929, p 6.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{See also|History of social work}}\n\nHull House and the Peace Movement are widely recognized as the key tangible pillars of Addams' legacy. While her life focused on the development of individuals, her ideas continue to influence social, political and economic reform in the [[United States]] as well as internationally.\n\nWillard Motley, a resident artist of Hull House, extracting from Addams' central theory on symbolic interactionism, used the neighborhood and its people to write his 1948 best seller, [[Knock on Any Door]].<ref>Taylor Street Arhies</ref>\n\n[[File:Jane Addams 1940 Issue-10c.jpg|thumb|200px|Addams is honored in the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|'Famous Americans Series']], postal Issues of 1940]]\n\nAddams' role as reformer enabled her to petition the establishment at and alter the social and physical geography of her Chicago neighborhood. Although contemporary academic sociologists defined her engagement as \"social work,\" Addams' efforts differed significantly from activities typically labeled as \"social work\" during that time period. Before Addams' powerful influence on the profession, social work was largely informed by a \"friendly visitor\" model in which typically wealthy women of high public stature visited impoverished individuals and, through systematic assessment and intervention, aimed to improve the lives of the poor. Addams rejected the friendly visitor model in favor of a model of social reform/social theory-building, thereby introducing the now-central tenets of social justice and reform to the field of social work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssw.umich.edu/ongoing/fall2001/briefhistory.html|title=U-M-SSW: Ongoing Magazine|publisher=Ssw.umich.edu|accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>\n\nHull House enabled Addams to befriend and become a colleague to early members of the [[Chicago School of Sociology]]. Her influence, through her work in applied sociology, impacted their thoughts and their direction. In 1893, she co-authored the ''Hull-House Maps and Papers'' that came to define the interests and methodologies of the School. She worked with George H. Mead on social reform issues including promoting women's rights, ending child labor, and mediating during the 1910 Garment Workers' Strike.\n\nAddams worked with labor as well as other reform groups toward goals including the first juvenile-court law, tenement-house regulation, an eight-hour working day for women, factory inspection, and workers' compensation. She advocated research aimed at determining the causes of poverty and crime, and supported women's suffrage.

[[social democratic]] stateswoman, [[politician]], [[diplomat]] and [[author]] who serves as the [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|First and incumbent State Counsellor]] and Leader of the [[National League for Democracy]]. She is also the [[List of female foreign ministers|first female]] [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Burma)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] of [[Myanmar]] and the [[Office of the President of Burma|Minister of President's Office]] in [[President of Myanmar|President]] [[Htin Kyaw]]'s [[First Htin Kyaw's Cabinet|Cabinet]], and from 2012 to 2016 was a [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Kawhmu Township]].\n\nThe youngest daughter of [[Aung San]], [[Father of the Nation]] of modern-day Myanmar, and [[Khin Kyi]], Aung San Suu Kyi was born in [[Rangoon]], [[British Burma]]. After graduating from the [[University of Delhi]] in 1964 and the [[University of Oxford]] in 1968, she worked at the [[United Nations]] for three years. She married [[Michael Aris]] in 1972, and gave birth to two children. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the [[8888 Uprising|1988 Uprisings]], and became the General Secretary of the newly formed [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD). In the [[Burmese general election, 1990|1990 elections]], NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military]] refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had, however, already been detained under [[house arrest]] before the elections. She remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent [[political prisoner]]s.\n\nHer party boycotted the [[Myanmar general election, 2010|2010 elections]], resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]]. Aung San Suu Kyi became a [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the [[Burmese by-elections, 2012|2012 by-elections]]. In the [[Myanmar general election, 2015|2015 elections]], her party won a [[landslide victory]], taking 86% of the seats in the [[Assembly of the Union]] \u2014 well more than the 67 percent [[supermajority]] needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected [[President of Myanmar|President]] and [[Vice President of Myanmar|Second Vice President]] in the [[Presidential Electoral College]]. Although she was prohibited from becoming the President due to a clause in [[Constitution of Myanmar|the constitution]] \u2013 her late husband and children are foreign citizens \u2013 she assumed the newly created role of [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a role akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] or a [[head of government]].\n\nAung San Suu Kyi has gained international acclaim, having received many honours, including the: [[Rafto Prize]], [[Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought|Sakharov Prize]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding|Jawaharlal Nehru Award]], [[Order of Australia]], US [[Congressional Gold Medal]], and [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

Balch combined an academic career at [[Wellesley College]] with a long-standing interest in social issues such as poverty, child labor and immigration, as well as settlement work to uplift poor immigrants and reduce juvenile delinquency.   She moved into the peace movement at the start of the World War I in 1914, and began collaborating with [[Jane Addams]] of Chicago.  She became a central leader of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF) based in Switzerland, for which she won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1946.\n\n==Life==\nBorn to a prominent Yankee family near Boston, her father was a lawyer. She graduated Bryn Mawr College in 1889, reading widely in the classics and languages, and focusing on economics. She did graduate work in Paris and published her research as ''Public Assistance of the Poor in France'' (1893). She did settlement housework in Boston, but decided on an academic career. She then studied at Harvard, University Chicago, and the University of Berlin, and began teaching at Wellesley College in 1896. She focused on immigration, consumption, and the economic roles of women. She served on numerous state commissions, such as the first commission on minimum wages for women. She was a leader of the [[Women's Trade Union League]], which supported women who belonged to labor unions. She published a major sociological study of ''Our Slavic Fellow Citizens'' in 1910.  She was a longtime pacifist, and was a participant in Henry Ford's International Committee on Mediation.  When the United States entered the war, she became a political activist opposing conscription in espionage legislation, and supporting the civil liberties of conscientious objectors. She collaborated with Jane Addams in the Women's Peace party, and numerous other groups.\n\nIn a letter to the president of Wellesley, she wrote we should follow \"the ways of Jesus\". Her spiritual thoughts were that American economy was  \"far from being in harmony with the principles of Jesus which we profess.\" <ref>Mercedes Moritz Randall, ''Improper Bostonian: Emily Greene Balch, Nobel Peace Laureate, 1946'' (1964) pp. 364; 378</ref>  Wellesley College terminated her contract in 1919. Balch served as an editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', a well-known magazine of political commentary. Balch converted from [[Unitarianism]] and became a [[Quaker]] in 1921. She stated, \"Religion seems to me one of the most interesting things in life, one of the most puzzling, richest and thrilling fields of human thought and speculation... religious experience and thought need also a light a day and sunshine and a companionable sharing with others of which it seems to me there is generally too little... The Quaker worship at its best seems to me give opportunities for this sort of sharing without profanation.\"<ref>Randall, ''Improper Bostonian''  p. 60</ref>\n\nHer major achievements were just beginning, as she became an American leader of the international peace movement.  She won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1946 for her work with the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF).  In 1919, Balch played a central role in the International Congress of Women.  It changed its name to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and was based in [[Geneva]].  She was hired by the League as its first international Secretary-Treasurer, administering the organization's activities. She helped set up summer schools on peace education, and created new branches in over 50 countries.  She cooperated with the newly established [[League of Nations]] regarding drug control, aviation, refugees, and disarmament.  In World War II, she favored Allied victory and did not criticize the war effort, but did support the rights of [[conscientious objector]]s.<ref>Suzanne Niemeyer, editor, ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography: vol. IV'' (1990) pp 1806\u20131814</ref>\n\nBalch never married. She died the day after her 94th birthday.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of female Nobel laureates]]\n* [[List of peace activists]]\n* [[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]]\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.nobel.se/peace/laureates/1946/ Nobel Committee information on 1946 Peace Prize laureates]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=nyncAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA182&dq=emily+greene+balch+biography&hl=en&ei=FlIGTa6IB4L78AbIwaXnAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q&f=false Emily Greene Balch, ''Public Assistance of the Poor in France''], Vol. 8, Nos. 4 & 5, ''Publications of the American Economic Association.''\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=F4bpAAAAMAAJ  Emily Greene Balch, \"A Study of Conditions of City Life: with Special Reference to Boston, A Bibliography\"], 1903, 13 pages\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzgSAAAAIAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=emily+greene+balch+biography&hl=en&ei=u1AGTauwLMP68AbBqLTgDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Our Slavic Fellow Citizens''] By Emily Greene Balch, 1910, 536 pages.\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=aBpBAAAAYAAJ  ''Women at the Hague: the International Congress of Women and its Results''], By Jane Addams, Emily Greene Balch, and [[Alice Hamilton]]. 171 pages, New York: MacMillan, 1915.\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=di4MAAAAYAAJ  ''Approaches to the Great Settlement''] By Emily Greene Balch, Pauline Knickerbocker Angell, 351 pages, published 1918.\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book|last=Alonso |first=Harriet Hyman\n|title=Peace As a Women's Issue: A History of the U.S. Movement for World Peace and Women's Rights |publisher =Syracuse University Press |date=1993|ISBN = 0815602693|OCLC=25508750}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Foster |first=Catherine\n|title=Women for All Seasons: The Story of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom |publisher =University of Georgia Press |date=1989|ISBN = 0820310921|OCLC=18051898}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Gwinn |first=Kristen E.|title=Emily Greene Balch: The Long Road to Internationalism |publisher =University of Illinois Press |date=2010|ISBN =9780252090158 |OCLC=702844599}} \n*{{Cite book|last=Nichols |first=Christopher McKnight\n|title=Promise and Peril: America at the Dawn of a Global Age |publisher =Harvard University Press |date=2011|ISBN = 9780674061187|OCLC=754841336}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Randall |first=Mercedes M. \n|title=Improper Bostonian: Emily Greene Balch|publisher =Twayne Publishers |date=1964|ISBN = |OCLC=779059266}}, scholarly biography\n* Solomon, Barbara Miller. \"Balch, Emily Greene,\" in Barbara Sicherman and Carol Hurd Green, eds.

She received her PhD in 1975 and interned at the U.S. National Institutes of Health before returning to the Pasteur Institute. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi's research quickly turned to a particular group of viruses, the retroviruses. Her knowledge in this field led her to discover [[HIV]] in 1983. This discovery revealed an urgent need for diagnostic tests to aid in controlling the spread of the disease. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi started her own laboratory at the Pasteur Institute in 1988. \n\nAmong Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi's many recent research contributions are studies of various aspects of the adaptive immune response to viral infection,<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Petitjean | first1 = G.

After reading Sol Snyder's group research paper at [[Johns Hopkins University]], Linda Buck set out to map the olfactory process at the molecular level, tracing the travel of odors through the cells of the nose to the brain. Buck and Axel worked with rat genes in their research and identified a family of genes that code for more than 100 odor receptors and published these findings in 1991.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/buc0bio-1|title=Linda Buck Biography -- Academy of Achievement|website=www.achievement.org|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref> Later that year, Buck became an assistant professor in the [[Neurobiology]] Department at [[Harvard Medical School]] where she expanded her knowledge of the nervous system and established her own lab.<ref>{{cite web |title=Linda B. Buck - Autobiography |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2004/buck-autobio.html |publisher=NobelPrize.org |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> After finding how odors are detected by the nose, Buck published her findings in 1993 on how the inputs from different odor receptors are organized in the nose.<ref name=\":1\" /> Essentially, her primary research interest is on how [[pheromone]]s and [[odor]]s are detected in the nose and interpreted in the brain. She is a Full Member of the Basic Sciences Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, an Affiliate Professor of [[Physiology]] and [[Biophysics]] at the University of Washington, Seattle and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\n== Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (2004) ==\nIn her landmark paper published in 1991 with Richard Axel, Linda Buck discovered how hundreds of genes code for the odorant sensors located in the olfactory neurons of our noses.<ref name=\"Faces\" /> Each receptor is a protein that changes when an odor attaches to the receptor, causing an electrical signal to be sent to the brain.<ref name=\":0\" /> Differences between odorant sensors mean that certain odors cause a signal to be released from a certain receptor.<ref name=\":0\" /> We are then able to interpret varying signals from our receptors as specific scents.<ref name=\":0\" /> To do this, Buck and Axel [[cloning|cloned]] olfactory receptors, showing that they belong to the family of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s.  By analyzing [[rat]] [[DNA]], they estimated that there were approximately one thousand different [[gene]]s for olfactory receptors in the [[mammal]]ian [[genome]].  This research opened the door to the [[genetics|genetic]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] analysis of the mechanisms of [[olfaction]]. In their later work, Buck and Axel have shown that each [[olfactory receptor neuron]] remarkably only expresses one kind of olfactory receptor protein and that the input from all neurons expressing the same receptor is collected by a single dedicated [[glomerulus (olfaction)|glomerulus]] of the [[olfactory bulb]].\n\n==Awards and Honors==\n[[File:Dr Linda Buck ForMemRS.jpg|thumb|Linda Buck in 2015, portrait via the Royal Society]]\nBuck was awarded the Takasago Award for Research in Olfaction (1992), Unilever Science Award (1996), R.H.

As the daughter of [[missionaries]], Buck spent most of her life before 1934 in [[Zhenjiang]], [[China]]. Her novel ''[[The Good Earth]]'' was the best-selling fiction book in the United States in 1931 and 1932 and won the [[Pulitzer Prize for the Novel|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1932.

When Pearl was five months old, the family arrived in China, first in [[Huai'an]] and then in 1896 moved to [[Zhenjiang]] (then often known as Jingjiang or, in the [[Postal romanization|postal]], Tsingkiang), near Nanking.<ref>{{citation|first=David |last=Shavit|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1990|isbn=0-313-26788-X\n|title=The United States in Asia: a historical dictionary|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IWdZTaJdc6UC\n|page=480}} (Entry for \"Sydenstricker, Absalom\")</ref>\n\nOf her siblings who survived into adulthood, Edgar Sydenstricker (1881\u20131936) had a distinguished career in epidemiology as an official with the [[Milbank Quarterly|Milbank Memorial Fund]]<ref>{{cite journal |title=Edgar Sydenstricker |first1=Willford I. |last1=King |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=31 |issue=194 |date=June 1936 |pages=411\u20134 |jstor=2278574 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1936.10503344}}</ref> and Grace Sydenstricker Yaukey (1899\u20131994) was a writer who wrote young adult books and books about Asia under the pen name Cornelia Spencer.\n\n[[File:Coolieresting.jpg|thumb|Chinese man in Zhenjiang, c. 1900]]\n\nShe recalled in her memoir that she lived in \"several worlds\", one a \"small, white, clean Presbyterian world of my parents\", and the other the \"big, loving merry not-too-clean Chinese world\", and there was no communication between them.<ref>Pearl S. Buck, ''My Several Worlds: A Personal Record'' (New York: John Day, 1954)p. 10.</ref> The [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer Uprising]] greatly affected the family; their Chinese friends deserted them, and Western visitors decreased. Her father, convinced that no Chinese could wish him harm, stayed behind as the rest of the family went to Shanghai for safety. A few years later, Pearl was enrolled in Miss Jewell's School there, and was dismayed at the racist attitudes of the other students, few of whom could speak any Chinese. Both of her parents felt strongly that Chinese were their equals (they forbade the use of the word ''heathen''), and she was raised in a bilingual environment, tutored in English by her mother, in the local dialect by her Chinese playmates, and in classical Chinese by a Chinese scholar named Mr. Kung. She also read voraciously, especially, in spite of her father's disapproval, the novels of [[Charles Dickens]], which she later said she read through once a year for the rest of her life.<ref>Peter Conn, ''Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography'', Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1996) 9, 19\u201323 ISBN 0521560802.</ref>\n\nIn 1911, Pearl left China to attend [[Randolph-Macon Woman's College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], [[Virginia]], in the United States, graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1914 and a member of [[Kappa Delta]] Sorority. Although she had not intended to return to China, much less become a missionary, she quickly applied to the Presbyterian Board when her father wrote that her mother was seriously ill. From 1914 to 1932, she served as a Presbyterian missionary, but her views later became highly controversial during the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]], leading to her resignation.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70\u201382\">Conn, ''Pearl S. Buck'', 70\u201382.</ref>\n\n==Career in China==\n\nIn 1914, Pearl returned to China. She married an agricultural economist missionary, [[John Lossing Buck]], on May 13, 1917, and they moved to [[Suzhou, Anhui|Suzhou, Anhui Province]], a small town on the [[Huai River]] (not to be confused with the better-known Suzhou in Jiangsu Province). This region she describes in her books ''The Good Earth'' and ''Sons''.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1933, the Bucks made their home in Nanjing, on the campus of the [[University of Nanking]], where they both had teaching positions. She taught [[English literature]] at the private, church-run [[University of Nanking]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Gould Hunter Thomas|\ntitle=''An American in China, 1936-1939: A Memoir''| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fL9PAAACAAJ|date=1 January 2004| chapter=Nanking | chapterurl=http://www.willysthomas.net/Nanking.htm | publisher=Greatrix Press|isbn=978-0-9758800-0-5}}</ref> [[Ginling College]] and at the [[Nanjing University|National Central University]]. In 1920, the Bucks had a daughter, Carol, afflicted with [[phenylketonuria]]. In 1921, Buck's mother died of a tropical disease, [[Tropical sprue|sprue]], and shortly afterward her father moved in. In 1924, they left China for John Buck's year of sabbatical and returned to the United States for a short time, during which Pearl Buck earned her [[Master of Arts|master's]] degree from [[Cornell University]]. In 1925, the Bucks adopted Janice (later surnamed Walsh). That autumn, they returned to China.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70\u201382\"/>\n\nThe tragedies and dislocations that Buck suffered in the 1920s reached a climax in March 1927, during the \"[[Nanking Incident]]\". In a confused battle involving elements of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Nationalist troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords, several Westerners were murdered. Since her father Absalom insisted, as he had in 1900 in the face of the Boxers, the family decided to stay in Nanjing until the battle reached the city. When violence broke out, a poor Chinese family invited them to hide in their hut while the family house was looted. The family spent a day terrified and in hiding, after which they were rescued by American gunboats. They traveled to Shanghai and then sailed to Japan, where they stayed for a year, after which they moved back to Nanjing. Pearl later said that this year in Japan showed her that not all Japanese were militarists. When she returned from Japan in late 1927, Pearl devoted herself in earnest to the vocation of writing. Friendly relations with prominent Chinese writers of the time, such as [[Xu Zhimo]] and [[Lin Yutang]], encouraged her to think of herself as a professional writer. She wanted to fulfill the ambitions denied to her mother, but she also needed money to support herself if she left her marriage, which had become increasingly lonely, and since the mission board could not provide it, she also needed money for Carol\u2019s specialized care. Pearl went once more to the States in 1929 to find long-term care for Carol, and while there, Richard Walsh, editor at [[John Day Company|John Day publishers]] in New York, accepted her novel ''[[East Wind: West Wind]]''. She and Richard began a relationship that would result in marriage and many years of professional teamwork. Back in Nanking, she retreated every morning to the attic of her university bungalow and within the year completed the manuscript for ''[[The Good Earth]]''.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 345\">Conn, ''Pearl S.

Her talk was titled \u201cIs There a Case for the Foreign Missionary?\u201d and her answer was a barely qualified \u201cno\u201d. She told her American audience that she welcomed Chinese to share her Christian faith, but argued that China did not need an institutional church dominated by missionaries who were too often ignorant of China and arrogant in their attempts to control it.

He offered her advice and affection which, her biographer concludes, \"helped make Pearl's prodigious activity possible\". The couple lived in Pennsylvania until his death in 1960.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S.

If they are reading their magazines by the million, then I want my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few.\"<ref>Nobel Lecture (1938) [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1938/buck-lecture.html# The Chinese Novel]</ref>\n\n==Humanitarian efforts and later life==\nBuck was highly committed to a range of issues that were largely ignored by her generation. Many of her life experiences and political views are described in her novels, [[short stories]], [[fiction]], [[child]]ren's stories, and the biographies of her parents entitled ''[[Fighting Angel]]'' (on Absalom) and ''[[The Exile (1936 book)|The Exile]]'' (on Carrie). She wrote on a diverse variety of topics including [[women's rights]], [[Asia]]n cultures, [[immigration]], adoption, missionary work, war and violence.\n\nIn 1949, outraged that existing [[adoption]] services considered Asian and [[multiracial|mixed-race]] children unadoptable, Buck co-founded Welcome House, Inc.,<ref>{{Cite web| title = Welcome House: A Historical Perspective| work = Pearl S. Buck International| accessdate = 2015-04-06| url = http://www.psbi.org/page.aspx?pid=384}}</ref> the first international, interracial adoption agency, along with [[James A. Michener]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] and his second wife [[Dorothy Hammerstein]]. In nearly five decades of work, Welcome House has placed over five thousand children. In 1964, to support kids who were not eligible for adoption, Buck established the Pearl S. Buck Foundation (now called Pearl S. Buck International) to \"address poverty and discrimination faced by children in Asian countries\". In 1964, she opened the Opportunity Center and Orphanage in South Korea, and later offices were opened in Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. When establishing Opportunity House, Buck said, \"The purpose...is to publicize and eliminate injustices and prejudices suffered by children, who, because of their birth, are not permitted to enjoy the educational, social, economic and civil privileges normally accorded to children.\"<ref>Pearl S.

She renewed a warm relation with [[William Ernest Hocking]], who died in 1963. Buck then withdrew from many of her old friends and quarreled with others. In the late 1960s, Buck toured West Virginia to raise money to preserve her family farm in [[Hillsboro, WV|Hillsboro]], [[West Virginia]]. Today [[The Pearl S.

She soon depended on him for all her daily routines, and placed him in control of Welcome House and the Pearl S. Buck Foundation.

Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe, the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922. Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research, collaborating in the laboratory with Carl. She published research findings coauthored  with her husband, as well as publishing singly. Unlike her husband, she had difficulty securing research positions, and the ones she obtained provided meager pay. Her husband insisted on continuing their collaboration, though he was discouraged from doing so by the institutions that employed him.\n\nWith her husband Carl and Argentine physiologist [[Bernardo Houssay]], Gerty Cori received the Nobel Prize  in 1947 for the discovery of the mechanism by which [[glycogen]]\u2014a derivative of [[glucose]]\u2014is broken down in muscle tissue  into [[lactic acid]] and then resynthesized in the body and stored as a source of energy (known as the [[Cori cycle]]). They also identified the important catalyzing compound, the [[Cori ester]].

Her father, Otto Radnitz, was a chemist who became manager of sugar refineries after inventing a successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of [[Franz Kafka]], was a culturally sophisticated woman.<ref name=\"ACS Landmarks\"/> Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a [[Lyceum]] for girls, and at the age of 16 she decided she wanted to be a medical doctor.

Over the course of a year, she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years of math.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHer uncle, a professor of pediatrics, encouraged her to attend medical school, so she studied for and passed the University entrance examination. She was admitted to the medical school of the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t]] in Prague in 1914, which was unusual for a woman to achieve at that time. While studying she met [[Carl Cori]] who was immediately attracted to her charm, vitality, sense of humor and her love of the outdoors and mountain climbing.<ref name=\"Larner\" /> Gerty and Carl had both entered medical school at eighteen and both graduated in 1920.

[[Tadeusz Estreicher]], in the 1938 ''[[Polski s\u0142ownik biograficzny]]'' entry, writes that, while many sources state she earned a degree in mathematics, this is incorrect, and that her second degree was in chemistry.<ref name=\"psb111\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"How the Curie Came to Be\">{{cite web | author=Paul W.

She started writing at a very young age, inspired by the Sardinian peasants and their struggles.\n\nThe first novel she wrote and published was ''Fiori di Sardegna'' (Flowers of Sardinia). This novel was published in 1892. She first published some pieces in the fashion magazine ''L'ultima moda'' when it still published works in prose and poetry. ''Nell'azzurro'', published by Trevisani in 1890, might be considered her first work. Her family was not supportive of her desire to write, as it went against the social norms of the patriarchal system.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\">Amoia, Alba Della Fazia. 20th-century Italian Women Writers: The Feminine Experience. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1996. Print.</ref> Possibly due to this, she published a novel, ''Stella d\u2019Oriente'', under the pseudonym Ilia di Saint-Ismael.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\"/>  Her works seemed to focus on portraying harsh realities and difficult lifestyles, combining imaginary and autobiographical elements.  Her novels tend to criticize social values and moral norms rather than the people who are victims of such circumstances.\n\nStill between prose and poetry are, among the first works, ''Paesaggi sardi'', published by Speirani in 1896. In 1900, after having married Palmiro Madesani, a functionary of the Ministry of War whom she met in [[Cagliari]] in October 1899, the writer moved to Rome and after the publication of ''Anime oneste'' in 1895 and of ''Il vecchio della montagna'' in 1900, plus the collaboration with magazines ''La Sardegna'', ''Piccola rivista'' and ''Nuova Antologia'', her work began to gain critical interest. She had two sons and lived a quiet life occupied by her writing.<ref name=\"russell1994\">Migiel, Marilyn. \"Grazia Deledda.\" Italian Women Writers: A Bio-bibliographical Sourcebook. By Rinaldina Russell. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1994. 111-117. Print.</ref> She was a very prolific writer publishing, on average, a novel a year.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/>\n\nIn 1903 she published her first real success, ''Elias Portolu'' that confirmed her as a writer and started her work as a successful [[writer of novels]] and theatrical works:'' Cenere'' (1904), ''[[L'edera (novel)|L'edera]]'' (1908), ''Sino al confine'' (1911), ''Colombi e sparvieri'' (1912), ''Canne al vento'' (1913) -her most well known book in Italy-, ''L'incendio nell'oliveto'' (1918), ''Il Dio dei venti'' (1922).\n\n''[[Cenere]]'' was the inspiration for a silent movie with the famous Italian actress [[Eleonora Duse]]. It was the only time Duse appeared in film.\n\nDeledda received the Nobel Prize in 1926 in Literature after she had been nominated by [[Henrik Sch\u00fcck]], member of the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref>http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=7586</ref>  Her response in winning the prize was Gi\u00e0! (Look at that!) Deledda was very protective of her daily writing routine. Her schedule was exactly the same seven days a week: a late breakfast, a few hours of reading, lunch followed by a nap and then, clearly, ending the day with a few hours of writing.  \nDeledda happened to receive the Nobel Prize almost exactly a year after Benito Mussolini dropped the charade of constitutional rule of the favor of Fascism.  Mussolini himself wished to give Grazia a portrait of himself, and he signed it with \u201cprofound admiration.\u201d\nWith this string of fame, came a slew of journalists and notable photographers whom she allowed into her home to learn more about her.  Her beloved pet crow, Checcha was irritated by all the commotion with people coming in and out. \u201cIf Checcha has had enough, so have I,\u201d Deledda was quoted as saying.\n\nDeledda continued to write even as she grew older and weaker. \"La Casa del Poeta\" and \"Sole d'Estate\" are two of the collections of short stories she wrote during this time. She showcased her optimistic view of life even as she suffered from painful illnesses. She believed that life was beautiful and serene, unaltered by personal suffering; man and nature are reconciled in order to overcome physical and spiritual hardships. Her later works show how mankind and faith in God are beautiful things.\n\nShe died in Rome at the age of 64 of breast cancer. ''La chiesa della solitudine'' (1936), Deledda's last novel, is a semi-autobiographical depiction of a young Italian woman coming to terms with her breast cancer. A completed manuscript of the novel \"[[Cosima (Grazia Deledda novel)|Cosima]]\" (1937) was discovered after her death and published posthumously.<ref name=\"hallengren1926\"/>\n\nHer work has been highly regarded by [[Luigi Capuana]] and [[Giovanni Verga]] plus some younger writers such as [[Enrico Thovez]], [[Pietro Pancrazi]], [[Renato Serra]], and later until today by Sardinian writers such as [[Sergio Atzeni]], [[Giulio Angioni]], [[Salvatore Mannuzzu]], starters of the so-called [[Sardinian Literary Spring]].\n\n==Work==\nThe life, customs, and traditions of the [[Sardinian people]] are prominent in her writing.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/> She relies heavily on geographical description and details and her work is most often concerned with transgressions.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/> Many of her characters are social outcasts that struggle in silence and isolation.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/> Deledda's whole work is based on strong facts of love, [[pain]] and death upon which rests the feeling of [[sin]] and of an inevitable fatality.\n\nIn her works we can recognize the influence of the [[verism]] of [[Giovanni Verga]] and, sometimes, also that of the [[decadentism]] by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\nIn Deledda's novels there is always a strong connection between places and people, feelings and [[social environment|environment]]. The environment depicted is mostly that one harsh of native [[Sardinia]], but it is not depicted according to regional veristic schemes neither according to the otherworldly vision by D'Annunzio, but relived through the myth.\n\nDeledda has not gained much recognition as a feminist writer potentially due to her themes of women\u2019s pain and suffering as opposed to women\u2019s autonomy.<ref name=\"russell1994\"/>\n\n===Complete list of works===\nBelow is a complete list of Deledda's works:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/textdbs/iww/editionidx.pl?edition_auth_codes=A0014|title=IWW Results|work=uchicago.edu}}</ref>\n{{colbegin|cols=3}}\n* ''[[Stella d'Oriente]]'' (1890)\n* ''[[Nell'azzuro]]'' (1890)\n* ''[[Fior di Sardegna]]'' (1891)\n* ''[[Racconti sardi]]'' (1894)\n* ''[[Tradizioni popolari di Nuoro in Sardegna]]'' (1894)\n* ''[[La via del male]]'' (1896)\n* ''[[Anime oneste]]'' (1895)\n* ''[[Paesaggi sardi]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[La tentazioni]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Il tesoro]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[L'ospite (novel)|L'ospite]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[La giustizia]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Nostra Signora del buon consiglio: leggenda sarda]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Le disgrazie che pu\u00f2 causare il denaro]]'' (1899)\n* ''[[Il Vecchio della montagna]]'' (1900)\n* ''Dopo il divorzio'' (1902; English translation: ''[[After the divorce]]'', 1995)\n* ''[[La regina delle tenebre]]'' (1902)\n* ''[[Elias Portolu]]'' (1900)\n* ''[[Cenere (novel)|Cenere]]'' (1904; English translation: ''[[Ashes (novel)|Ashes]]'', 1908)\n* ''[[Odio Vince]]'' (1904)\n* ''[[Nostalgie (novel)|Nostalgie]]'' (1905)\n* ''[[I giuochi della vita]]'' (1905)\n* ''[[L'ombra del passato]]'' (1907)\n* ''[[Amori moderni]]'' (1907)\n* ''[[L'edera-romanzo (novel)|L'edera]]'' (1908)\n* ''[[Il nonno]]'' (1908)\n* ''[[Il nostro padrone]]'' (1910)\n* ''[[Sino al confine]]'' (1910)\n* ''[[Nel deserto]]'' (1911)\n* ''[[L'edera: dramma in tre atti]]'' (1912)\n* ''[[Colombi e sparvieri]]'' (1912)\n* ''[[Chiaroscuro (novel)|Chiaroscuro]]'' (1912)\n* ''[[Canne al vento]]'' (1913)\n* ''[[Le colpe altrui]]'' (1914)\n* ''[[Marianna Sirca]]'' (1915)\n* ''[[Il fanciullo nascosto]]'' (1915)\n* ''[[L'incendio nell'oliveto]]'' (1918)\n* ''[[Il ritorno del figlio]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[Naufraghi in porto]]'' (1920)\n* ''La madre'' (1920; English translation: ''[[The Woman and the Priest]]'', 1922; English translation: ''[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/deledda/mother/mother.html The Mother]'', by [[D.

Her father, Mohammad Ali Ebadi, was the city's chief [[notary public]] and a professor of [[commercial law]]. Her family moved to [[Tehran]] in 1948.\n\nShe was admitted to the law department of the [[University of Tehran]] in 1965 and in 1969, upon graduation, passed the qualification exams to become a judge. After a six-month [[internship]] period, she officially became a judge in March 1969. She continued her studies in University of Tehran in the meantime to pursue a doctorate's degree in law in 1971. In 1975, she became the first woman president of the Tehran city court, and also the first ever woman judge in Iran.<ref name=\"BBC Profile\">{{cite news|title=Profile: Shirin Ebadi|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3181992.stm|work=article|publisher=BBC News|date=27 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Iranian revolution]] in 1979, conservative [[cleric]]s insisted that Islam prohibits women from becoming judges and Ebadi was demoted to a secretarial position at the branch where she had previously presided. She and other female judges protested and were assigned to the slightly higher position of \"law expert.\" She eventually requested early retirement as the situation remained unchanged.\n\nAs her applications were repeatedly rejected, Ebadi was not able to practice as a lawyer until 1993, while she already had a [[law office]] permit. She used this free time to write books and many articles in Iranian [[periodical]]s.<ref name=\"Kinnear2011\" />\n\n==Ebadi as a lawyer==\n[[File:Shirinebadi001.jpg|thumb|Shirin Ebadi at WSIS press conference]]\nEbadi now{{fact|date=June 2016}} lectures law at the University of Tehran and is a campaigner for strengthening the legal status of children and women, the latter of which played a key role in the May 1997 landslide presidential election of the reformist [[Mohammad Khatami]].\n\nAs a lawyer, she is known for taking up ''[[pro bono]]'' cases of dissident figures who have fallen foul of the judiciary. She has represented the family of [[Dariush Forouhar]], a dissident intellectual and politician who was found stabbed to death at his home. His wife, [[Parvaneh Forouhar|Parvaneh Eskandari]], was also killed at the same time.\n\nThe couple were among several dissidents who died in [[Chain murders of Iran|a spate of grisly murders]] that terrorized Iran's intellectual community. Suspicion fell on extremist hard-liners determined to put a stop to the more liberal climate fostered by [[President Khatami]], who championed freedom of speech. The murders were found to be committed by a team of the employees of the [[Iranian Ministry of Intelligence]], whose head, [[Saeed Emami]], allegedly committed suicide in jail before being brought to court.\n\nEbadi also represented the family of [[Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad]], who was killed in the [[Iran student protests, July 1999|Iranian student protests]] in July 1999. In 2000 Ebadi was accused of manipulating the videotaped confession of [[Amir Farshad Ebrahimi]], a former member of the [[Ansar-e Hezbollah]]. Ebrahimi confessed his involvement in attacks made by the organization on the orders of high-level conservative authorities, which have included the killing of [[Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad]]  and attacks against members of President Khatami's cabinet. Ebadi claimed that she had only videotaped Amir Farshad Ebrahimi's confessions in order to present them to the court. This case was named \"Tape makers\" by hardliners who questioned the credibility of his videotaped deposition as well as his motives. Ebadi and Rohami were sentenced to five years in jail and suspension of their law licenses for sending Ebrahimi's videotaped deposition to Islamic President Khatami and the head of the [[Judicial system of Iran|Islamic judiciary]]. The sentences were later vacated by the Islamic judiciary's supreme court, but they did not forgive Ebarahimi's videotaped confession and sentenced him to 48 months jail, including 16 months in solitary confinement.<ref name=\"Autobiography\">{{cite web|title=Autobiography|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2003/ebadi-autobio.html|work=article|publisher=NobelPrize.org}}</ref>  This case brought increased focus on Iran from human rights groups abroad.\n\nEbadi has also defended various [[child abuse]] cases and a few cases dealing with bans of periodicals (including the cases of [[Habibollah Peyman]], [[Abbas Marufi]], and [[Faraj Sarkouhi]]). She has also established two non-governmental organizations in Iran with western funding, the ''Society for Protecting the Rights of the Child'' (SPRC) and the [[Defenders of Human Rights Center]] (DHRC).<ref name=\"Autobiography\"/>\n\nShe also helped in the drafting of the original text of a law against [[physical abuse]] of children, which was passed by the [[Majlis of Iran|Iranian parliament]] in 2002.\n\n==Political views==\nIn her book ''Iran Awakening'', Ebadi explains her political/religious views on Islam, democracy and gender equality\n<blockquote>In the last 23 years, from the day I was stripped of my judgeship to the years of doing battle in the revolutionary courts of Tehran, I had repeated one refrain: an interpretation of Islam that is in harmony with equality and democracy is an authentic expression of faith. It is not religion that binds women, but the selective dictates of those who wish them cloistered. That belief, along with the conviction that change in Iran must come peacefully and from within, has underpinned my work.\"<ref>Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and Hope'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, p.204</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the same time, Ebadi expresses a nationalist love of Iran and a critical view of the Western world. She opposed the pro-Western [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]], initially supported the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]], and remembers the [[CIA]]'s [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|1953 overthrow]] of prime minister [[Mohammad Mosaddeq]] with rage.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nAt a press conference shortly after the Peace Prize announcement, Ebadi herself explicitly rejected foreign interference in the country's affairs: \"The fight for human rights is conducted in Iran by the Iranian people, and we are against any foreign intervention in Iran.\"<ref>''[[Washington Post]]'': ''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21850-2003Oct13.html Nobels With a Message]'', last retrieved on 12 October 2007</ref><ref>Working for Change: ''[http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?itemid=15804 Eyes off the prize]'', last retrieved on 12 October 2007</ref>\n\nSubsequently, Ebadi has openly defended the Islamic regime's nuclear development programme: \n<blockquote>Aside from being economically justified, it has become a cause of national pride for an old nation with a glorious history. No Iranian government, regardless of its ideology or democratic credentials, would dare to stop the program.<ref>''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'': ''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/sunnis-fear-us-missteps-will-bolster-tehrans-influence/2006/02/28/1141095740977.html?page=4 Sunnis fear US missteps will bolster Tehran's influence]'', last retrieved on 12 October 2007</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, in a 2012 interview, Ebadi has stated: \"The [Iranian] people want to stop enrichment but the government doesn\u2019t listen. Iran is situated on a fault line and people are scared of a [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] type of situation happening. We want peace, security, and economic welfare, and we cannot forgo all of our other rights for nuclear energy. The government claims it is not making a bomb. But I am not a member of the government, so I cannot speak to this directly. The fear is that if they do, [[Israel]] will be wiped out. If the Iranian people are able to topple the government, this could improve the situation. [In 2009] the people of Iran rose up and were badly suppressed. Right now, Iran is the country with the most journalists in prison.

In April 2010, Associated Students of the [[University of California]] passed a bill calling for the University to Divest itself from what it saw as [[Israel]]i [[war crimes]], by breaking ties with companies providing technology to the [[Israel Defense Forces]].

Ebadi in her Dec. 2013 speech at Human Rights Day seminar at [[Leiden University]] angrily said: \"I will shut up but the problems of Iran will not be solved\".<ref>{{YouTube|iirKRqU4Bw4}}</ref>\n\nIn light of the increased power of [[ISIL (militant group)|ISIL]], Ebadi communicated in April 2015 that she believes the Western world should spend money funding education and an end to corruption rather than fighting with guns and bombs.

[[Pope Saint John Paul II]] had been predicted to win the Peace Prize amid speculation that he was nearing death. Some observers viewed Ebadi's selection as a calculated and political one along the lines of the selection of [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], among others, for the award. Furthermore, they suggested that Ebadi's activities were not directly related to the goals of the prize as originally expressed by [[Alfred Nobel]].\n\nShe presented a book entitled ''Democracy, human rights, and Islam in modern Iran: Psychological, social and cultural perspectives'' to the Nobel Committee.

She was the second female Nobel laureate in physics, after [[Marie Curie]].\n\nA graduate of the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctorate on the theory of possible [[two-photon absorption]] by atoms. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the [[laser]] permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon [[absorption cross section]] is named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.\n\nMaria Goeppert married [[Joseph Edward Mayer]] and moved to the United States, where he was an associate professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Strict rules against [[nepotism]] prevented Johns Hopkins University from taking her on as a faculty member, but she was given a job as an assistant and published a landmark paper on [[double beta decay]] in 1935. In 1937, she moved to [[Columbia University]], where she took an unpaid position. During [[World War II]], she worked for the [[Manhattan Project]] at Columbia on [[isotope separation]], and with  [[Edward Teller]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] on the development of the [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]].\n\nAfter the war, Goeppert Mayer became a voluntary associate professor of Physics at the [[University of Chicago]] (where Teller and her husband worked) and a senior physicist at the nearby [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with [[J. Hans D. Jensen]] and [[Eugene Wigner]]. In 1960, she was appointed full professor of physics at the [[University of California at San Diego]].\n\n== Early life ==\nMaria G\u00f6ppert was born on June 28, 1906, in [[Kattowitz]] (now Katowice, [[Poland]]), a city in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the only child of [[:de:Friedrich G\u00f6ppert|Friedrich G\u00f6ppert]] and his wife Maria n\u00e9e Wolff.{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=18}} In 1910, she moved with her family to [[G\u00f6ttingen]] when her father,{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=311}} a sixth-generation university professor,{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=236}} was appointed as the professor of pediatrics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]].{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=18}} Goeppert was closer to her father than her mother. \"Well, my father was more interesting,\" she later explained. \"He was after all a scientist.\"{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=312}}\n\nG\u00f6ppert was educated at the ''H\u00f6here Technische'' in G\u00f6ttingen, a school for middle-class girls who aspired to higher education.{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=23}} In 1921, she entered the ''Frauenstudium'', a private high school run by [[suffragettes]] that aimed to prepare girls for university. She took the ''[[abitur]]'', the university entrance examination, at age 17, a year early, with three or four girls from her school and thirty boys. All the girls passed, but only one of the boys did.{{sfn|Dash|1973|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\nIn the Spring of 1924, G\u00f6ppert entered the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where she studied mathematics.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=313}} A purported shortage of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls led to an upsurge of women studying mathematics at a time of high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of mathematics at G\u00f6ttingen, [[Emmy Noether]], but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificate.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=250}}\n\nInstead, Goeppert became interested in physics, and chose to pursue a Ph.D. In her 1930 doctoral thesis<ref name=Goeppert-Mayer_1931>{{cite journal | author =Goeppert-Mayer M | title = \u00dcber Elementarakte mit zwei Quantenspr\u00fcngen | journal = Annals of Physics | year = 1931 | volume = 9 | issue =3| pages = 273\u2013295 | bibcode=1931AnP...401..273G | doi = 10.1002/andp.19314010303 }}</ref> she worked out the theory of possible [[two-photon absorption]] by atoms.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=313}} [[Eugene Wigner]] later described the thesis as \"a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness\".{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=314}} At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the [[laser]] permitted the first experimental verification in 1961 when two-photon-excited fluorescence was detected in a [[europium]]-doped crystal.<ref>{{cite journal |first=W. |last=Kaiser |first2=C.G.B. |last2=Garrett |title=Two-photon excitation in CaF<sub>2</sub>:Eu<sup>2+</sup> |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=229\u2013232 |year=1961 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.7.229|bibcode = 1961PhRvL...7..229K }}</ref> To honor her fundamental contribution to this area, the unit for the two-photon [[absorption cross section]] is named the Goeppert-Mayer (GM) unit.

She also returned to G\u00f6ttingen in the summers of 1931, 1932 and 1933 to work with her former examiner Born, writing an article with him for the ''Handbuch der Physik''. This ended when the [[NSDAP]] came to power in 1933, and many academics, including Born and Franck, lost their jobs. Goeppert Mayer and Herzfeld became involved in refugee relief efforts.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=311-312}}{{sfn|Ferry|2003|pp=40-45}}\n\nJoe Mayer was fired in 1937. He attributed this to the hatred of women on the part of the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=283}} Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=284}} Mayer took up a position at [[Columbia University]], where the chairman of the Physics Department, [[George B. Pegram]], arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with [[Harold Urey]] and [[Enrico Fermi]], who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the [[valence shell]] of the undiscovered [[transuranic elements]]. Using the [[Thomas\u2013Fermi model]], she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the [[rare earth elements]]. This proved to be correct.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=317}}\n\n== Manhattan Project ==\n[[File:HD.3A.050 (10481713035).jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Goeppert Mayer]]\nIn December 1941,  Goeppert Mayer took up her first paid professional position, teaching science part-time at [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. In the spring of 1942, with the United States embroiled in [[World War II]], she joined the [[Manhattan Project]]. She accepted a part-time research post from Urey with Columbia University's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The objective of this project was to find a means of separating the [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] isotope in natural uranium; she researched the chemical and thermodynamic properties of [[uranium hexafluoride]] and investigated the possibility of separating isotopes by photochemical reactions. This method proved impractical at the time, but the development of lasers would later open the possibility of [[separation of isotopes by laser excitation]].{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}}\n\nThrough her friend [[Edward Teller]], Goeppert Mayer was given a position at Columbia with the Opacity Project, which researched the  properties of matter and radiation at extremely high temperatures with an eye to the development of the [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]], the wartime program for the development of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}} In February 1945, Joe was sent to the [[Pacific War]], and Goeppert Mayer decided to leave her children in New York and join Teller's group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]. Joe came back from the Pacific earlier than expected, and they returned to New York together in July 1945.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}}{{sfn|Dash|1973|pp=296-299}}\n\nIn February 1946, Joe became a professor in the Chemistry Department and the new [[Institute for Nuclear Studies]] at the [[University of Chicago]], and Goeppert Mayer was able to become a voluntary associate professor of Physics at the school. When Teller also accepted a position there, she was able to continue her Opacity work with him. When the nearby [[Argonne National Laboratory]] was founded on July 1, 1946, Goeppert Mayer was also offered a part-time job there as a senior physicist in the Theoretical Physics Division. She responded \"I don't know anything about nuclear physics.\"{{sfn|Schiebinger|1999|p=59}}  She programmed the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]'s [[ENIAC]] to solve criticality problems for a [[liquid metal cooled reactor]] using the [[Monte Carlo method]].{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=319-320}}\n\n== Nuclear shell model ==\n{{Main|Nuclear shell model}}\n[[File:Maria Goeppert-Mayer (3321963421).jpg|right|thumb|Maria Goeppert Mayer walking into the Nobel ceremony with King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]] in 1963 ]]\nDuring her time at Chicago and Argonne in the late 1940s, Goeppert Mayer developed a mathematical model for the structure of [[nuclear shell model|nuclear shells]], which she published in 1950.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=16\u201321 |date=April 1950 |last=Goeppert-Mayer |first=Maria |title=Nuclear configurations in the spin-orbit coupling model.

These numbers are what Eugene Wigner called ''[[magic number (physics)|magic numbers]]'': 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. Enrico Fermi provided a critical insight by asking her: \"Is there any indication of [[spin orbit coupling]]?\"{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=322}} She realised that this was indeed the case, and postulated that the nucleus is a series of closed shells and pairs of neutrons and protons tend to couple together.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=320-321}}<ref name=\"nndb\" /> She described the idea as follows:\n{{quote|Think of a room full of waltzers.

Always questioning power relations and truth, Gordimer tells stories of ordinary people, revealing moral ambiguities and choices. Her characterization is nuanced, revealed more through the choices her characters make than through their claimed identities and beliefs. She also weaves in subtle details within the characters' names.\n\n===Overview of critical works===\nHer first published novel, ''[[The Lying Days]]'' (1953), takes place in Gordimer's home town of Springs, Transvaal, an East Rand mining town near [[Johannesburg]]. Arguably a semi-autobiographical work, ''The Lying Days'' is a [[Bildungsroman]], charting the growing political awareness of a young white woman, Helen, toward small-town life and South African racial division.<ref name=\"Norman\">Judith Norman, \"[http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/special-commissioned-essay-lying-days-by-nadine/themes-lying-days?print=1 Special Commissioned Essay on ''The Lying Days'']\".</ref>\n\nIn her 1963 work, ''Occasion for Loving'', Gordimer puts apartheid and love squarely together. Her protagonist, Ann Davis, is married to Boaz Davis, an ethnomusicologist, but in love with Gideon Shibalo, an artist with several failed relationships. Ann Davis is white, however, and Gideon Shibalo is black, and South Africa's government criminalised such relationships.\n\nGordimer collected the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for ''A Guest of Honour'' in 1971 and, in common with a number of winners of this award, she was to go on to win the [[Booker Prize]]. The Booker was awarded to Gordimer for her 1974 novel, ''[[The Conservationist]]'',<ref>''[[The Conservationist]]''</ref> and was a co-winner with [[Stanley Middleton]]'s novel ''Holiday''. ''[[The Conservationist]]'' explores [[Zulu people|Zulu]] culture and the world of a wealthy white industrialist through the eyes of Mehring, the [[antihero]]. [[Per W\u00e4stberg]] described ''The Conservationist'' as Gordimer's \"densest and most poetical novel\".<ref name=\"Wastberg\" /> Thematically covering the same ground as [[Olive Schreiner]]'s ''The Story of an African Farm'' (1883) and [[J. M. Coetzee]]'s ''In the Heart of the Country'' (1977), the \"conservationist\" seeks to conserve nature to preserve the apartheid system, keeping change at bay. When an unidentified corpse is found on his farm, Mehring does the \"right thing\" by providing it a proper burial; but the dead person haunts the work, a reminder of the bodies on which Mehring's vision would be built.\n\nGordimer's 1979 novel ''[[Burger's Daughter]]'' is the story of a woman analysing her relationship with her father, a martyr to the anti-apartheid movement. The child of two Communist and anti-apartheid revolutionaries, Rosa Burger finds herself drawn into political activism as well. Written in the aftermath of the 1976 [[Soweto uprising]], the novel was shortly thereafter banned by the South African government. Gordimer described the novel as a \"coded homage\" to [[Bram Fischer]], the lawyer who defended [[Nelson Mandela]] and other anti-apartheid activists.<ref name=\"Wastberg\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.wits.ac.za/bramfischer/then.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704102111/http://www.law.wits.ac.za/bramfischer/then.htm|archivedate=4 July 2007|title=Bram Fischer Human Rights Programme|work=Wits School of Law|year=2005|accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[July's People]]'' (1981), she imagines a bloody South African revolution, in which white people are hunted and murdered after blacks revolt against the apartheid government. The work follows Maureen and Bamford Smales, an educated white couple, hiding for their lives with July, their long-time former servant. The novel plays off the various groups of \"July's people\": his family and his village, as well as the Smales. The story examines how people cope with the terrible choices forced on them by violence, race hatred, and the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n''The House Gun'' (1998) was Gordimer's second post-apartheid novel. It follows the story of a couple, Claudia and Harald Lingard, dealing with their son Duncan's murder of one of his housemates. The novel treats the rising crime rate in South Africa and the guns that virtually all households have, as well as the legacy of South African apartheid and the couple's concerns about their son's lawyer, who is black. The novel was optioned for film rights to Granada Productions.<ref name=\"Garner\">Dwight Garner and Nadine Gordimer, [http://www.salon.com/books/int/1998/03/cov_si_09int.html The Salon Interview: Nadine Gordimer], March 1998.</ref><ref>Bookreporter.com, [http://www.readinggroupguides.com/guides/house_gun.asp ReadingGroup Guide], ''The House Gun'' by Nadine Gordimer.</ref><ref name=\"Medalie\">David Medalie, \"'The Context of the Awful Event': Nadine Gordimer's ''The House Gun''\", ''Journal of South African Studies'', v.25, n.4 (December 1999), pp. 633\u2013644.</ref>\n\nGordimer's award-winning 2002 novel, ''[[The Pickup]]'', considers the issues of displacement, alienation, and immigration; class and economic power; religious faith; and the ability for people to see, and love, across these divides.

While at UC Berkeley, Greider co-discovered [[telomerase]], a key enzyme in cancer and anemia research, along with Blackburn.\n\nGreider joined Blackburn's laboratory in April 1984 looking for the enzyme that was hypothesized to add extra DNA bases to the ends of chromosomes. Without the extra bases, which are added as repeats of a six base pair motif, chromosomes are shortened during DNA replication, eventually resulting in chromosome deterioration and [[senescence]] or cancer-causing chromosome fusion. Blackburn and Greider looked for the enzyme in the model organism ''[[Tetrahymena|Tetrahymena thermophila]]'', a fresh-water protozoan with a large number of telomeres.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503019102| pmid = 15928079| year = 2005| last1 = Nuzzo | first1 = R.| title = Biography of Carol W.

After six months of additional research Greider and Blackburn concluded that it was the enzyme responsible for telomere addition. They published their findings in the journal ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'' in December, 1985.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| pmid = 3907856\n| year = 1985\n| last1 = Greider | first1 = C.

During this time, Greider, in collaboration with [[Ronald A. DePinho]], produced the first telomerase [[knockout mouse]], showing that although telomerase is dispensable for life, increasingly short telomeres result in various deleterious phenotypes, colloquially referred to as premature aging.

Only once, when she was 13, did she make an extended visit to her parents, who by then had moved to [[Khartoum]], although both parents continued to visit England each summer.\n\n==Education and research==\nShe developed a passion for chemistry from a young age, and her mother fostered her interest in science in general. Her state school education left her without Latin or a further science subject, but she took private tuition in order to enter the [[University of Oxford]] entrance examination.

However, many relatives became victims of the [[Holocaust]]. Her mother, with whom she had a strained relationship, was from a formerly prosperous [[Vienna]] family. As a child, Elfriede attended a Roman Catholic convent school in Vienna. Her mother planned a career for her as a musical [[wunderkind]]. She was instructed in piano, organ, guitar, violin, viola and recorder from an early age. Later, she went on to study at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]], where she graduated with an organist diploma; during this time, she tried to meet her mother's high expectations while coping with her psychologically ill father.<ref name=\"Boiter\"/> She studied [[art history]] and theater at the [[University of Vienna]]. However, she had to discontinue her studies due to an [[anxiety disorder]], which resulted in self-isolation at her parents' house for a year. During this time, she began serious literary work as a form of therapy. After a year, she began to feel comfortable leaving the house, often with her mother.<ref name=\"Boiter\">{{cite book|last=Boiter|first=Vera|title=Elfriede Jelinek|publisher=Greenwood Press|series=Women Writers in German-Speaking Countries|year=1998|location=Westport, CT|pages=199\u2013207}}</ref> She began writing poetry at a young age. She made her literary debut with ''Lisas Schatten'' (''Lisa's Shadow'') in 1967, and received her first literary prize in 1969.

Despite the author's own differentiation from Austria (due to her criticism of Austria's Nazi past) Jelinek's writing is deeply rooted in the tradition of [[Austrian literature]], showing the influence of Austrian writers such as [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], [[Marlen Haushofer]], and [[Robert Musil]].<ref name=\"Theater\"/>\n\nJelinek's political positions, in particular her feminist stance and her Communist Party affiliations, are of vital importance to any assessment of her work. They are also a part of the reason for the controversy directed at Jelinek and her work. Editor Friederike Eigler states that Jelinek has three major and inter-related \"targets\" in her writing: capitalist consumer society and its [[commodification]] of all human beings and relationships, the remnants of Austria's fascist past in public and private life, and the systematic [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and oppression of women in a capitalist-[[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society.<ref>{{Citation|last = Eigler|first = Friederike|contribution = Jelinek, Elfriede|year = 1997|title = The Feminist Encyclopedia of German Literature|editor-last = Eigler|editor-first = Friederike|pages = 263\u20134|place = Westport, CT|publisher = Greenwood Press}}</ref>\n\n=== Political engagement ===\nJelinek was a member of Austria's [[Communist Party of Austria|Communist Party]] from 1974 to 1991. She became a household name during the 1990s due to her vociferous clash with [[J\u00f6rg Haider]]'s [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]]. Following the 1999 [[National Council of Austria|National Council]] elections and the subsequent formation of a coalition cabinet consisting of the Freedom Party and the [[Austrian People's Party]], Jelinek became one of the new cabinet's most vocal critics.\n\nMany foreign governments moved swiftly to ostracize Austria's administration, citing the Freedom Party's alleged nationalism and [[authoritarianism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\nThe cabinet construed the sanctions against it as directed against Austria as such, and attempted to prod the nation into a national rallying (''Nationaler Schulterschluss'') behind the coalition parties. This provoked a temporary heating of the political climate severe enough for dissidents such as Jelinek to be accused of [[treason]] by coalition supporters.\n\nJelinek petitioned for the release of [[Jack Unterweger]], who was imprisoned for the murder of a prostitute, and who was regarded by intellectuals and politicians as an example of successful rehabilitation. Unterweger was later found guilty of murdering nine more women within two years of his release, and committed suicide after his arrest.<ref name=\"unterweger's suicide\">[http://www.biography.com/people/jack-unterweger-12103266 Johann Unterweger biography], Johann Unterweger. (2014). The Biography.com website. Retrieved 11:10, Nov 22, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Work===\nJelinek's work is multi-faceted and highly controversial. It has been praised and condemned by leading [[literary criticism|literary critics]].<ref name=\"Gale\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Elfriede Jelinek|encyclopedia=Contemporary Literary Criticism|volume=169|pages=67\u2013155|publisher=Gale|date=March 2003}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Fritzl incest case|Fritzl case]], for example, she was accused of \"executing 'hysterical' portraits of Austrian perversity\".<ref>\"[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23643630-2703,00.html Wife of incest dad under suspicion]\". [[The Australian]], 5 May 2008.</ref> Likewise, her political activism has encountered divergent and often heated reactions. Despite the controversy surrounding her work, Jelinek has won many distinguished awards; among them are the [[Georg B\u00fcchner Prize]] in 1998; the [[M\u00fclheim Dramatists Prize]] in 2002 and 2004; the [[Franz Kafka Prize]] in 2004; and the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], also in 2004.<ref name=\"Gale\"/>\n\n[[Female sexuality]], sexual abuse, and the battle of the sexes in general are prominent topics in her work. Texts such as ''Wir sind Lockv\u00f6gel, Baby!'' (''We are Decoys, Baby!''), ''[[Women as Lovers (Book)|Die Liebhaberinnen]]'' (''Women as Lovers'') and ''Die Klavierspielerin'' (''The Piano Teacher'') showcase the brutality and power play inherent in human relations in a style that is, at times, ironically formal and tightly controlled. According to Jelinek, power and aggression are often the principal driving forces of [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. Her provocative novel ''[[Lust (Jelinek novel)|Lust]]'' contains graphic description of sexuality, aggression and abuse. It received poor reviews by many critics, some of whom likened it to pornography. But others, who noted the power of the cold descriptions of moral failures, considered it to have been misunderstood and undervalued by them.<ref name=\"Gale\"/>\n\nHer novel ''[[The Piano Teacher (Jelinek novel)|The Piano Teacher]]'' was the basis for the [[The Piano Teacher (2001 film)|2001 film of the same title]] by Austrian director [[Michael Haneke]], starring [[Isabelle Huppert]] as the protagonist. In April 2006, Jelinek spoke out to support [[Peter Handke]], whose play ''[[Die Kunst des Fragens]]'' (''The Art of Asking'') was removed from the repertoire of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] for his alleged support of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. Her work is less known in English-speaking countries. However, in July and August 2012 a major English language premiere of her play ''Ein Sportst\u00fcck'' by Just a Must theatre company brought her dramatic work to the attention of English-speaking audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2012/07/elfriede-jelinek-game-on/|title=Accounts|website=www.thestage.co.uk|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://postcardsgods.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/sports-play-nuffield-theatre-lancaster.html|title=Postcards from the Gods: Sports Play - Nuffield Theatre, Lancaster|website=postcardsgods.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/stage/theatre/article3474101.ece|title=Sports Play at the Nuffield, Lancaster {{!}} The Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref> The following year, in February and March 2013, the Women's Project in New York staged the North American premiere of ''Jackie'', one of her ''Princess Dramas''.<ref>http://wptheater.org/show/jackie/</ref>\n\n==The Nobel Prize==\nJelinek said she felt very happy to receive the Nobel Prize, but felt \"despair for becoming a known, a person of the public\". Known for her modesty and subtle [[Irony#Metafiction|self-irony]], she \u2013 a reputed feminist writer \u2013 wondered if she had been awarded the prize mainly for \"being a woman\", and suggested that among authors writing in German, [[Peter Handke]], whom she praises as a \"living classic\", would have been a more worthy recipient.<ref name=\"Theater\">{{cite journal|last=Honegger|first=Gitta|title=How to Get the Nobel Prize Without Really Trying|journal=Theater|volume=36|issue=2|pages=5\u201319|publisher=Duke UP|location=Yale School of Drama|year=2006|doi=10.1215/01610775-36-2-4}}</ref>\n\nJelinek was criticized for not accepting the prize in person; instead, a [http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/2004/jelinek-lecture.html video message] was presented at the ceremony. Others appreciated how Jelinek revealed that she suffers from [[agoraphobia]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], paranoid conditions that developed when she first decided to write seriously.<ref name=\"nobel\"/> Both conditions are anxiety disorders which can be highly disruptive to everyday functioning yet are often concealed by those affected, out of shame, or feelings of inadequacy. She has said her anxiety disorders make it impossible for her to go to the cinema or board an airplane (in an interview she wished to be able to fly to New York to see the skyscrapers one day before dying), and incapable of taking part in any ceremony.\n\nIn 2005, [[Knut Ahnlund]] left the [[Swedish Academy]] in protest, describing Jelinek's work as \"whining, unenjoyable public pornography\", as well as \"a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure\".

After a year of traditional education, which began when she was 10 years old, her parents realized her obvious mathematical talent and decided that Ir\u00e8ne\u2019s academic abilities needed a more challenging environment. Irene joined forces with a number of eminent French scholars, including the prominent French physicist [[Paul Langevin]] to form \u201c[[The Cooperative]],\u201d a private gathering of some of the most distinguished academics in France. Each contributed to educating one another\u2019s children in their respective homes. The curriculum of The Cooperative was varied and included not only the principles of science and scientific research but such diverse subjects as Chinese and sculpture and with great emphasis placed on self-expression and play.<ref>http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/ci/1992/IreneJoliot-Curie.html Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation</ref>\n\nThis arrangement lasted for two years after which Curie re-entered a more orthodox learning environment at the [[Coll\u00e8ge S\u00e9vign\u00e9]] in central Paris from 1912 to 1914 and then onto the Faculty of Science at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], to complete her [[bachelor's degree|Baccalaureate]]. Her studies at the Faculty of Science were interrupted by [[World War I]].\n\n===World War I===\nInitially, Curie was taken to the countryside, but a year later when she turned 18 she was re-united with her mother, Marie Curie, who was running the twenty mobile field hospitals that she had established. The hospitals were equipped with primitive X-ray equipment made possible by the Curies' radiochemical research. This technology greatly assisted doctors to locate shrapnel in wounded soldiers, but it was crude and led to both Marie and Ir\u00e8ne, who were serving as nurse radiographers, suffering large doses of radiation exposure. Both would eventually die from the consequences of accumulated radiation exposure over their professional life.\n\nAfter the war, Curie returned to Paris to study at the [[Curie Institute, Paris|Radium Institute]], which had been built by her parents. The institute was completed in 1914 but remained empty during the war. Her doctoral thesis was concerned with the alpha decay of [[polonium]], the element discovered by her parents (along with radium) and named after Marie\u2019s country of birth, Poland. Curie became Doctor of Science in 1925.\n\n===Research===\n[[File:Irene and Marie Curie 1925.jpg|left|thumb|Irene and Marie Curie in 1925]]\nAs she neared the end of her doctorate in 1924, Curie was asked to teach the precise laboratory techniques required for radiochemical research to the young chemical engineer [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot]], whom she would later wed.\nFrom 1928 Joliot-Curie and her husband Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric combined their research efforts on the study of atomic nuclei. Though their experiments identified both the [[positron]] and the [[neutron]], they failed to interpret the significance of the results and the discoveries were later claimed by [[Carl David Anderson]] and [[James Chadwick]] respectively. These discoveries would have secured greatness indeed, as together with [[J. J. Thomson]]'s discovery of the [[electron]] in 1897, they finally replaced [[John Dalton]]\u2019s [[Atomic_theory#Dalton|model]] of atoms as solid spherical particles.\n\nIn 1934 the Joliot-Curies finally made the discovery that sealed their place in scientific history. Building on the work of Marie and Pierre Curie, who had isolated naturally-occurring radioactive elements, the Joliot-Curies realized the alchemist\u2019s dream of turning one element into another: creating radioactive [[nitrogen]] from [[boron]], radioactive isotopes of [[phosphorus]] from [[aluminum]], and [[silicon]] from [[magnesium]]. Irradiating the natural stable isotope of aluminum with [[alpha particles]] (i.e. helium nuclei) results in an [[Isotopes of phosphorus|unstable isotope of phosphorus]] : <sup>27</sup>Al + <sup>4</sup>He \u2192 <sup>30</sup>P + <sup>1</sup>n.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1935/joliot-curie-lecture.html|title=Nobel Lecture: Artificial Production of Radioactive Elements|date=December 12, 1935|author=Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1935/joliot-fred-lecture.pdf|title=Chemical Evidence of the Transmutation of Elements|date=December 12, 1935|author=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/Phase2/Joliot-Curie,_Irene@841891460.html|publisher=[[Contributions of 20th Century Women to Physics|CWP]]|author=Byers, Moszkowski, Chadwick (via 1956 Nature obituary) |title=Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie Contributions and Bibliography}}</ref> By then the application of radioactive materials for use in medicine was growing and this discovery allowed radioactive materials to be created quickly, cheaply, and plentifully. The Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1935 brought with it fame and recognition from the scientific community and Joliot-Curie was awarded a professorship at the Faculty of Science.\n\nIr\u00e8ne\u2019s group pioneered research into radium nuclei that led a separate group of German physicists, led by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], and [[Fritz Strassman]], to discover [[nuclear fission]]: the splitting of the nucleus itself, emitting vast amounts of energy. Lise Meitner's now-famous calculations actually disproved Ir\u00e8ne's results to show that nuclear fission was possible.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nYears of working so closely with radioactive materials finally caught up with Joliot-Curie and she was diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. She had been accidentally exposed to [[polonium]] when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench in 1946. Treatment with antibiotics and a series of operations relieved her suffering temporarily but her condition continued to deteriorate. Despite this, Joliot-Curie continued to work and in 1955 drew up plans for new physics laboratories at the University d\u2019Orsay, south of Paris.\n\n===Political views===\nThe Joliot-Curies had become increasingly aware of the growth of the [[Fascism|fascist]] movement. They opposed its ideals and joined the Socialist Party in 1934, the ''[[Comit\u00e9 de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes]]'' a year later, and in 1936 actively supported the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In the same year, Joliot-Curie was appointed Undersecretary of State for Scientific Research by the French government, in which capacity she helped in founding the ''[[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]]''.\n\nThe Joliot-Curies had continued Pierre and Marie\u2019s policy of publishing all of their work for the benefit of the global scientific community, but afraid of the danger that might result should it be developed for military use, they stopped. On 30 October 1939 they placed all of their documentation on nuclear fission in the vaults of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], where it remained until 1949.\n\nJoliot-Curie's political career continued after the war and she became a commissioner in the ''[[Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique]]''. However, she still found time for scientific work and in 1946 became director of her mother\u2019s ''Institut du Radium'' ([[Curie Institute (Paris)|Radium Institute]]).\n\nJoliot-Curie became actively involved in promoting women\u2019s education, serving on the National Committee of the Union of French Women (''Comit\u00e9 National de l'Union des Femmes Fran\u00e7aises'') and the [[World Peace Council]]. Joliot-Curies were given memberships to the French ''[[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]''; Ir\u00e8ne as an officer and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric as a commissioner, recognising his earlier work for the resistance.\n\n===Personal life===\n[[File:Frederic and Irene Joliot-Curie.jpg|280px|thumb|The Joliot-Curies in the 1940s]]\nIr\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric hyphenated their surnames to Joliot-Curie after they married in 1926. Eleven months later, their daughter [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Langevin-Joliot|H\u00e9l\u00e8ne]] was born; she would also become a noted physicist. Their son, [[Pierre Joliot|Pierre]], a biologist, was born in 1932.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Joliot-Curie contracted tuberculosis and was forced to spend several years convalescing in Switzerland. Concern for her own health together with the anguish of leaving her husband and children in occupied France was hard to bear and she did make several dangerous visits back to France, enduring detention by German troops at the Swiss border on more than one occasion. Finally, in 1944 Joliot-Curie judged it too dangerous for her family to remain in France and she took her children back to Switzerland.\n\nIn 1956, after a final convalescent period in the French Alps, Joliot-Curie was admitted to the Curie hospital in Paris, where she died on 17 March at the age of 58 from leukemia.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Q&A: Polonium-210 | url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2006/November/27110601.asp | work=Chemistry World | publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry | date=27 November 2006 | accessdate=2008-09-04}}</ref>\n\nJoliot-Curie was an atheist.<ref>\"It was to her grandfather, a convinced freethinker, that Ir\u00e8ne owed her atheism, later politically expressed as anticlericalism.\" [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Irene_Joliot-Curie.aspx Joliot-Curie, Ir\u00e8ne.] Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. 2008.

She was born with a [[Hip dysplasia (human)|hip injury]]. An early sickness left her lame in both legs, although she later recovered.  She was a quiet child, more serious than others her age, with a deep love of [[Reading (process)|reading]]. She was constantly writing poetry as a child, but did not publish anything officially until later in life. Her grandfather helped raise her, often telling stories of fairytales and fantasy. The sale of M\u00e5rbacka following her father's illness in 1884 had a serious impact on her development. Selma's father is said to have been an alcoholic, something she rarely discussed.<ref name=\"Selma Lagerl\u00f6f: Surface and Depth\">{{Cite web|url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/01/11/selma-lagerlof-surface-and-depth/|title=Selma Lagerl\u00f6f: Surface and Depth|website=The Public Domain Review|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> Her father did not want Selma to continue an education, or remain involved with the woman's movement.

She worked as a country schoolteacher at a high school for girls in [[Landskrona]] from 1885 to 1895<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Lagerlof, Ottilia Lovisa Selma}}</ref> while honing her story-telling skills, with particular focus on the legends she had learned as a child. Through her studies at the Royal Women's Superior Training Academy in [[Stockholm]], Lagerl\u00f6f reacted against the realism of contemporary Swedish language writers such as [[August Strindberg]]. She began her first novel, ''[[G\u00f6sta Berling's Saga]],'' while working as a teacher in [[Landskrona]]. Her first break as a writer came when she submitted the first chapters to a literary contest, and won a publishing contract for the whole book. At first, her writing only received mild reviews from critics.  Once a popular male critic, George Brandes, gave her positive reviews of the Danish translation, her popularity skyrocketed.<ref name=\"Selma Lagerl\ufffdf\">{{Cite web|url=http://authorscalendar.info/lagerlof.htm|title=Selma Ottiliana Lovisa Lagerl\u00f6f (1858\u20131940)|website=authorscalendar.info|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> She received financial support of [[Fredrika Limnell]], who wished to enable her to concentrate on her writing.\n\n[[File:Selma Lagerlof nobel prize illustration.png|right|thumb|Selma Lagerl\u00f6f receives the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

A Swedish writer of Jewish origin, Elkan became her friend and companion and their letters suggest Lagerl\u00f6f fell deeply in love with her.<ref name=\"glbtq\">{{citation |last=Munck |first=Kerstin |title=Lagerl\u00f6f, Selma |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |year=2002 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/lagerlof_s.html}}</ref> She is said to have been a lesbian and was involved with many different women.  Over many years, Elkan and Lagerl\u00f6f critiqued each other's work. Lagerl\u00f6f wrote of Elkan's strong influence on her work, often disagreeing sharply with the direction Lagerl\u00f6f wanted to take in her books.  Selma's letters to Sophie were published in 1993, titled Du lar mig att bli fri <ref name=\"Selma Lagerl\ufffdf\" />\n\nA visit in 1900 to the [[American Colony (Jerusalem)|American Colony]] in [[Jerusalem]] became the inspiration for Lagerl\u00f6f's book by that name.<ref name=\"change\">{{citation |url=http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/TimesOfChange/book_ch1_3.html |title=Times of Change |first=Heike |last=Zaun-Goshen |year=2002}}</ref> The royal family and the Swedish Academy gave her substantial financial support to continue her passion<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1909/lagerlof-bio.html|title=Selma Lagerl\u00f6f \u2013 Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> By 1895, she gave up her teaching to devote herself to her writing. With the help of proceeds from ''G\u00f6sta Berlings Saga'' and a scholarship and grant, she made two journeys which were largely instrumental in providing material for her next novel. With Elkan, she traveled to Italy, and she also traveled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and other parts of the East.<ref>{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Lagerl\u00f6f, Selma}}</ref> In [[Italy]], a legend of a Christ Child figure that had been replaced with a false version inspired Lagerl\u00f6f's novel ''Antikrists mirakler'' (''The Miracles of the Antichrist''). Set in [[Sicily]], the novel explores the interplay between Christian and socialist moral systems.  However, most of Lagerl\u00f6f's stories were set in [[V\u00e4rmland]].\n\nLagerlof was asked by the National Teacher's Association in 1902 to write a geography book for children.  She interestingly combined informative facts of Sweden's geography with a boy named Nils Holgersson.  When the boy got in trouble, he traveled to many different provinces, allowing children to learn about Sweden while staying interested.<ref name=\"Selma Lagerl\u00f6f: Surface and Depth\" />\n\nShe moved in 1897 to [[Falun]], and met [[Valborg Olander]], who became her literary assistant and friend, but Elkan's jealousy of Olander was a complication in the relationship. Olander, a teacher, was also active in the growing [[women's suffrage movement]] in Sweden. Selma Lagerl\u00f6f herself was active as a speaker for the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]], which was beneficial for the organisation because of the great respect which surrounded Lagerl\u00f6f, and she spoke at the International Suffrage Congress in Stockholm in June 1911, where she gave the opening address, as well as at the victory party of the Swedish suffrage movement after women suffrage had been granted in May 1919.<ref>Barbro Hedwall (2011).

Shortly before her death in 1940, Lagerl\u00f6f intervened with the Swedish royal family to secure the release of Sachs and Sachs' aged mother from Nazi Germany, on the very last flight from Germany to Sweden, and their lifelong asylum in Stockholm.\n\n== Literary adaptations ==\n[[File:Selma Lagerlof.jpg|thumb|A street in [[Jerusalem]], named for Selma Lagerlof]]\nIn 1919 Lagerl\u00f6f sold all the movie rights to all of her as-yet unpublished works to Swedish Cinema Theatre ({{lang-sv|Svenska Biografteatern}}), and so over the years many movie versions of her works were made.

Doris Lessing's first novel ''[[The Grass Is Singing]]'', as well as the collection of short stories ''African Stories'', are set in [[Southern Rhodesia]] (today Zimbabwe) where she was then living.\n\nThis was followed by a [[Psychology|psychological]] phase from 1956 to 1969, including the ''Golden Notebook'' and the \"Children of Violence\" quartet.\n\nThird came the [[Sufism|Sufi]] phase, explored in the [[Canopus in Argos]] sequence of science fiction (or as she preferred to put it \"space fiction\") novels and novellas.\n\nLessing's Canopus sequence was not popular with many mainstream [[literary critic]]s. For example, in the ''New York Times'' in 1982 [[John Leonard (American critic)|John Leonard]] wrote in reference to ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' that \"[o]ne of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable is that it has discouraged Mrs. Lessing...

Using [[Sufi]] concepts, to which Lessing had been introduced in the mid-1960s by her \"good friend and teacher\" [[Idries Shah]],<ref name=\"Lessingon\"/> the series of novels also utilises an approach similar to that employed by the early 20th century mystic [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] in his work ''[[All and Everything]]''. Earlier works of \"inner space\" fiction like ''Briefing for a Descent into Hell'' (1971) and ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974) also connect to this theme. Lessing's interest had turned to Sufism after coming to the realisation that Marxism ignored spiritual matters, leaving her disillusioned.<ref>\"Postcolonial Nostalgias: Writing, Representation and Memory\", Volume 31 of ''Routledge research in postcolonial literatures'', Dennis Walder, Taylor & Francis ltd, 2010, p92.

She also regretted that critics failed to appreciate the exceptional structure of the novel. She explained in ''Walking in the Shade'' that she modelled Molly partly on her good friend [[Joan Rodker]], the daughter of the modernist poet and publisher [[John Rodker]].<ref>[http://www.otago.ac.nz/DeepSouth/0498/0498lynda.htm Lessing's Early and Transitional Novels: The Beginnings of a Sense of Selfhood]. Retrieved 17 October 2007.</ref>\n\nLessing did not like being pigeon-holed as a feminist author. When asked why, she explained: {{Quote|What the feminists want of me is something they haven't examined because it comes from religion. They want me to bear witness. What they would really like me to say is, 'Ha, sisters, I stand with you side by side in your struggle toward the golden dawn where all those beastly men are no more.' Do they really want people to make oversimplified statements about men and women? In fact, they do. I've come with great regret to this conclusion.|Doris Lessing|[[The New York Times]], 25 July 1982<ref name=\"space fiction\"/>}}\n\n==Doris Lessing Society==\nThe Doris Lessing Society is dedicated to supporting the scholarly study of Lessing\u2019s work. The formal structure of the Society dates from January 1977, when the first issue of the ''Doris Lessing Newsletter'' was published. In 2002 the Newsletter became the academic journal, ''Doris Lessing Studies''. The Society also organizes panels at the [[Modern Language Association|Modern Languages Association (MLA)]] annual Conventions and has held two international conferences in [[New Orleans]] in 2004 and [[Leeds]] in 2007.<ref>[http://dorislessingsociety.wordpress.com/ Official website]</ref>\n\n==Archive==\nLessing's literary archive is held by the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]], at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. The 45 archival boxes of Lessing's materials at the Ransom Center contain nearly all of her extant manuscripts and typescripts up to 1999.

When the Germans invaded Italy in 1943 her family fled south to [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], where she set up a second laboratory in a corner of their shared living space. During this time she also volunteered her medical expertise for the Allied health service. Her family returned to Turin in 1945.\n\nIn September 1946, Levi-Montalcini was granted a one-semester research fellowship in the laboratory of Professor [[Viktor Hamburger]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]].  After she duplicated the results of her home laboratory experiments, Hamburger offered her a research associate position, which she held for 30 years. It was there that, in 1952, she did her most important work: isolating [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) from observations of certain cancerous tissues that cause extremely rapid growth of nerve cells.<ref name=\"fox1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/30/nobel-winning-scientist-levi-montalcini-dies-in-rome-at-103-biologist-studied/|title=Nobel-winning scientist Levi-Montalcini dies in Rome at 103, biologist studied growth factor|date=30 December 2012|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> By transferring pieces of tumors to chick embryos, Montalcini established a mass of cells that was full of nerve fibers. This discovery, of nerves growing everywhere like a halo around the tumor cells, was surprising. Montalcini described this \"like rivulets of water flowing steadily over a bed of stones.\" <ref name=makersmodernsci>{{cite book|last=Yount|first=Lisa|title=Rita Levi-Montalcini: Discoverer of Nerve Growth Factor|year=2009|publisher=Chelsea House}}</ref> The nerve growth produced by the tumor was unlike anything she had seen before \u2013 the nerves took over areas that would become other tissues and even entered veins in the embryo. But nerves did not grow into the arteries, which would flow from the embryo back to the tumor. This suggested to Montalcini that the tumor itself was releasing a substance that was stimulating the growth of nerves. \nShe was made a full professor in 1958. In 1962 she established a second laboratory in [[Rome]] and divided her time between there and St. Louis.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1969 she directed the Research Center of Neurobiology of the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]] (Rome), and from 1969 to 1978 the Laboratory of Cellular Biology.<ref name=\"fox1\"/>\n\nLevi-Montalcini founded the European Brain Research Institute in 2002, and then served as its president.<ref name=eashingtonuni>{{cite web|title=Rita Levi-Montalcini|url=http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mig/bios/levi-montalcini.html|publisher=Washington University|accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=network>{{cite web|title=The European Brain Research Institute in Rome|url=http://www.eni-net.org/organization/home-institutions/the-european-brain-research-institute-in-rome/|publisher=Network of European Neuroscience Institutes|accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> Her role in this institute was at the center of some criticism from some parts of the scientific community in 2010.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/463270a |title=Self-inflicted damage.The autocratic actions of an institute's founder could destroy a centre of excellence for brain research |journal=Nature |volume=463 |pages=270 |date=21 January 2010 |issue=7279}}</ref>\n\nControversies were raised about the cooperation of Levi-Montalcini with the Italian pharmaceutical industry Fidia . While working for Fidia, she improved the understanding of [[gangliosides]]. Beginning in 1975, the scientist supported the drug Cronassial (a particular ganglioside) produced by Fidia from bovine [[brain]] tissue.

As per the normal cautionary routine, Germany banned Cronassial in 1983, followed by other countries. Italy prohibited the drug only in 1993; at the same time, an investigation revealed that Fidia paid the Italian Ministry of Health for a quick approval of Cronassial and later paid for pushing use of the drug in treatment of diseases where it had not been tested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmi.unipg.it/~mamone/univ/QUALIT.htm|title=Qualit\u00e0 Intellettuale|publisher=UNIPG|accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dica33.it/argomenti/farmacologia/farmacovigilanza/farmacovigilanza2.asp|title=Fallimenti storici|publisher=Dica33|accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicamolecolare.blogspot.com/2007/11/rita-levi-di-montalcini-e-i.html|title=Rita Levi Montalcini e la vicenda Cronossial|publisher=Politica Molecolare|date=November 2011|accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref>  Levi-Montalcini's relationship with the company was revealed during the investigation, and she was criticized publicly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/02/22/nobel-comprato-non-ne-so-nulla.html|title=Nobel comprato?

Maathai was an elected [[National Assembly of Kenya|member of Parliament]] and served as assistant minister for [[Natural environment|Environment]] and [[Natural resource|Natural Resources]] in the government of [[President of Kenya|President]] [[Mwai Kibaki]] between January 2003 and November 2005. She was an Honorary Councillor of the [[World Future Council]]. In 2011, Maathai died of complications from [[ovarian cancer]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nOn 1 April 1940, Maathai was born in the village of Ihithe, [[Nyeri District]], in the [[Central Province (Kenya)|central highlands]] of the [[colony of Kenya]]. Her family was [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], the most populous [[List of ethnic groups of Kenya|ethnic group in Kenya]], and had lived in the area for several generations.<ref>Wangari Maathai, ''Unbowed: A Memoir'', [[Alfred A.

Her father remained at the farm.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 29.</ref> Shortly afterward, at the age of eight, she joined her brothers at Ihithe Primary School.\n\nAt age eleven, Maathai moved to St. Cecilia's Intermediate Primary School, a [[boarding school]] at the [[Nyeri#Religion|Mathari Catholic Mission]] in Nyeri.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 53.</ref> Maathai studied at St. Cecilia's for four years. During this time, she became fluent in English and converted to Catholicism. She was involved with the [[Legion of Mary]], whose members attempted \"to serve God by serving fellow human beings.\"<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 60\u201361.</ref> Studying at St. Cecilia's, she was sheltered from the ongoing [[Mau Mau Uprising]], which forced her mother to move from their homestead to an emergency village in Ihithe.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 63\u201369.</ref> When she completed her studies there in 1956, she was rated first in her class, and was granted admission to the only Catholic high school for girls in Kenya, [[Loreto High School, Limuru|Loreto High School]] in [[Limuru]].<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 69.</ref>\n\nHowever, the end of  East African colonialism was nearing, and Kenyan politicians, such as [[Tom Mboya]], were proposing ways to make education in [[Western world#Modern definitions|Western nations]] available to promising students. [[John F. Kennedy]], then a [[United States Senator]], agreed to fund such a program through the [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation]], initiating what became known as the Kennedy Airlift or Airlift Africa.

She was a member of the Kenya Association of University Women. Following the establishment of the Environment Liaison Centre in 1974, Maathai was asked to be a member of the local board, eventually becoming board chair. The Environment Liaison Centre worked to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations in the work of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), whose headquarters was established in Nairobi following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972. Maathai also joined the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK).<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 119\u2013122.</ref> Through her work at these various volunteer associations, it became evident to Maathai that the root of most of Kenya's problems was environmental degradation.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 124\u2013125.</ref>\n{{Quote box |quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=We hoped that these elections would provide the people of Kenya with a fairer and truer representation of their aspirations and beliefs.

Voters lined up behind their candidate and election officials counted each line and then told the people to go home. When election officials announced the winner, it was often the candidate with the shortest line of voters behind him!

Her husband campaigned again for a seat in Parliament, hoping to represent the [[Langata Constituency|Lang'ata constituency]], and won. During his campaign, he had promised to find jobs to limit the rising unemployment in Kenya. These promises led Maathai to connect her ideas of environmental restoration to providing jobs for the unemployed, and led to the founding of Envirocare Ltd., a business that involved the planting of trees to conserve the environment, involving ordinary people in the process. This led to the planting of her first tree nursery, collocated with a government tree nursery in [[Karura Forest]]. Envirocare ran into multiple problems, primarily dealing with funding. The project failed. However, through conversations concerning Envirocare and her work at the Environment Liaison Centre, UNEP made it possible to send Maathai to the first [[Habitat I|UN conference on human settlements]], known as Habitat I, in June 1976.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 125\u2013129.</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Maathai spoke to the NCWK concerning her attendance at Habitat I. She proposed further tree planting, which the council supported. On 5 June 1977, marking World Environment Day, the NCWK marched in a procession from Kenyatta International Conference Centre in downtown Nairobi to Kamukunji Park on the outskirts of the city where they planted seven trees in honor of historical community leaders. This was the first \"Green Belt\" which was first known as the \"Save the Land Harambee\" and then became the [[Green Belt Movement]].<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 130\u2013132.</ref> Maathai encouraged the women of Kenya to plant tree nurseries throughout the country, searching nearby forests for seeds to grow trees native to the area.

After a lengthy separation, Mwangi filed for divorce in 1979. Mwangi was said to have believed Wangari was \"too strong-minded for a woman\" and that he was \"unable to control her\". In addition to naming her as \"cruel\" in court filings, he publicly accused her of adultery with another Member of Parliament,<ref name=\"NYTNairobiJournal\">Perlez, Jane, [http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/06/world/nairobi-journal-skyscraper-s-enemy-draws-a-daily-dose-of-scorn.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm \"Nairobi Journal; Skyscraper's Enemy Draws a Daily Dose of Scorn\"], ''New York Times'', 6 December 1989.

Shortly after the trial, in an interview with Viva magazine, Maathai referred to the judge as either incompetent or corrupt.<ref name=\"NYTNairobiJournal\"/> The interview later led the judge to charge Maathai with contempt of court. She was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail. After three days in Lang'ata Women's Prison in Nairobi, her lawyer formulated a statement which the court found sufficient for her release. Shortly after the divorce, her former husband sent a letter via his lawyer demanding that Maathai drop his surname. She chose to add an extra \"a\" instead.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7939651 \"Conservation and Feminism: Africa's Greenheart.\"] ''The Economist'', 21 September 2006.</ref><ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 139\u2013151.</ref>\n\nThe divorce had been costly, and with lawyers' fees and the loss of her husband's income, Maathai found it difficult to provide for herself and her children on her university wages. An opportunity arose to work for the [[Economic Commission for Africa]] through the [[United Nations Development Programme]]. As this job required extended travel throughout Africa and was based primarily in [[Lusaka, Zambia]], she was unable to bring her children with her. Maathai chose to send them to her ex-husband and take the job. While she visited them regularly, they lived with their father until 1985.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 151\u2013155.</ref>\n\n===1979\u20131982: Political problems===\nIn 1979, shortly after the divorce, Maathai ran for the position of chairperson of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK), an [[umbrella organization]] consisting of many women's organizations in the country. The newly elected [[President of Kenya]], [[Daniel arap Moi]], tried to limit the amount of influence those of the Kikuyu ethnicity held in the country, including in volunteer civic organizations such as the NCWK. She lost this election by three votes, but was overwhelmingly chosen to be the vice-chairman of the organization. The following year, Maathai again ran for chairman of the NCWK. Again she was opposed, she believes, by the government. When it became apparent that Maathai was going to win the election, [[Maendeleo Ya Wanawake]], a member organization which represented a majority of Kenya's rural women and whose leader was close to Arap Moi, withdrew from the NCWK. Maathai was then elected chairman of the NCWK unopposed. However, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake came to receive a majority of the financial support for women's programs in the country, and NCWK was left virtually bankrupt. Future funding was much more difficult to come by, but the NCWK survived by increasing its focus on the environment and making its presence and work known. Maathai continued to be reelected to serve as chairman of the organization every year until she  retired from the position in 1987.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 156\u2013160.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=It soon became obvious that politics was at play again.

As required by law, she resigned her position with the University of Nairobi to campaign for office. The courts decided that she was ineligible to run for office because she had not re-registered to vote in the last presidential election in 1979. Maathai believed this to be false and illegal, and brought the matter to court. The court was to meet at nine in the morning, and if she received a favourable ruling, was required to present her candidacy papers in Nyeri by three in the afternoon that day. The judge disqualified her from running on a technicality. {{Clarify|date=May 2013}} When she requested her job back, she was denied. As she lived in university housing and was no longer a staff member, she was evicted.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 160\u2013163.</ref>\n\n===Green Belt Movement===\n{{main|Green Belt Movement}}\nMaathai moved into a small home she had purchased years before, and focused on the NCWK while she searched for employment. In the course of her work through the NCWK, she was approached by [[Wilhelm Elsrud]], executive director of the [[Norwegian Forestry Society]]. He wished to partner with the Green Belt Movement and offered her the position of coordinator. Employed again, Maathai poured her efforts into the Green Belt Movement. Along with the partnership for the Norwegian Forestry Society, the movement had also received \"seed money\" from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Women. These funds allowed for the expansion of the movement, for hiring additional employees to oversee the operations, and for continuing to pay a small stipend to the women who planted seedlings throughout the country. It allowed her to refine the operations of the movement, paying a small stipend to the women's husbands and sons who were literate and able to keep accurate records of seedlings planted.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 168\u2013173.</ref>{{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=Although I was a highly educated woman, it did not seem odd to me to work with my hands, often with my knees on the ground, alongside rural woman.

During the conference, Maathai arranged seminars and presentations to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and [[Helvi Sipil\u00e4]], the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement and led to the movement's establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya over the next three years to learn how to set up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honoured with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairman of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organization.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 175\u2013179.</ref>\n\n===Government intervention===\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, the Kenyan government came down against Maathai and the Green Belt Movement. The single-party regime opposed many of the movement's positions regarding democratic rights. The government invoked a colonial-era law prohibiting groups of more than nine people from meeting without a government license. In 1988, the Green Belt Movement carried out pro-democracy activities such as registering voters for the election and pressing for constitutional reform and freedom of expression. The government carried out electoral fraud in the elections to maintain power, according to Maathai.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 180\u2013183.</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, Maathai learned of a plan to construct the 60-story Kenya Times Media Trust Complex in [[Uhuru Park]]. The complex was intended to house the headquarters of KANU, the Kenya Times newspaper, a trading centre, offices, an auditorium, galleries, shopping malls, and parking space for 2,000 cars. The plan also included a large statue of President Daniel arap Moi. Maathai wrote many letters in protest to, among others, the ''Kenya Times'', the Office of the President, the Nairobi city commission, the provincial commissioner, the minister for environment and natural resources, the executive directors of UNEP and the Environment Liaison Centre International, the executive director of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the ministry of public works, and the permanent secretary in the department of international security and administration all received letters. She wrote to Sir John Johnson, the British high commissioner in Nairobi, urging him to intervene with Robert Maxwell, a major shareholder in the project, equating the construction of a tower in Uhuru Park to such construction in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] or [[Central Park]] and maintaining that it could not be tolerated.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 184\u2013188.</ref>\n{{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=When I see Uhuru Park and contemplate its meaning, I feel compelled to fight for it so that my grandchildren may share that dream and that joy of freedom as they one day walk there.|source=Wangari Muta Maathai \u2013 ''Unbowed'', p. 192.}}\nThe government refused to respond to her inquiries and protests, instead responding through the media that Maathai was \"a crazy woman\"; that denying the project in Uhuru Park would take more than a small portion of public park land; and proclaiming the project as a \"fine and magnificent work of architecture\" opposed by only the \"ignorant few.\" On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai's actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organizations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organization and its members \"a bunch of divorcees\". They suggested that if Maathai was so comfortable writing to Europeans, perhaps she should go live in Europe.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 190\u2013193.</ref>\n\nDespite Maathai's protests, as well as popular protest growing throughout the city, ground was broken at Uhuru Park for construction of the complex on 15 November 1989. Maathai sought an injunction in the Kenya High Court to halt construction, but the case was thrown out on 11 December. In his first public comments pertaining to the project, President Daniel arap Moi stated that those who opposed the project had \"insects in their heads\". On 12 December, in Uhuru Park, during a speech celebrating independence from the British, President Moi suggested Maathai be a proper woman in the African tradition and respect men and be quiet.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 196.</ref> She was forced by the government to vacate her office, and the Green Belt Movement was moved into her home. The government then audited the Green Belt Movement in an apparent attempt to shut it down. Despite all this, her protests, the government's response \u2013 and the media coverage it garnered \u2013 led foreign investors to cancel the project in January 1990.<ref name=\"Ecologist\">''The Ecologist'' (1 April 2001).

Maathai's name was on the list. The pro-democracy group, known as the [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy\u2013Kenya|Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]] (FORD), presented its information to the media, calling for a general election. Later that day, Maathai received a warning that one of their members had been arrested. Maathai decided to barricade herself in her home. Shortly thereafter, police arrived and surrounded the house. She was besieged for three days before police cut through the bars she had installed on her windows, came in, and arrested her. She and the other pro-democracy activists who had been arrested were charged with spreading malicious rumours, sedition and treason. After a day and a half in jail, they were brought to a hearing and released on bail. A variety of international organizations and eight senators (including [[Al Gore]] and [[Edward M. Kennedy]]) put pressure on the Kenyan government to substantiate the charges against the pro-democracy activists or risk damaging relations with the United States. In November 1992, the Kenyan government dropped the charges.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 208\u2013215.</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 1992, while released on bail, Maathai and others took part in a [[hunger strike]] in a corner of Uhuru Park, which they labelled Freedom Corner, to pressure the government to release [[political prisoner]]s. After four days of hunger strike, on 3 March 1992, the police forcibly removed the protesters.

The protest there continued, with Maathai contributing frequently, until early 1993, when the prisoners were finally released.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 217\u2013225.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Maathai was recognized with various awards internationally, but the Kenyan government did not appreciate her work. In 1991 she received the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in San Francisco and the [[Hunger Project]]'s Africa Prize for Leadership in London. [[CNN]] aired a three-minute segment about the Goldman prize, but when it aired in Kenya, that segment was cut out. In June 1992, during the long protest at Uhuru Park, both Maathai and President arap Moi travelled to [[Rio de Janeiro]] for the UN Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]). The Kenyan government accused Maathai of inciting women and encouraging them to strip at Freedom Corner, urging that she not be allowed to speak at the summit. Despite this, Maathai was chosen to be a chief spokesperson at the summit.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp.  226\u2013228.</ref>\n\n===Push for democracy===\nDuring the first multi-party [[Kenyan general election, 1992|election of Kenya, in 1992]], Maathai strove to unite the opposition and fair elections in Kenya. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) had fractured into [[FORD-Kenya]] (led by [[Oginga Odinga]]) and [[FORD-Asili]] (led by [[Kenneth Matiba]]); former [[Vice-President of Kenya|vice president]] [[Mwai Kibaki]] had left the ruling [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) party, and formed the [[Democratic Party (Kenya)|Democratic Party]]. Maathai and many others believed such a fractured opposition would lead to KANU's retaining control of the country, so they formed the Middle Ground Group in an effort to unite the opposition. Maathai was chosen to serve as its chairperson. Also during the election, Maathai and like-minded opposition members formed the Movement for Free and Fair Elections. Despite their efforts, the opposition did not unite, and the ruling KANU party used intimidation and state-held media to win the election, retaining control of parliament.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 230\u2013235.</ref>\n{{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=It is often difficult to describe to those who live in a free society what life is like in an authoritarian regime. You don't know who to trust. You worry that you, your family, or your friends will be arrested and jailed without due process. The fear of political violence or death, whether through direct assassinations or targeted \"accidents\", is constant. Such was the case in Kenya, especially during the 1990s.|source=Wangari Muta Maathai \u2013 ''Unbowed'', p. 206.}}\n\nThe following year, ethnic clashes occurred throughout Kenya. Maathai believed they were incited by the government, who had warned of stark consequences to [[multi-party democracy]]. Maathai travelled with friends and the press to areas of violence in order to encourage them to cease fighting. With the Green Belt Movement she planted \"trees of peace\", but before long her actions were opposed by the government. The conflict areas were labeled as \"no go zones\", and in February 1993 the president claimed that Maathai had masterminded a distribution of leaflets inciting [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyus]] to attack [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjins]]. After her friend and supporter Dr. Makanga was kidnapped, Maathai chose to go into hiding. While in hiding, Maathai was invited to a meeting in Tokyo of the [[Green Cross International]], an environmental organization recently founded by former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. When Maathai responded that she could not attend as she did not believe the government would allow her to leave the country and she was in hiding, Gorbachev pressured the government of Kenya to allow her to travel freely. President arap Moi denied limiting her travel, and she was allowed to leave the country, although too late for the meeting in Tokyo. Maathai was again recognized internationally, and she flew to [[Scotland]] to receive the Edinburgh Medal in April 1993. In May she went to Chicago to receive the [[Jane Addams]] International Women's Leadership Award, and in June she attended the UN's [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 235\u2013252.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Kenyan general election, 1997|elections of 1997]], Maathai again wished to unite the opposition in order to defeat the ruling party. In November, less than two months before the election, she decided to run for parliament and for president as a candidate of the [[Mazingira Green Party of Kenya|Liberal Party]]. Her intentions were widely questioned in the press; many believed she should simply stick to running the Green Belt Movement and stay out of politics. On the day of the election, a rumour that Maathai had withdrawn from the election and endorsed another candidate was printed in the media. Maathai garnered few votes and lost the election.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 254\u2013259.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1998, Maathai learned of a government plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, and give it to political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters to the government and the press. She went with the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest. On 8 January 1999, a group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai's supporters, and the event provoked international outrage.<ref name=\"Ecologist\"/><ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 261\u2013270.</ref> Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police. Protests continued until 16 August 1999, when the president announced that he was banning all allocation of public land.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 270\u2013271.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the government again planned to take public forest land and give it to its supporters. While protesting this and collecting [[petition]] signatures on 7 March 2001, in Wang'uru village near [[Mount Kenya]], Maathai was again arrested. The following day, following international and popular protest at her arrest, she was released without being charged. On 7 July 2001, shortly after planting trees at Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park in Nairobi to commemorate [[Saba Saba Day]], Maathai was again arrested. Later that evening, she was again released without being charged.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 280\u2013284.</ref> In January 2002, Maathai returned to teaching as the Dorothy McCluskey Visiting Fellow for Conservation at the [[Yale University]]'s [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies|School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]].

On 27 December 2002, the Rainbow Coalition defeated the ruling party [[Kenya African National Union]], and in [[Tetu Constituency]] Maathai won with an overwhelming 98% of the vote.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 286\u2013289.</ref> In January 2003, she was appointed Assistant Minister in the Ministry for Environment and Natural Resources and served in that capacity until November 2005.<ref name=\"UNCCD\"/> She founded the [[Mazingira Green Party of Kenya]] in 2003 to allow candidates to run on a platform of conservation as embodied by the Green Belt Movement.

[[cytogenetics|cytogeneticist]] who was awarded the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. McClintock received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[botany]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1927. There she started her career as the leader in the development of [[maize]] [[cytogenetic]]s, the focus of her research for the rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied [[chromosome]]s and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of [[genetic recombination]] by [[chromosomal crossover|crossing-over]] during [[meiosis]]\u2014a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first [[genetic linkage|genetic map]] for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the [[telomere]] and [[centromere]], regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of [[genetic information]]. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1944.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock discovered [[transposon|transposition]] and used it to demonstrate that [[gene]]s are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.\n\nLater, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and [[ethnobotany]] of maize [[race (biology)|race]]s from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and [[regulation of gene expression|genetic regulation]] that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic [[transposon|transposition]]; she is the only woman to receive an unshared [[Nobel Prize]] in that category.{{sfn|Nobel Prize}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:McClintock family 1907.jpg|thumb|300px|McClintock children, from left to right: Mignon, Malcolm Rider \"Tom\", Barbara and Marjorie]]\n[[File:McClintock family.jpg|thumb|300px|McClintock family, from left to right: Mignon, Tom, Barbara, Marjorie and Sara (at the piano)]]\nBarbara McClintock was born Eleanor McClintock on June 16, 1902 in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]],{{sfn|Lamberts|2000}}{{sfn|Comfort|2001|pp=19\u201322}} the third of four children born to physician Thomas Henry McClintock and Sara Handy McClintock.

This particular part of her work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using [[carmine]] staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed for the first time the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the [[microspore]] as opposed to the [[root cap|root tip]].{{sfn|Kass|Bonneuil|2004|pp=91\u2013118}}{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=217}} By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to [[genetic linkage|link]] specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=212}} Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' paper on the characterization of [[polyploidy|triploid]] maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.{{sfn|Rhoades}}\n\nIn 1930, McClintock was the first person to describe the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during [[meiosis]]. The following year, McClintock and Creighton proved the link between [[chromosomal crossover]] during meiosis and the recombination of genetic traits.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=212}}{{sfn|Coe|Kass|2005|pp=6641\u20136656}} They observed how the recombination of chromosomes seen under a microscope correlated with new traits.{{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers \u2013 Cornell}}{{sfn|Creighton|McClintock|1931|pp=492\u2013497}} Until this point, it had only been hypothesized that [[genetic recombination]] could occur during meiosis, although it had been shown genetically.{{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers \u2013 Cornell}} McClintock published the first genetic map for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9.{{sfn|McClintock|1931|pp=485\u2013491}}  This information provided necessary data for the crossing-over study she published with Creighton;{{sfn|Coe|Kass|2005|pp=6641\u20136656}} they also showed that crossing-over occurs in [[sister chromatids]] as well as [[homologous chromosomes]].{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=218}} In 1938, she produced a cytogenetic analysis of the [[centromere]], describing the organization and function of the centromere, as well as the fact that it can divide.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=212}}\n\nMcClintock's breakthrough publications, and support from her colleagues, led to her being awarded several postdoctoral fellowships from the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]. This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the [[University of Missouri]], and the [[California Institute of Technology]], where she worked with E. G. Anderson.{{sfn|Kass|2003|pp=1251\u20131260}}{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=218}} During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked at Missouri with geneticist [[Lewis Stadler]], who introduced her to the use of [[X-ray]]s as a [[mutagen]]. Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics. Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified [[ring chromosome]]s, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=219}} From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused [[variegation]] in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=212}} During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the [[nucleolus organizer region]] on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the [[nucleolus]].{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=212}}{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=218}}{{sfn|McClintock|1934|p=294\u2013328}} In 1933, she established that cells can be damaged when [[Non-homologous end joining|nonhomologous recombination]] occurs.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=212}}{{sfn|Green|1959|p=1243}} During this same period, McClintock hypothesized that the tips of chromosomes are protected by [[telomere]]s.{{sfn|CSHL Biography}}\n\nMcClintock received a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] that made possible six months of training in Germany during 1933 and 1934.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=219}} She had planned to work with [[Curt Stern (geneticist)|Curt Stern]], who had demonstrated crossing-over in ''[[Drosophila]]'' just weeks after McClintock and Creighton had done so; however, Stern emigrated to the United States.

McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of [[mitosis]], she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome [[DNA replication|replication]].{{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers \u2013 Missouri}} In the [[anaphase]] of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the [[interphase]] of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm.{{sfn|McClintock|1941|pp=234\u2013282}} This [[Breakage-fusion-bridge cycle|breakage\u2013rejoining\u2013bridge cycle]] was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons.{{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers \u2013 Missouri}} First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in [[cancer]] research today.{{sfn|Selvarajah et al. 2006}}\n\nAlthough her research was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was not satisfied with her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions.{{sfn|Keller|1983}} In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, \"I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, there is nothing more for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me.\"{{sfn|McClintock|1940}}{{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers \u2013 Missouri}} Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university.{{sfn|Kass|2003|pp=1251\u20131260}}{{sfn|Kass|2005|p=52\u201371}} McClintock believed she would not gain [[tenure]] at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942.{{sfn|Comfort|2002|p=440}} Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for [[Caltech]], as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.{{sfn|Kass|2003|pp=1251\u20131260}}\n\nIn early 1941, she took a leave of absence from Missouri in hopes of finding a position elsewhere. She accepted a visiting Professorship at [[Columbia University]], where her former Cornell colleague [[Marcus Rhoades]] was a professor. Rhoades also offered to share his research field at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island. In December 1941, she was offered a research position by [[Milislav Demerec]], the newly appointed acting director of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]'s Department of Genetics [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]]; McClintock accepted his invitation despite her qualms and became a permanent member of the faculty.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=221}}\n\n==Cold Spring Harbor==\nAfter her year-long temporary appointment, McClintock accepted a full-time research position at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]]. There, she was highly productive and continued her work with the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, using it to substitute for X-rays as a tool for mapping new genes. In 1944, in recognition of her prominence in the field of genetics during this period, McClintock was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]\u2014only the third woman to be elected. That same year, she became the first female president of the [[Genetics Society of America]];{{sfn|Lamberts|2000}} she was elected its vice-president in 1939.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=220}} In 1944 she undertook a cytogenetic analysis of ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' at the suggestion of George Beadle, who used the fungus to demonstrate the one gene\u2013one enzyme relationship. He invited her to [[Stanford University|Stanford]] to undertake the study. She successfully described the number of chromosomes, or [[karyotype]], of ''N. crassa'' and described the entire life cycle of the species. Beadle said \"Barbara, in two months at Stanford, did more to clean up the cytology of Neurospora than all other cytological geneticists had done in all previous time on all forms of mold.\" {{sfn|Keller|1983|p=114}} ''N. crassa'' has since become a [[model organism|model species]] for classical genetic analysis.{{sfn|McClintock|1945|pp=671\u2013678}}{{sfn|Klug|Cummings|Spencer|Palladino|2012|pp=128\u2013130}}\n\n===Discovery of controlling elements===\n[[File:Corn mosaic.jpg|thumb|The relationship of ''Ac/Ds'' in the control of the elements and mosaic color of maize. The seed in 10 is colorless, there is no ''Ac'' element present and ''Ds'' inhibits the synthesis of colored pigments called [[anthocyanin]]s. In 11 to 13, one copy of ''Ac'' is present. ''Ds'' can move and some anthocyanin is produced, creating a mosaic pattern. In the kernel in panel 14 there are two ''Ac'' elements and in 15 there are three.<!-- FAIR USE of File:Corn mosaic.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Corn mosaic.jpg for rationale -->]]\n\nIn the summer of 1944 at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], McClintock began systematic studies on the mechanisms of the [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] color patterns of maize seed and the unstable [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]] of this mosaicism. She identified two new [[dominance relationship|dominant]] and interacting genetic loci that she named ''Dissociator'' (''Ds'') and ''Activator'' (''Ac''). She found that the ''Dissociator'' did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the ''Activator'' was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both ''Dissociator'' and ''Activator'' could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.{{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers \u2013 Cold Spring Harbor}}{{sfn|Comfort|1999|pp=133\u2013162}}{{sfn|Goodier|Kazazian|2008|pp=23\u201325}}{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=223}}\n\nShe observed the effects of the transposition of ''Ac'' and ''Ds'' by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described the relationship between the two [[locus (genetics)|loci]] through intricate microscopic analysis.{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences 2005}} She concluded that ''Ac'' controls the transposition of the ''Ds'' from chromosome&nbsp;9, and that the movement of ''Ds'' is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=223}} When ''Ds'' moves, the [[aleurone]]-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the ''Ds'' and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells.{{sfn|Klug|Cummings|Spencer|Palladino|2012|p=395}} The transposition of ''Ds'' in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of ''Ds'' is determined by the number of ''Ac'' copies in the cell.{{sfn|Pray|Zhaurova|2008}}\n\nBetween 1948 and 1950, she developed a theory by which these mobile elements regulated the genes by inhibiting or modulating their action. She referred to ''Dissociator'' and ''Activator'' as \"controlling units\"\u2014later, as \"controlling elements\"\u2014to distinguish them from genes. She hypothesized that [[gene regulation]] could explain how complex multicellular organisms made of cells with identical [[genome]]s have cells of different function.{{sfn|Pray|Zhaurova|2008}} McClintock's discovery challenged the concept of the genome as a static set of instructions passed between generations.{{sfn|Lamberts|2000}} In 1950, she reported her work on ''Ac/Ds'' and her ideas about gene regulation in a paper entitled \"The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize\" published in the journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]''. In summer 1951, when she reported her work on the origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize at the annual symposium at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, presenting a paper of the same name. The paper delved into the instability caused by ''Dc'' and ''As'' or just ''As'' in four genes, along with the tendency of those genes to unpredictably revert to the wild phenotype. She also identified \"families\" of transposons, which did not interact with one another.{{sfn|Lamberts|2000}}{{sfn|McClintock|1950|pp=344\u2013355}}{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=223}}\n\nHer work on controlling elements and gene regulation was conceptually difficult and was not immediately understood or accepted by her contemporaries; she described the reception of her research as \"puzzlement, even hostility\".{{sfn|McClintock|1987}}{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=223}} Nevertheless, McClintock continued to develop her ideas on controlling elements. She published a paper in ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' in 1953, where she presented all her statistical data, and undertook lecture tours to universities throughout the 1950s to speak about her work.{{sfn|McClintock|1953|pp=579\u2013599}} She continued to investigate the problem and identified a new element that she called ''Suppressor-mutator'' (''Spm''), which, although similar to ''Ac/Ds'', acts in a more complex manner. Like ''Ac/Ds'', some versions could transpose on their own and some could not; unlike ''Ac/Ds'', when present, it fully suppressed the expression of mutant genes when they normally would not be entirely suppressed.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=224}} Based on the reactions of other scientists to her work, McClintock felt she risked alienating the scientific mainstream, and from 1953 stopped publishing accounts of her research on controlling elements.{{sfn|Lamberts|2000}}{{sfn|Comfort|1999|pp=133\u2013162}}\n\n===The origins of maize===\n[[File:Corn and microscope.jpg|thumb|McClintock's microscope and ears of corn on exhibition at the [[National Museum of Natural History]]]]\n\nIn 1957, McClintock received funding from the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to start research on indigenous strains of maize in [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. She was interested in studying the [[evolution]] of maize through chromosomal changes,{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=226}} and being in South America would allow her to work on a larger scale. McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various [[race (biology)|races]] of maize.{{sfn|CSHL Biography}} After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study ''The Chromosomal Constitution of Races of Maize'', leaving their mark on [[paleobotany]], [[ethnobotany]], and [[evolutionary biology]].{{sfn|The Barbara McClintock Papers \u2013 Origins of Maize}}\n\n===Rediscovery of McClintock's controlling elements===\nMcClintock officially retired from her position at the Carnegie Institution in 1967,{{sfn|Lamberts|2000}} and was made a Distinguished Service Member of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=221}} This honor allowed her to continue working with graduate students and colleagues in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as ''scientist emerita''; she lived in the town.{{sfn|Kolata|1992}} In reference to her decision 20 years earlier to stop publishing detailed accounts of her work on controlling elements, she wrote in 1973:\n\n<blockquote>Over the years I have found that it is difficult if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.{{sfn|McClintock|1973}}</blockquote>\n\nThe importance of McClintock's contributions was revealed in the 1960s, when the work of French geneticists [[Francois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] described the genetic regulation of the [[lac operon|''lac'' operon]], a concept she had demonstrated with ''Ac/Ds'' in 1951. Following Jacob and Monod's 1961 ''Journal of Molecular Biology'' paper \"Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins\", McClintock wrote an article for ''[[American Naturalist]]'' comparing the ''lac'' operon and her work on controlling elements in maize.{{sfn|McClintock|1961|pp=265\u201377}}{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=224}} McClintock's contribution to biology is still not widely acknowledged as amounting to the discovery of genetic regulation.{{sfn|Comfort|1999|pp=133\u2013162}}\n\nMcClintock was widely credited with discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered the process in bacteria, yeast, and [[bacteriophage]]s in the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=213}} During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition.{{sfn|Fedoroff|1995|p=227}} In the 1970s, ''Ac'' and ''Ds'' were [[cloning|cloned]] by other scientists and were shown to be [[transposon|Class II transposons]]. ''Ac'' is a complete transposon that can produce a functional [[transposase]], which is required for the element to move within the genome. ''Ds'' has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, ''Ds'' cannot move in the absence of ''Ac''. ''Spm'' has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the [[breakage-fusion-bridge cycle]], and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution.{{sfn|Pray|2008}} McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, ''Ac/Ds'' is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.{{sfn|Jin|Duan|Zhang|Chen|2003}}\n\n==Honors and recognition==\nIn 1947, McClintock received the Achievement Award from the [[American Association of University Women]].

During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after [[Evelyn Fox Keller]]'s 1983 biography of her, ''A Feeling for the Organism,'' brought McClintock's story to the public. She remained a regular presence in the Cold Spring Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of junior scientists. An anthology of her 43 publications ''The Discovery and Characterization of Transposable Elements: The Collected Papers of Barbara McClintock'' was published in 1987.{{sfn|Washington Post}}\n\n==Later years==\nMcClintock spent her later years, post Nobel Prize, as a key leader and researcher in the field at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, New York.  McClintock died of natural causes in [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]], [[New York]], on September 2, 1992 at the age of 90; she never married or had children.{{sfn|Kolata|1992}}{{sfn|Washington Post}}\n\n==Legacy==\nSince her death, McClintock has been the subject of a biography by the science historian [[Nathaniel C. Comfort]]'s ''The Tangled Field: Barbara McClintock's Search for the Patterns of Genetic Control''. Comfort's biography contests some claims about McClintock, described as the \"McClintock Myth\", which he claims was perpetuated by the earlier biography by Keller. Keller's thesis was that McClintock was long ignored or met with derision because she was a woman working in the sciences. For example, when McClintock presented her findings that the genetics of maize did not conform to Mendelian distributions, geneticist [[Sewall Wright]] expressed the belief that she did not understand the underlying mathematics of her work, a belief he had expressed towards other women at the time.{{sfn|Esther Lederberg}} In addition, geneticist Lotte Auerbach recounted that [[Joshua Lederberg]] returned from a visit to McClintock's lab with the remark: 'By God, that woman is either crazy or a genius.' \" As Auerbach tells it, McClintock had thrown Lederberg and his colleagues out after half an hour 'because of their arrogance. She was intolerant of arrogance&nbsp;... She felt she had crossed a desert alone and no one had followed her.'\"{{sfn|Keller|1983|p=142}}{{sfn|Esther Lederberg Colleagues}}\n\nComfort, however, asserts that McClintock was well regarded by her professional peers, even in the early years of her career.{{sfn|Comfort|1999}} Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's ''Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist'', Deborah Heiligman's ''Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field'' and Mary Kittredge's ''Barbara McClintock''. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, ''Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics'', provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2006}}\n\nOn 4 May 2005, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued the \"American Scientists\" commemorative [[postage stamp]] series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations.  The scientists depicted were Barbara McClintock, [[John von Neumann]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[Richard Feynman]]. McClintock was also featured in a 1989 four-stamp issue from [[Sweden]] which illustrated the work of eight Nobel Prize-winning geneticists. A small building at Cornell University and a laboratory building at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory were named for her. A street has been named after her in the new \"[[Adlershof#Development|Adlershof Development Society]]\" science park in [[Berlin]].{{sfn|Berlin}}\n\nSome of McClintock's personality and scientific achievements were referred to in [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s 2011 novel ''[[The Marriage Plot]],'' which tells the story of a [[yeast]] geneticist named Leonard who suffers from [[bipolar disorder]]. He works at a laboratory loosely based on Cold Spring Harbor. The character reminiscent of McClintock is a reclusive geneticist at the fictional laboratory, who makes the same discoveries as her factual counterpart.{{sfn|Kolata|2012}}\n\n==Key publications==\n* {{Cite journal \n| last1 = McClintock | first1 = B. \n| title = A Cytological and Genetical Study of Triploid Maize \n| journal = Genetics \n| volume = 14 \n| issue = 2 \n| pages = 180\u2013222 \n| year = 1929 \n| pmid = 17246573 \n| pmc = 1201029\n}}\n* {{Cite journal \n| last1 = Creighton | first1 = H.

Mench\u00fa has dedicated her life to publicizing the rights of Guatemala's indigenous feminists during and after the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] (1960\u20131996), and to promoting [[indigenous rights]] in the country. She received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1992 and the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in 1998. She is the subject of the testimonial biography ''I, Rigoberta Mench\u00fa'' (1983) and the author of the autobiographical work, ''Crossing Borders''. Mench\u00fa is a [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador]]. She has also become a figure in indigenous political parties and ran for President of Guatemala in 2007 and 2011.\n\n== Personal life ==\nRigoberta Mench\u00fa was born to a poor indigenous family of K'iche' descent near [[Laj Chimel]], a small town in the north-central Guatemalan province of [[Quich\u00e9 Department|El Quich\u00e9]]. Mench\u00fa received a primary-school education as a student at several Catholic boarding schools.\n\nIn 1981, Rigoberta Mench\u00fa was exiled and escaped to Mexico. She found refuge in the home of a Catholic bishop in Chiapas. \n\nIn 1995, Mench\u00fa married Angel Canil, a Guatemalan. They have a son, Mash Nahual J\u2019a (\"Spirit of Water\".)<ref>Irwin Abrams, ''The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates: An Illustrated Biographical History,'' Watson Publishing International, 2001, 296.</ref>\n\n== Activism ==\nAfter leaving school, Mench\u00fa worked as an activist campaigning against [[human rights]] violations committed by the [[Guatemalan armed forces]] during the country's civil war, which lasted from 1960 to 1996. Her father, Vicente Mench\u00fa, was a member of the guerrilla movement [[Guerrilla Army of the Poor]] and died in 1980 during the [[Burning of the Spanish Embassy]] after being captured and tortured for his role in organizing against abusive landowners.\n\nWhile in exile in Mexico, she continued to organize resistance to oppression in Guatemala and the struggle for Indian rights by co-founding the United Republic of Guatemalan Opposition. Tens of thousands of people, mostly Mayan Indians, fled to Mexico from 1982 to 1984 at the height of Guatemala's 36-year civil war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/3b72550b2a.html|title=Mench\u00fa Tum, Rigoberta|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|website=UNHCR|access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, she narrated a book about her life to Venezuelan author and anthropologist [[Elizabeth Burgos]], \"Me llamo Rigoberta Mench\u00fa y as\u00ed me naci\u00f3 la conciencia\" (My Name is Rigoberta Mench\u00fa and this is how my Conscience was Born), which was translated into five other languages including English and French. The book made her an international icon at the time of the ongoing conflict in Guatemala.<ref name=\"nobel\" />\n<!-- preparation by the UN in its [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] -->\n\nSince the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] ended, Mench\u00fa has campaigned to have members of the Guatemalan political and military establishment tried in Spanish courts. In 1999 she filed a complaint before a court in Spain because prosecutions of crimes committed during the civil war are practically impossible in Guatemala. These attempts stalled as the Spanish courts determined that the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted all possibility of seeking justice through the legal system of Guatemala. On 23 December 2006, Spain called for the [[extradition]] from Guatemala of seven former members of Guatemala's government on charges of [[genocide]] and [[torture]]. These include former military rulers [[Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt]] and [[\u00d3scar Humberto Mej\u00eda Victores|\u00d3scar Mej\u00eda]]. Spain's highest court ruled that cases of genocide committed abroad could be judged in Spain, even if no Spanish citizens have been involved. In addition to the deaths of Spanish citizens, the most serious charges include genocide against the [[Maya people]] of Guatemala.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6205327.stm|title=Spain seeks Guatemalan ex-rulers|date=2006-12-23|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, a Guatemalan court convicted the commander of a former police investigations unit of murder, attempted murder and crimes against humanity for his role in the embassy attack, in which Mench\u00fa's father died.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grandin|first1=Greg|title=Rigoberta Mench\u00fa Vindicated|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/195593/rigoberta-menchu-vindicated#|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nMench\u00fa has become involved in the Indian [[pharmaceutical]] industry as president of the company [[Salud para Todos]] (\"Health for All\") and the company \"Farmacias Similares\", with the goal of offering low-cost [[generic medicine]]s.<ref name=all>[http://www.allbusiness.com/caribbean/750825-1.html GUATEMALA: RIGOBERTA MENCHU STEPS BEYOND TRADITION TO MOVE INDIGENOUS AGENDA] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}</ref> She served as presidential goodwill ambassador for the 1996 peace accords.<ref name=all/> That same year she received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award in Boston.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peaceabbey.org/2015/05/recipients-of-the-courage-of-conscience-award/|title=Recipients of the Courage of Conscience Award {{!}} The Peace Abbey FoundationThe Peace Abbey Foundation|website=www.peaceabbey.org|access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Mench\u00fa was one of the founders of the [[Nobel Women's Initiative]] along with sister Nobel Peace Laureates [[Jody Williams]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], [[Wangari Maathai]], [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]] and [[Mairead Corrigan Maguire]].

Stoll claimed that Mench\u00fa changed some elements of her life, family and village to meet the publicity needs of the guerrilla movement, which she joined as a political ''comadre'' after her parents were assassinated. The controversy caused by Stoll's book received widespread coverage in the US press of the time.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Rohter\n  | first = Larry\n  | title = TARNISHED LAUREATE: A special report.; Nobel Winner Finds Her Story Challenged\n  | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n  | date = 15 December 1998\n  | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/15/world/tarnished-laureate-a-special-report-nobel-winner-finds-her-story-challenged.html?scp=7&sq=rigoberta%20menchu&st=cse&pagewanted=1\n  | postscript = <!--none-->}}\n</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Greg Grandin]] writes that Stoll's research on the [[Guatemalan revolution]] is mostly wrong, but states that \"two of Stoll's charges concerning Mench\u00fa's life do have merit.\"<ref name=\"Grandin It Was Heaven 3\">Grandin, Greg.

She was the first Latin American author to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], which she did in 1945 \"for her lyric poetry which, inspired by powerful emotions, has made her name a symbol of the idealistic aspirations of the entire Latin American world\". Some central themes in her poems are nature, betrayal, love, a mother's love, sorrow and recovery, travel, and Latin American identity as formed from a mixture of Native American and European influences. Her portrait also appears on the 5,000 Chilean peso bank note.\n\n==Early life==\n\nMistral was born in [[Vicu\u00f1a, Chile]], but was raised in the small [[Andes|Andean]] village of Montegrande, where she attended a [[primary school]] taught by her older sister, Emelina Molina. She respected her sister greatly, despite the many financial problems that Emelina brought her in later years. Her father, Juan Ger\u00f3nimo Godoy Villanueva, was also a schoolteacher. He abandoned the family before she was three years old, and died, long since estranged from the family, in 1911. Throughout her early years she was never far from poverty. By age fifteen, she was supporting herself and her mother, Petronila Alcayaga, a seamstress, by working as a teacher's aide in the seaside town of Compa\u00f1ia Baja, near La Serena, Chile.\n\nIn 1904 Mistral published some early poems, such as ''Enso\u00f1aciones'' (\"Dreams\"), ''Carta \u00cdntima'' (\"Intimate Letter\") and ''Junto al Mar'' (\"By the Sea\"), in the local newspaper ''El Coquimbo: Diario Radical'', and ''La Voz de Elqui'' using a range of pseudonyms and variations on her civil name.\n\nProbably in about 1906, while working as a teacher, Mistral met Romelio Ureta, a railway worker, who killed himself in 1909. The profound effects of death were already in the poet's work; writing about his [[suicide]] led the poet to consider death and life more broadly than previous generations of Latin American poets. While Mistral had passionate friendships with various men and women, and these impacted her writings, she was secretive about her emotional life.\n\nAn important moment of formal recognition came on December 22, 1914, when Mistral was awarded first prize in a national literary contest ''[[Juegos Florales]]'' in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] (the capital of Chile), with the work ''[[Sonetos de la Muerte]]'' (Sonnets of Death). She had been using the pen name Gabriela Mistral since June 1908 for much of her writing. After winning the ''[[Juegos Florales]]'' she infrequently used her given name of Lucila Godoy for her publications. She formed her pseudonym from the names of two of her favorite poets, [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]] or, as another story has it, from a composite of the Archangel Gabriel and the Mistral wind of Provence.\n\n==Career as an educator==\n\n[[File:GabrielaMistral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Gabriela Mistral during her youth]]\nMistral's meteoric rise in Chile's national school system plays out against the complex politics of Chile in the first two decades of the 20th century. In her adolescence, the need for teachers was so great, and the number of trained teachers was so small, especially in the rural areas, that anyone who was willing could find work as a teacher. Access to good schools was difficult, however, and the young woman lacked the political and social connections necessary to attend the Normal School: She was turned down, without explanation, in 1907. She later identified the obstacle to her entry as the school's chaplain, Father Ignacio Munizaga, who was aware of her publications in the local newspapers, her advocacy of liberalizing education and giving greater access to the schools to all social classes.\n\nAlthough her formal education had ended by 1900, she was able to get work as a teacher thanks to her older sister, Emelina, who had likewise begun as a teacher's aide and was responsible for much of the poet's early education. The poet was able to rise from one post to another because of her publications in local and national newspapers and magazines. Her willingness to move was also a factor. Between the years 1906 and 1912 she had taught, successively, in three schools near [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]], then in [[Barrancas, Pichilemu|Barrancas]], then [[Traigu\u00e9n]] in 1910, and in [[Antofagasta, Chile|Antofagasta]] in the desert north, in 1911. By 1912 she had moved to work in a liceo, or high school, in [[Los Andes, Chile|Los Andes]], where she stayed for six years and often visited Santiago. In 1918 [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]], then Minister of Education, and a future president of Chile, promoted her appointment to direct a liceo in [[Punta Arenas]]. She moved on to [[Temuco]] in 1920, then to Santiago, where in 1921, she defeated a candidate connected with the Radical Party, Josefina Dey del Castillo to be named director of Santiago's Liceo #6, the newest and most prestigious girls' school in Chile.\nControversies over the nomination of Gabriela Mistral to the highly coveted post in Santiago were among the factors that made her decide to accept an invitation to work in [[Mexico]] in 1922, with that country's [[Secretariat of Public Education|Minister of Education]], [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]]. He had her join in the nation's plan to reform libraries and schools, to start a national education system. That year she published ''Desolaci\u00f3n'' in New York, which further promoted the international acclaim she had already been receiving thanks to her journalism and public speaking. A year later she published ''Lecturas para Mujeres'' (Readings for Women), a text in prose and verse that celebrates Latin America from the broad, Americanist perspective developed in the wake of the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nFollowing almost two years in Mexico she traveled from Laredo, Texas to Washington D.C., where she addressed the [[Pan American Union]], went on to New York, then toured Europe: In Madrid she published ''Ternura'' (Tenderness), a collection of lullabies and rondas written for an audience of children, parents, and other poets. In early 1925 she returned to Chile, where she formally retired from the nation's education system, and received a pension. It wasn't a moment too soon: The legislature had just agreed to the demands of the teachers union, headed by Mistral's lifelong rival, Amanda Labarca Hubertson, that only university-trained teachers should be given posts in the schools. The [[University of Chile]] had granted her the academic title of Spanish Professor in 1923, although her formal education ended before she was 12 years old. Her [[autodidacticism]] was remarkable, a testimony to the flourishing culture of newspapers, magazines, and books in provincial Chile, as well as to her personal determination and verbal genius.\n\nPablo Neruda, internationally recognized poet, was one of her students.\n\n==International work and recognition==\n[[File:Gabriela Mistral-01.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Gabriela during the 1950s.]]\nMistral's international stature made it highly unlikely that she would remain in Chile. In mid-1925 she was invited to represent Latin America in the newly formed Institute for Intellectual Cooperation of the [[League of Nations]]. With her relocation to France in early 1926 she was effectively an exile for the rest of her life. She made a living, at first, from journalism and then giving lectures in the [[United States]] and in [[Latin America]], including [[Puerto Rico]]. She variously toured [[the Caribbean]], [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Argentina]], among other places.\n\nMistral lived primarily in [[France]] and [[Italy]] between 1926 and 1932. During these years she worked for the League for Intellectual Cooperation of the [[League of Nations]], attending conferences of women and educators throughout Europe and occasionally in the Americas. She held a visiting professorship at [[Barnard College]] of [[Columbia University]] in 1930\u20131931, worked briefly at [[Middlebury College]] and [[Vassar College]] in 1931, and was warmly received at the [[University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras]], where she variously gave conferences or wrote, in 1931, 1932, and 1933.\n\nLike many Latin American artists and intellectuals, Mistral served as a consul from 1932 until her death, working in [[Naples]], [[Madrid]], [[Lisbon]], [[Nice, France|Nice]], [[Petr\u00f3polis]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Veracruz]],  [[Rapallo]], and [[New York, New York|New York]]. As consul in Madrid, she had occasional professional interactions with another Chilean consul and [[Nobel Prize]] recipient, [[Pablo Neruda]], and she was among the earlier writers to recognize the importance and originality of his work, which she had known while he was a teenager and she was school director in his hometown of Temuco.\n\nShe published hundreds of articles in magazines and newspapers throughout the Spanish-speaking world. Among her confidants were [[Eduardo Santos]], President of Colombia, all of the elected Presidents of Chile from 1922 to her death in 1957, Eduardo Frei Montalva, Chilean elected president in 1964 and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].\n\nThe poet's second major volume of poetry, ''Tala'', appeared in 1938, published in [[Buenos Aires]] with the help of longtime friend and correspondent [[Victoria Ocampo]]. The proceeds for the sale were devoted to children orphaned by the [[Spanish Civil War]]. This volume includes many poems celebrating the customs and folklore of Latin America as well as Mediterranean Europe. Mistral uniquely fuses these locales and concerns, a reflection of her identification as \"una mestiza de vasco,\" her [[Europe]]an [[Basque people|Basque]]-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Amerindian]] background.\n\nOn August 14, 1943, Mistral's 17-year-old nephew, Juan Miguel Godoy, killed himself. Mistral considered Juan Miguel as a son. The grief of this death, as well as her responses to tensions of World War II and then the [[Cold War]] in Europe and the Americas, are all reflected in the last volume of poetry published in her lifetime, ''Lagar'', which appeared in a truncated form in 1954. A final volume of poetry, ''[[Poema de Chile]]'', was edited posthumously by her friend Doris Dana and published in 1967. ''Poema de Chile'' describes the poet's return to Chile after death, in the company of an Indian boy from the [[Atacama]] desert and an [[Andes|Andean]] deer, the [[Hippocamelus|huemul]]. This collection of poetry anticipates the interests in objective description and re-vision of the epic tradition just then becoming evident among poets of the Americas, all of whom Mistral read carefully.\n[[File:MistralEarlyChildhoodCenter.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Gabriela Mistral Early Childhood Center in [[Houston]]<ref name=\"SchoolHistoriesHoustonISD\">\"[http://www.houstonisd.org/HISDConnectDS/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=0afe09c28afc3110VgnVCM10000028147fa6RCRD&vgnextchannel=2e2b2f796138c010VgnVCM10000052147fa6RCRD School Histories: the Stories Behind the Names].\" [[Houston Independent School District]]. Retrieved on September 24, 2008.</ref>]]\n\nOn November 15, 1945, Mistral became the first Latin American, and fifth woman, to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. She received the award in person from [[Gustav V of Sweden|King Gustav of Sweden]] on December 10, 1945. In 1947 she received a doctor honoris causa from [[Mills College]], [[Oakland, California]]. In 1951 she was awarded the [[Chilean National Prize for Literature|National Literature Prize]] in Chile.\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Gabiela Mistral con Santiago Martinez Delgado.jpg|thumb|right|Gabriela Mistral with Master [[Santiago Mart\u00ednez Delgado]] at [[Columbia University]] in NY, probably October 1930.]] -->\n\nPoor health somewhat slowed Mistral's traveling. During the last years of her life she made her home in the town of Roslyn, New York; in early January 1957 she transferred to Hempstead, New York, where she died from [[pancreatic cancer]] on January 10, 1957, aged 67. Her remains were returned to Chile nine days later. The Chilean government declared three days of national mourning, and hundreds of thousands of Chileans came to pay her their respects.\n\nSome of Mistral's best known poems include ''Piececitos de Ni\u00f1o'', ''Balada'', ''Todas \u00cdbamos a ser Reinas'', ''La Oraci\u00f3n de la Maestra'', ''El \u00c1ngel Guardi\u00e1n'', ''Dec\u00e1logo del Artista'' and ''La Flor del Aire''. She wrote and published some 800 essays in magazines and newspapers; she was also a well-known correspondent and highly regarded orator both in person and over the radio.\n\nMistral may be most widely quoted in English for ''Su Nombre es Hoy'' (His Name is Today):\n:''\u201cWe are guilty of many errors and many faults, but our worst crime is abandoning the children, neglecting the fountain of life. Many of the things we need can wait. The child cannot. Right now is the time his bones are being formed, his blood is being made, and his senses are being developed. To him we cannot answer \u2018Tomorrow,\u2019 his name is today.\u201d''\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*1914: [[Juegos Florales]], ''[[Sonetos de la Muerte]]''\n*1945: [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] \n*1951: [[Chilean National Prize for Literature]]\n\nThe Venezualan writer and diplomat who worked under the name [[Lucila Palacios]] took her nom de plume in honour of Mistral's original name.<ref name=name>Tomado de los Libros: \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 Celebramos Hoy?\" de Vinicio Romero Mart\u00ednez y Segunda edici\u00f3n \"Dicionario de Historia de Venezuela\".

In 1984 she was appointed to an [[Albert Schweitzer]] chair at the [[University at Albany, The State University of New York]]. From 1989 until her retirement in 2006, Morrison held the [[Robert F. Goheen]] Chair in the Humanities at [[Princeton University]].<ref name=\"nola\"/>\n\nThough based in the Creative Writing Program at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Morrison did not regularly offer writing workshops to students after the late 1990s, a fact that earned her some criticism. Rather, she has conceived and developed the prestigious ''Princeton Atelier'', a program that brings together talented students with critically acclaimed, world-famous artists. Together the students and the artists produce works of art that are presented to the public after a semester of collaboration. In her position at Princeton, Morrison used her insights to encourage not merely new and emerging writers, but artists working to develop new forms of art through interdisciplinary play and cooperation.\n\nAt its 1979 commencement ceremonies, [[Barnard College]] awarded her its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction.

She and her then-husband, [[Edvard Moser]], pioneered research on the brain's mechanism for representing space together with their mentor [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]]. They shared the 2014 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with O'Keefe,<ref>[http://www.academia-net.org/profil/prof-phd-may-britt-moser/1187296 May-Britt Moser profile], Academia-Net.org; accessed 7 October 2014.</ref> awarded for work concerning the [[grid cells]] in the entorhinal cortex, as well as several additional space-representing cell types in the same circuit that make up the positioning system in the brain.  Moser discovered types of cells that are important for determining position (spatial representation) close to the hippocampus, an area located in the center of the brain.  Moser investigated correlations between the anatomical structure of the hippocampus and social learning in rats. Moser's work gave the ability for scientists to gain new knowledge into the cognitive processes and spacial deficits associated with human neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe Mosers were educated at the [[University of Oslo]] and were appointed associate professors in psychology and neuroscience at NTNU in 1996. They were instrumental in the establishment of the Centre for the Biology of Memory (CBM) in 2002 and the [[Institute for Systems Neuroscience]] at NTNU in 2007. The Mosers were 1 in 5 other couples to win a Nobel Prize.\n\n==Personal life==\nMay-Britt was born in Fosnav\u00e5g, M\u00f8re and Romsdal, Norway in 1963. She and her husband attended the same high school, but didn't know each other that well before they ended up at the same university. Moser's favorite subjects in high school were mathematics and physics. They agreed that they should study psychology together and work together and their relationship went from there. They married in 1985<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/science/may-britt-and-edvard-moser-explore-the-brains-gps.html?_r=0</ref> and have two daughters together. They announced that they are divorcing in 2016.<ref>http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/nobelpris-paret-moser-skilles/a/23602875/</ref>\n\n==Career==\nMay-Britt Moser was awarded a degree in psychology from the [[University of Oslo]] in 1990. She thereafter was awarded her [[Ph.D.]] in Neurophysiology from the University of Oslo in 1995,<ref>Moser, M-B. (1995). ''Structural correlates of spatial learning in the hippocampus of adult rats''. Thesis for the degree of Ph.D, University of Oslo (Defended, 9 December 1995)</ref> under the supervision of professor [[Per Andersen]]. Moser went on to undertake postdoctoral training with [[Richard G.

From odd observations the villagers sometimes make (\u201cMan is nothing but a pheasant in the world\u201d), to chapters titled after unimportant props (\u201cThe Pot Hole\u201d, \u201cThe Needle\u201d), everything points to a strategy of displaced meaning \u2026 Every such incidence of misdirection is the whole book in miniature, for although Ceausescu is never mentioned, he is central to the story, and cannot be forgotten.

In Romanian, 'snowdrops' are 'little tears', in German they are 'Schneegl\u00f6ckchen', that is 'little snow bells', which means we\u2019re not only speaking about different words, but about different worlds.''\" (However here she confuses snowdrops with [[lily-of-the-valley]], the latter being called 'little tears' in Romanian.) She continues, \"''Romanians see a falling star and say that someone has died, with the Germans you make a wish when you see the falling star.''\"  Romanian folk music is another influence: \"''When I first heard [[Maria T\u0103nase]] she sounded incredible to me, it was for the first time that I really felt what folklore meant. Romanian folk music is connected to existence in a very meaningful way.''\"<ref>[http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&sec=13&art=4641 \"An Evening with Herta M\u00fcller\"], Radio Romania International, 17 August 2007.

Both grew up in Romania as members of the Banat Swabian ethnic group and enrolled in German and Romanian literary studies at [[West University of Timi\u0219oara|Timi\u0219oara University]]. Upon graduating, both worked as German-language teachers, and were members of Aktionsgruppe Banat, a literary society that fought for freedom of speech.\n\nM\u00fcller's involvement with Aktionsgruppe Banat gave her the courage to write boldly, despite the threats and trouble generated by the Romanian secret police. Although her books are fictional, they are based on real people and experiences. Her 1996 novel, ''[[The Land of Green Plums]]'' was written after the deaths of two friends, in which M\u00fcller suspected the involvement of the secret police, and one of its characters was based on a close friend from Aktionsgruppe Banat.<ref>[http://www.infloox.com/influence?id=6b8a8351 \"Herta M\u00fcller and the Aktionsgruppe Banat\".]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n=== Prose ===\n[[File:Herta M\u00fcller.jpg|thumb|upright|M\u00fcller signing one of her books in September 2009]]\n* ''Niederungen'', (short stories), censored version published in [[Bucharest]], 1982.

Her collections have been translated into thirteen languages.<ref name=HappyShadesVintage1998/> On 10 October 2013, Munro was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], cited as a \"master of the contemporary short story\".<ref name=\"nobelprize.org\"/><ref name=\"NYT-20131010\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24477246 |title=Alice Munro wins Nobel Prize for Literature |publisher=BBC News |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref> She is the first Canadian and the 13th woman<!-- do not insert woman--> to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature.<ref>[[Saul Bellow]], the 1976 laureate, was born in Canada, but he moved to the United States at age nine and became a US citizen at twenty-six.</ref>\n\nMunro is noted for her longtime association with editor and publisher [[Douglas Gibson]].<ref name=panofsky>{{cite book|last=Panofsky|first=Ruth|title=The Literary Legacy of the Macmillan Company of Canada: Making Books and Mapping Culture|year=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780802098771}}</ref> When Gibson left [[Macmillan of Canada]] in 1986 to launch his own [[Douglas Gibson Books]] imprint at [[McClelland and Stewart]], Munro returned the advance that Macmillan had already paid her for ''[[The Progress of Love]]'' so that she could follow Gibson to the new company.<ref>\"Munro follows publisher Gibson from Macmillan\". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 30 April 1986.</ref> Munro and Gibson have retained their professional association ever since; when Gibson published his own memoirs in 2011, Munro wrote the introduction, and to this day Gibson often makes public appearances on Munro's behalf when her health prevents her from appearing personally.<ref>[http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/alice-munro-unlikely-to-come-out-of-retirement-following-nobel-win-1.1494171 \"Alice Munro unlikely to come out of retirement following Nobel win\"].

However, in most cases these are the first versions only.<ref>[[List of short stories by Alice Munro#Short Stories by title .28sortable.29|Which of the stories have free Web versions]].</ref> From the period before 2003, 16&nbsp;stories have been included in Munro's own compilations more than twice, with two of her works scoring even four republications: \"Carried Away\" and \"Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage\".<ref>For further details, see [[List of short stories by Alice Munro]].</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nMany of Munro's stories are set in [[Huron County, Ontario]]. Her strong regional focus is one of the features of her fiction. Another is the omniscient narrator who serves to make sense of the world. Many compare Munro's small-town settings to writers from the [[Southern United States|rural South]] of the United States. As in the works of [[William Faulkner]] and [[Flannery O'Connor]], her characters often confront deep-rooted customs and traditions, but the reaction of Munro's characters is generally less intense than their Southern counterparts'. Her male characters tend to capture the essence of the [[everyman]], while her female characters are more complex. Much of Munro's work exemplifies the literary genre known as [[Southern Ontario Gothic]].<ref>Susanne Becker, ''Gothic Forms of Feminine Fictions''. [[Manchester University Press]], 1999.</ref>\n\nMunro's work is often compared with the great short-story writers. In her stories, as in Chekhov's, plot is secondary and \"little happens.\" As with Chekhov, Garan Holcombe notes: \"All is based on the [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic moment]], the sudden enlightenment, the concise, subtle, revelatory detail.\" Munro's work deals with \"love and work, and the failings of both. She shares Chekhov's obsession with time and our much-lamented inability to delay or prevent its relentless movement forward.\"<ref name=\"Holcombe\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Holcombe | first = Garan | title = Alice Munro | encyclopedia = Contemporary Writers | volume = | pages = | publisher = British Arts Council | location = London | year = 2005 | url = http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth03D29L044112635689 | accessdate = 20 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nA frequent theme of her work, particularly evident in her early stories, has been the dilemmas of a girl coming of age and coming to terms with her family and the small town she grew up in. In recent work such as ''Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage'' (2001) and ''[[Runaway (book)|Runaway]]'' (2004) she has shifted her focus to the travails of middle age, of women alone, and of the elderly. It is a mark of her style for characters to experience a revelation that sheds light on, and gives meaning to, an event.\n\nMunro's prose reveals the ambiguities of life: \"ironic and serious at the same time,\" \"mottoes of godliness and honor and flaming bigotry,\" \"special, useless knowledge,\" \"tones of shrill and happy outrage,\" \"the bad taste, the heartlessness, the joy of it.\" Her style places the fantastic next to the ordinary, with each undercutting the other in ways that simply and effortlessly evoke life.<ref>\n{{cite journal | last = Hoy | first = Helen | title = Dull, Simple, Amazing and Unfathomable: Paradox and Double Vision In Alice Munro's Fiction | journal = Studies in Canadian Literature | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 1980 | publisher = University of New Brunswick | url = http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/SCL/bin/get.cgi?directory=vol5_1/&filename=hoy.htm | accessdate = 20 June 2007 }}</ref> As Robert Thacker wrote:\n\n{{bquote|Munro's writing creates... an empathetic union among readers, critics most apparent among them.

Her works \"Save the Reaper\" and \"Passion\" came out in two different versions in the same year, in 1998 and 2004 respectively. At the other end of the scale, two stories were republished in a variant version about 30 years later, \"Home\" (1974/2006) and \"Wood\" (1980/2009).<ref>For details please see [[List of short stories by Alice Munro#Short Stories by title .28sortable.29|List of short stories by Alice Munro]]</ref>\n\nAnn Close and Lisa Dickler Awano reported in 2006 that Munro had not wanted to reread the galleys of ''Runaway'' (2004): \"No, because I\u2019ll rewrite the stories.\" In their symposium contribution ''An Appreciation of Alice Munro'' they say that of her story \"Powers\", for example, Munro did eight versions in all.<ref>[http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/summer/close-munro/ An Appreciation of Alice Munro], by Ann Close and Lisa Dickler Awano, Compiler and Editor.

In this case, Awano says, Munro revised characterizations, themes and perspectives, as well as rhythmic syllables, a conjunction or a punctuation mark. The characters change, too. Inferring from the perspective they take on things, they are middle-age in 1980, and in 2009 they are older. Awano perceives a heightened lyricism brought about not least by the poetic precision of the revision undertaken by the author.<ref name =\"Awano 2012\" /> The 2009 version is made up of eight sections instead of three in 1980, and it has a new ending. Awano writes that Munro literally \"refinishes\" the first take on the story, with an ambiguity that is characteristic of Munro\u2019s endings, and that the author re-imagines her stories throughout her work a variety of ways.<ref name =\"Awano 2012\" />\n\nSeveral stories were re-published with considerable variation as to which content goes into which section. This can be seen, for example, in \"Home\", \"The Progress of Love\", \"What Do You Want to Know For?\", \"The Children Stay\", \"Save the Reaper\", \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\", \"Passion\", \"The View Fom Castle Rock\", \"Wenlock Edge\", and \"Deep-Holes\".\n\n==Personal life==\nMunro married James Munro in 1951. Their daughters Sheila, Catherine, and Jenny were born in 1953, 1955, and 1957 respectively; Catherine died 15 hours after birth.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nIn 1963, the Munros moved to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] where they opened [[Munro's Books]], a popular bookstore still in business. In 1966, their daughter Andrea was born. Alice and James Munro divorced in 1972.\n\nMunro returned to Ontario to become writer in residence at the [[University of Western Ontario]], and in 1976 received an honorary [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] from the institution.

She received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1982. She married [[Gunnar Myrdal]] in 1924.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Uppsala]], she first came to public notice in the 1930s, and was one of the main driving forces in the creation of the Swedish [[welfare state]]. She coauthored the book ''[[Crisis in the Population Question]]'' ({{lang-sv|Kris i befolkningsfr\u00e5gan}} with Gunnar Myrdal in 1934). The basic premise of ''Crisis in the Population Question'' is to find what social reforms are needed to allow for individual liberty (especially for women) while also promoting child-bearing, and encouraging Swedes to have children.  With architect [[Sven Markelius]] she designed Stockholm's cooperative ''Collective House'' in 1937 with an eye towards developing more domestic liberty for women.\n\nA long-time prominent member of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], in the late 1940s she became involved in international issues with the [[United Nations]], appointed to head its section on welfare policy in 1949. From 1950 to 1955 she was chairman of [[UNESCO]]'s social science section\u2014the first woman to hold such prominent positions in the UN. In 1955-1956 she served as a Swedish envoy to [[New Delhi]], India, [[Rangoon]], Burma (Myanmar) and [[Colombo]], Ceylon (Sri Lanka).<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Biografie Alva Myrdal\n| work = 50 Klassiker der Soziologie, Universitat Graz\n| accessdate = 2013-11-22\n| url = http://agso.uni-graz.at/lexikon/klassiker/myrdal/36bio.htm\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1962 Myrdal was elected to the Swedish parliament, and in 1962 she was sent as the Swedish delegate to the UN [[disarmament]] conference in Geneva, a role she kept until 1973. She participated in the creation of the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], becoming the first Chairman of the governing board in 1966. In 1966 she was also named consultative Cabinet minister for disarmament, an office she held until 1973. A vocal supporter of disarmament, Myrdal received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1982 together with [[Alfonso Garcia Robles]]. In 1983 Myrdal effectively ended the heated controversy over the future of [[Adolf Fredrik's Music School]], \"The AF-fight\" (Swedish: AF-striden).<ref>{{cite thesis |type=B.A. |url=http://epubl.ltu.se/1402-1773/2006/194/LTU-CUPP-06194-SE.pdf |first=Elisabeth |last=Lutteman |title=Musikklass - ett pedagogiskt sp\u00e4nningsf\u00e4lt |publisher=Lule\u00e5 Tekniska Universitet |pages=7-8 |year=2006 ||issn=1402-1773 |accessdate=2014-12-14  |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nShe is the mother of [[Jan Myrdal]], [[Sissela Bok]] and [[Kaj F\u00f6lster]].\n\nShe died the day after her 84th birthday.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of female Nobel laureates]]\n*[[Social engineering (political science)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book\n| publisher = Indiana University Press\n| isbn = 9780253351326\n| last = Hirdman\n| first = Yvonne\n| title = Alva Myrdal: the passionate mind\n| location = Bloomington\n| date = 2008\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Myrdal, Alva & Klein, Viola, ''Women\u2019s Two Roles: Home and Work''.

At this point (the late 1970s and early 1980s) little was known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which multicellular organisms [[developmental biology|develop]] from single cells to morphologically complex forms during [[embryogenesis]].\n\nFruit flies have long been an important [[model organism]] in [[genetics]] due to their small size and quick generation time, which makes even large numbers of them relatively easy to maintain and observe in the laboratory.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arias AM |title=Drosophila melanogaster and the development of biology in the 20th century |journal=Methods Mol. Biol. |volume=420 |issue= |pages=1\u201325 |year=2008 |pmid=18641938 |doi=10.1007/978-1-59745-583-1_1 |url= |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |isbn=978-1-58829-817-1}}</ref> N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus identified genes involved in embryonic development by a series of  [[genetic screen]]s.  They generated random [[mutations]] in fruit flies using EMS ([[ethyl methanesulfonate]]). Some of these mutations affected genes involved in the development of the embryo. N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Weischaus took advantage of the [[Segmentation (biology)|segmented]] form of ''Drosophila'' larvae to address the logic of the genes controlling development. In normal unmutated ''Drosophila,'' each segment produces bristles called denticles in a band arranged on the side of the segment closer to the head (the [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Anterior_and_posterior|anterior]]). The researchers looked at the pattern of segments and denticles in each mutant under the microscope, and were therefore able to work out that particular genes were involved in different processes during development based on their differing mutant phenotypes (such as fewer segments, gaps in the normal segment pattern, and alterations in the patterns of denticles on the segments).<ref>{{cite journal |author=N\u00fcsslein-Volhard C, Wieschaus E |title=Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in Drosophila |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5785 |pages=795\u2013801 |date=October 1980 |pmid=6776413 |doi= 10.1038/287795a0|url=}}</ref> Many of these genes were given descriptive names based on the appearance of the mutant larvae, such as [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|''hedgehog'']], ''[[gurken]]'' (German: \"cucumbers\"), and ''[[Kr\u00fcppel]]'' ( \"cripple\"). Later, researchers identified exactly which gene had been affected by each mutation, thereby identifying a [[Drosophila embryogenesis|set of genes crucial for ''Drosophila'' embryogenesis]]. The subsequent study of these mutants and their interactions led to important new insights into early ''Drosophila'' development, especially the mechanisms that underlie the step-wise development of body segments. \n\nThese experiments are not only distinguished by their sheer scale (with the methods available at the time, they involved an enormous workload), but more importantly by their significance for organisms other than fruit flies. It was later found that many of the genes identified here had [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] in other species. In particular, the [[homeobox]] genes (coding for [[transcription factors]] critically involved in early body development) are found in all [[metazoan]]s, and usually have similar roles in body [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]].\n\nThese findings have also  led to important realizations about evolution - for example, that [[protostomes]] and [[deuterostomes]] are likely to have had a relatively well-developed common ancestor with a much more complex body plan than had been conventionally thought.\n\nAdditionally, they greatly increased our understanding of the regulation of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], as well as cell fate during development.\n\nN\u00fcsslein-Volhard is associated with the discovery of ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'', which led to the identification of [[toll-like receptor]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/6/1085 |title=Toll To Be Paid at the Gateway to the Vessel Wall -- Hansson and Edfeldt 25 (6): 1085 -- Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology |accessdate=2007-11-10 |format= |work=}}</ref>\n\n===Later work===\nSince 1985 Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard has been Director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology]] in [[T\u00fcbingen]] and also leads its Genetics Department.

Since 2001 she has been member of the ''Nationaler Ethikrat'' (National Ethics Council of Germany) for the [[Ethics|ethical]] assessment of new developments in the [[life sciences]] and their influence on the individual and society. Her primer for the lay-reader, ''Coming to Life: How Genes Drive Development'', was published in April 2006.\n\nIn 2004 N\u00fcsslein-Volhard started the Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard Foundation (''Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard Stiftung'').

Her best-known play is ''Eli: Ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels'' (1950); other works include the poems \"Zeichen im Sand\" (1962), \"Verzauberung\" (1970), and the collections of poetry ''In den Wohnungen des Todes'' (1947), ''Flucht und Verwandlung'' (1959), ''Fahrt ins Staublose'' (1961), and ''Suche nach Lebenden'' (1971).\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn Leonie Sachs in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], Germany in 1891, to the wealthy [[natural rubber]] and [[gutta-percha]] manufacturer Georg William Sachs (1858-1930) and his wife Margarete, n\u00e9e Karger (1871-1950),<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1966/sachs-autobio.html \"Nelly Sachs \u2013 Autobiography\". Nobelprize.org.]</ref> she was educated at home because of frail health. She showed early signs of talent as a [[dance]]r, but her protective parents did not encourage her to pursue a profession. She grew up as a very sheltered, introverted young woman and never married. She pursued an extensive correspondence with, and was friends with, [[Selma Lagerl\u00f6f]] and [[Hilde Domin]]. As the Nazis took power, she became increasingly terrified, at one point losing the ability to speak, as she would remember in verse: \"When the great terror came/I fell dumb.\" Sachs fled with her aged mother to Sweden in 1940. It was her friendship with Lagerl\u00f6f that saved their lives: shortly before her own death Lagerl\u00f6f intervened with the Swedish royal family to secure their release from Germany. Sachs and her mother escaped on the last flight from Nazi Germany to Sweden, a week before Sachs was scheduled to report to a [[concentration camp]]. They settled in Sweden and Sachs became a Swedish citizen in 1952.\n\nLiving in a tiny two-room apartment in Stockholm, Sachs cared alone for her mother for many years, and supported their existence by translations between Swedish and German. After her mother's death, Sachs suffered several nervous breakdowns characterized by [[hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], and [[delusion]]s of persecution by Nazis, and she spent a number of years in a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]]. She continued to write even while hospitalized. She eventually recovered sufficiently to live on her own, though her mental health would always be fragile. Her worst breakdown was ostensibly precipitated by hearing German speech during a trip to Switzerland to accept a literary prize. However, she maintained a forgiving attitude toward a younger generation of Germans, and corresponded with many German-speaking writers of the postwar period, including [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]].\n\n== Paul Celan and lyrical poetry==\n\nIn the context of the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]], her deep friendship with \"brother\" poet [[Paul Celan]] is often noted today. Their bond was described in one of Celan's most famous poems, \"Z\u00fcrich, Zum Storchen\" (\"Z\u00fcrich, The Stork Inn\").<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/c/celan-selected.html Excerpt ''Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan''], translated by John Felstiner. [[W. W. Norton & Company|W. W. Norton]]. In ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> Sachs and Celan shared Holocaust and the fate of the Jews throughout history, their interest in Jewish and Christian mysticism, and their literary models; their imagery was often remarkably similar though developed independently. Their friendship was supportive during professional conflicts. Celan also suffered from artistic infighting ([[Claire Goll]]'s accusations of [[plagiarism]]) during a period of frustration with the reception of his work. When Sachs met Celan she was embroiled in a long dispute with Finnish-Jewish composer [[Moses Pergament]] over his musical adaptation of her stage play ''Eli: Ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels''. In Celan, she found someone who understood her own anxiety and hardships as an artist.\n\nSachs' poetry is intensely [[lyric poetry|lyrical]] and reflects some influence by [[German Romanticism]], especially in her early work. The poetry she wrote as a young woman in Berlin is more inspired by Christianity than Judaism and makes use of traditional Romantic imagery and themes. Much of it concerns an unhappy love affair Sachs suffered in her teens, with a non-Jewish man who would eventually be killed in a concentration camp. After Sachs learned of her only love interest's death, she bound up his fate with that of her people and wrote many love lyrics ending not only in the beloved's death, but in the catastrophe of the Holocaust. Sachs herself mourns no longer as a jilted lover but as a personification of the Jewish people in their vexed relationship to history and God. Sachs' fusion of grief with subtly romantic elements is in keeping with the imagery of the [[kabbalah]], where the [[Shekhinah]] represents God's presence on earth and mourns for the separation of God from His people in their suffering. Thus Sachs' Romanticism allowed her to develop [[self-consciousness|self-consciously]] from a German to a Jewish writer, with a corresponding change in her language: still flowery and conventional in some of her first poetry on the Holocaust, it becomes ever more compressed and surreal, returning to a series of the same images and tropes (dust, stars, breath, stones and jewels, blood, dancers, fish suffering out of water, madness, and the ever-frustrated love) in ways that are sometimes comprehensible only to her readers, but always moving and disturbing. Though Sachs does not resemble many authors, she appears to have been influenced by [[Gertrud Kolmar]] and [[Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler]] in addition to Paul Celan.\n\nIn 1961 she became the inaugural winner of the [[Nelly Sachs Prize]], a [[Literary award|literary prize]] awarded biennially by the German city of Dortmund, and named in her honour. When, with [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]], she was awarded the 1966 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], she observed that Agnon represented Israel whereas \"I represent the tragedy of the Jewish people.\"\n\nFollowing her death from [[intestinal cancer]] in 1970, Nelly Sachs was interred in the [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in Stockholm. Her possessions were donated to the [[National Library of Sweden]].<ref>[http://www.kb.se/aktuellt/evenemang/Nelly-Sachs-i-KBs-samlingar/ Nelly Sachs' collection at the National Library of Sweden]</ref>\n\nA [[:File:Gedenktafel Maa\u00dfenstr 12 (Sch\u00f6) Nelly Sachs.jpg|memorial plaque]] commemorates her birthplace, Maa\u00dfenstra\u00dfe 12, in [[Sch\u00f6neberg]], Berlin; where there is also a park, in Dennewitzstra\u00dfe, named after her.

She was additionally disadvantaged because her father, as a third son, had no great estates or other financial resources to be inherited. Suttner was baptised at the [[Church of Our Lady of the Snows (Prague)|Church of Our Lady of the Snows]], not a traditional choice for the aristocracy.<ref name=\"Hamann, p. 2\"/>\n\nSoon after her birth, Suttner's mother moved to live in [[Brno]] with her guardian [[Landgrave]] Friedrich zu F\u00fcrstenberg. Her older brother Arthur was sent to a military school, at the age of six, and subsequently had little contact with the family. In 1855 Suttner's aunt Loffe and cousin Elvira joined the household.<ref>Playne, p. 16</ref> Elvira, whose father was a private tutor, was of a similar age to Suttner and intellectually precocious, introducing Suttner to the pleasures of literature and philosophy.<ref>Hamann p. 5</ref> Beyond her reading, Suttner gained proficiency in French, Italian and English as an adolescent, under the supervision of a succession of private tutors; she also became an accomplished amateur pianist and singer.<ref name=\"Hamann pp. 9-10\">Hamann pp. 9-10</ref>\n\nSuttner's mother and aunt suffered from delusions of clairvoyance and thus elected to gamble at [[Wiesbaden]] in the summer of 1856, hoping to return with a fortune. Their losses were so heavy that they were forced to move to [[Vienna]]. During this trip Suttner received a proprosal from Prince Philipp zu [[Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] which was declined due to her tender age.<ref>Hamann pp. 5-6</ref> The family returned to Wiesbaden in 1859; the second trip was similarly unfortunate, and they had to relocate to a small property in [[Klosterneuburg]]. Shortly after this turn of events, Suttner wrote her first published work, the novella ''Endertra\u00fcme im Monde'', which appeared in ''Die Deutsche Frau''. Continuing poor financial circumstance led Suttner to a brief engagement to the wealthy [[Gustav Heine von Geldern]], whom she came to find unattractive and rejected; her memoirs record her disgusted response to the older man's attempt to kiss her.<ref name=\"Hamann pp. 9-10\"/>\n\nIn 1864, the family summered at [[Bad Homburg]] which was also a fashionable gambling destination among the aristocracy of the era. Suttner befriended the Georgian aristocrat [[Ekaterine Dadiani, Princess of Mingrelia]], and met [[Tsar Alexander II]].<ref>Hamann p. 11</ref> Seeking a career as an opera singer as an alternative to marrying money, Suttner undertook an intensive course of lessons, working on her voice for over four hours a day. Despite tuition from the eminent [[Gilbert Duprez]] in Paris in 1867, and from [[Pauline Viardot]] in Baden-Baden in 1868, she never secured a professional engagement. She suffered from [[stage fright]] and was unable to project well in performance.<ref>Playne, p. 29</ref><ref>Kemf, p. 9</ref><ref>Hamann p. 13</ref> In the summer of 1872 she was engaged to Prince Adolf zu [[Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein]] who died at sea while travelling to America to escape his debts in October.<ref>Hamann p. 15</ref>\n\n== Tutor in the Suttner household, life in Georgia ==\n[[File:2013.07.28 Berta v. Suttner Schloss Harmannsdorf.jpg|Schloss Harmannsdorf today.|thumb]] \nBoth Elvira and her guardian Friederich had died in 1866, and Suttner, now above typical marriageable age, felt increasingly constrained by her mother's eccentricity and the family's poor financial circumstances.<ref>Playne, p. 28</ref> In 1873, she found employment as a tutor and companion to the four daughters of Karl von Suttner, aged between fifteen and twenty. The Suttner family lived in the [[Innere Stadt]] of Vienna three seasons of the year, and summered at [[Schloss Harmannsdorf]] in [[Lower Austria]]. Suttner had an affectionate relationship with her four young students, who nicknamed her \"Boulotte\" due to her corpulence, a name she would later adopt as a literary pseudonym in the form \"B. Oulot\".<ref>Hamann pp. 18-19</ref><ref name=\"Playne, p. 45\">Playne, p. 45</ref> She soon fell in love with her charge's elder brother, Arthur Gundaccar, who was seven years her junior. They were engaged but unable to marry due to the Suttners' disapproval. In 1876, with her employers' encouragement, Suttner answered a newspaper advertisement which led to her briefly becoming secretary and housekeeper to [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[Paris]].<ref>Hamann, p. 24</ref> In the few weeks of her employment Suttner and Nobel developed a friendship, and Nobel may have made romantic overtures.<ref>Hamann, p. 26</ref> However, Suttner remained committed to Arthur and returned shortly to Vienna to marry him in secrecy, in the church of St. Aegyd in [[Gumpendorf]].<ref>Hamann, p. 27</ref>\n\nThe newly-weds eloped to [[Principality of Mingrelia|Mingrelia]], where Suttner hoped to make use of her connection to the ruling [[House of Dadiani]]. On their arrival in the country they were entertained by [[Niko I Dadiani|Prince Niko]]. The couple settled in [[Kutaisi]], where they were able to find work teaching languages and music to the children of the local aristocracy. However they experienced considerable hardship despite their social connections, living in a simple three-roomed wooden house.<ref name=\"Playne, p. 45\"/><ref>Hamann pp. 30-31</ref> Their situation worsened in 1877 on the outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War]], although Arthur had some success in reporting on the hostilities for the ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.<ref>Hamann, pp. 32-33</ref> Suttner also wrote frequently for the Austrian press in this period, and worked on her early novels, including in ''Es L\u00f6wos'' a romanticized account of her life with Arthur. In the aftermath of the war, Arthur attempted to set up a timber business, but it was unsuccessful.<ref>Hamann, pp. 34-37</ref>\n\nArthur and Suttner were largely socially isolated in Georgia; their poverty rather than their social status restricted their engagement with high society, and neither ever became fluent speakers of [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] or [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. While Arthur's writing during this period is dominated by local themes, Suttner's was not similarly influenced by Georgian culture.<ref>Hamann, p. 37</ref> Suttner's rejection of the exclusive truth of [[Roman Catholicism]] in favour of a more liberal perspective on Christianity is thought to have stemmed from the [[religious pluralism]] she experienced in Georgia.<ref>Hamann, p. 38</ref>\n\nIn August 1882 Ekaterine Dadiani died. Soon afterwards, the couple decided to relocate to [[Tblisi]]. Here Arthur gained whatever work he could, in accounting, construction and wallpaper design, while Suttner largely concentrated on her writing. She became a correspondent of [[Michael Georg Conrad]], eventually contributing an article to the 1885 edition of his publication ''Die Gesellschaft''. The piece, entitled \"Truth and Lies\", is a polemic in favour of the naturalism of [[\u00c9mile Zola]].<ref>Kempf, pp. 15-16</ref><ref>Hamann, pp. 40-41</ref> Her first significant political work, ''Inventarium einere Seele'' (\"Inventory of the Soul\") was published in [[Leipzig]] in 1883. In it Suttner takes a pro-disarmament, progressive stance, arguing for the inevitability of world peace due to technological advancement; a possibility also considered by her friend Nobel due to the increasingly deterrent effect of more powerful weapons.\n\nIn 1884 Suttner's mother died, saddling the couple with further debts.<ref name=\"Hamann, pp. 42-43\">Hamann, pp. 42-43</ref> Arthur had befriended a Georgian journalist in Tblisi, M,<ref>Suttner could not recall the journalist's full name on writing her memoirs, and his identity is enigmatic.</ref> and the couple agreed to collaborate with him on a translation of the Georgian epic ''[[The Knight in the Panther Skin]]''. Suttner was to improve M.'s literal translation of the Georgian to French, and Arthur to translate the French to German.<ref name=\"Hamann, pp. 42-43\"/> This method proved arduous, and they worked for few hours each day due to the distraction of the Mingrelian countryside around M.'s home. Arthur did publish several important articles on the work in the Georgian press, and illustrations were prepared for the putative edition by [[Mih\u00e1ly Zichy]].<ref name=\"Hamann, pp. 42-43\"/> However, M. failed to produce expected payments, and with the eruption of the [[Bulgarian Crisis (1885\u201388)|Bulgarian Crisis]] in 1885 the couple felt increasingly unsafe in Georgian society, which due to the nation's political domination by Russia was increasingly hostile to Austrians. Arthur's parents now accepted his marriage, and the couple were welcome in Austria; the couple returned in May, to live in the country house at Harmannsdorf.<ref>Hamann, p. 45</ref>\n\n[[File:Suttner's house (Tbilissi).jpg|thumb|Suttner's living house in Tbilisi]]\n\n==Impact==\nSuttner and her husband finally reconciled with his family and in 1885 could return to Austria, where the couple lived at [[Burgschleinitz-K\u00fchnring|Harmannsdorf]] Castle in [[Lower Austria]]. She continued her journalistic activity and concentrated on [[peace and conflict studies]] corresponding with the French philosopher [[Ernest Renan]] and influenced by the [[International Arbitration and Peace Association]] founded by [[Hodgson Pratt]] in 1880. \n[[File:Bertha von Suttner.png|thumb|left|Suttner in 1896]]\nIn 1889 Suttner became a leading figure in the peace movement with the publication of her pacifist novel, ''[[Die Waffen nieder!]]'' (\"Lay Down Your Arms!\"), which made her one of the leading figures of the Austrian [[peace movement]]. The book was published in 37 editions and translated into 12 languages. She witnessed the foundation of the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] and called for the establishment of the Austrian ''Gesellschaft der Friedensfreunde'' pacifist organization in a 1891 ''[[Die Presse|Neue Freie Presse]]'' editorial. Suttner became chairwoman and also founded the [[German Peace Society]] the next year. She gained international repute as editor of the international pacifist journal ''Die Waffen nieder!'', named after her book, from 1892 to 1899. In 1897 she presented Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] with a list of signatures urging the establishment of an [[International Court of Justice]] and took part in the organisation of the First [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] in 1899, however, she had to realize that her ambitious expectations were belied.{{what|reason=This word, \"belied\", is not used in its usual construction. What is meant?|date=April 2016}}\n\nUpon her husband's death in 1902, Suttner had to sell Harmannsdorf Castle and moved back to Vienna. In 1904 she addressed the [[International Congress of Women]] in [[Berlin]] and for seven months travelled around the United States attending a universal [[peace congress]] in [[Boston]] and meeting President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].\n\n==Nobel Peace Prize==\nThough her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will, which she received in the fifth term on 10 December 1905. The bestowal took place on 18 April 1906 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]].\n\nIn 1907 Suttner attended the Second Hague Peace Conference, which however mainly negotiated on aspects of [[law of war]]. On the eve of [[World War I]], she continued to advise against international armament. In 1911 she became a member of the advisory council of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Peace Foundation]].<ref>{{EB1922|inline=1|title=Suttner, Bertha|volume=32|page=628|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri32newyrich#page/628/mode/1up}}</ref> On 21 June 1914, a few weeks before war broke out, she succumbed to cancer. She had planned to attend the next Universal Peace Congress, which was scheduled to take place in Vienna in the autumn.\n\nIn the comprehensive socio-cultural debate of her day, Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'')\n<ref name=\"weop\">''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

Thus, she felt a right to peace could be demanded under international law and was necessary in the sense of an evolutionary ([[Darwinism|Darwinist]]) conception of history.

Mother Teresa Day ''(Dita e N\u00ebn\u00eb Terez\u00ebs)'' on 19 October is a [[Public holidays in Albania|public holiday in Albania]].

The [[Cathedral of Blessed Mother Teresa in Pristina|Roman Catholic cathedral]] in [[Pristina]] is also dedicated in her honour. Its construction sparked controversy in Muslim circles in 2011; local Muslim leaders claimed that the cathedral was too large for Pristina's small Catholic community and complained that most Muslim places of worship in the city were far smaller. An initiative to erect a monument to Mother Teresa in the town of [[Pe\u0107]] that same year was also protested by some Albanian Muslims. A youth group calling itself the Muslim Youth Forum started a petition demanding that a monument to Albanian veterans of the [[Kosovo War]] be erected instead, and collected some 2,000 signatures by May 2011. The Muslim Youth Forum claimed that the building of a Mother Teresa monument would represent an insult to the town's Muslim community, which makes up about 98 percent of the population. Noli Zhita, the group's spokesperson, claimed that Mother Teresa was not an Albanian but a Vlach from Macedonia. He described the monument's planned construction as part of a plot to \"Christianise\" Kosovo. The Mayor of Pe\u0107, Ali Berisha, voiced support for the monument's construction and indicated that the head of the Islamic community in the town had not raised any objections.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Balkan Insight|title=Kosovo Muslims Resent New Mother Teresa Statue|author=Petrit Collaku|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-row-over-mother-teresa-statue|date=26 May 2011|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Mother Teresa Women's University]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motherteresawomenuniv.ac.in|title=:: Welcome To Mother Teresa Women\u2019s University ::|publisher=}}</ref> [[Kodaikanal]], Tamil Nadu, has been established in 1984 as a public university by [[government of Tamil Nadu]], India.\n\nMother Theresa Post Graduate and Research Institute of Health Sciences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mtihs.puducherry.gov.in|title=Mother Theresa Post Graduate And Research Institute of Health Sciences, Pondicherry|publisher=Mtihs.Pondicherry.gov.in|accessdate=28 August 2011}}</ref> [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] has been established in 1999 by Government of Puducherry, India.\n\nThe charitable organisation [[Sevalaya]] runs the [[Sevalaya#Mother Teresa Girls Home|Mother Teresa Girls Home]], named in her honour and designed to provide poor and orphan girls children in the vicinity of the underserved Kasuva village in Tamil Nadu with free food, clothing, shelter, and education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Activities: Children home |url=http://www.sevalaya.org/activities/vivekananda.php |publisher=Sevalaya |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20141101114450/http://www.sevalaya.org/activities/vivekananda.php |archivedate=1 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\nVarious tributes have been published in Indian newspapers and magazines written by her biographer, Navin Chawla.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/08/25/stories/2007082554761400.htm|title=The miracle of faith|work=The Hindu|date=25 August 2007|accessdate=24 August 2010|location=Chennai, India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2006/08/26/stories/2006082604071000.htm |title=Memories of Mother Teresa |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=26 August 2006 |accessdate=22 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110523121959/http://www.hinduonnet.com:80/2006/08/26/stories/2006082604071000.htm |archivedate=23 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://india-today.com/itoday/15091997/navin.html|title=Touch the Poor...|publisher=India-today.com|date=15 September 1997|accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/10/04/stories/2003100401101000.htm|title=The path to Sainthood|publisher=Hinduonnet.com|date=4 October 2003|accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/10/04/stories/2003100401101000.htm|title=In the shadow of a saint |publisher=Hinduonnet.com|date=4 October 2003|accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Navin Chawla|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Mission+possible/1/6961.html|title=Mission Possible|publisher=Indiatoday.digitaltoday.in|date=11 April 2008|accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/08/26/stories/2008082655280900.htm|title=Mother Teresa and the joy of giving|work=The Hindu|date=26 August 2008|accessdate=28 August 2011|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n[[Indian Railways]] introduced a new train, \"Mother Express\", named after Mother Teresa, on 26 August 2010 to mark her birth centenary.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Mother Express\" to be launched on Aug 26 |work=IBN Live |date=2 August 2010 |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/mother-express-to-be-launched-on-aug-26/194494.html |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110812053510/http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/mother-express-to-be-launched-on-aug-26/194494.html |archivedate=12 August 2011 }}</ref><!-- CAN ANYONE PROVIDE A MORE RECENT SOURCE?

Because malaria was also a major cause of death in China's southern provinces including [[Hainan]], [[Yunnan]], [[Guangxi]], and [[Guangdong]], Zhou Enlai convinced [[Mao Zedong]] to set up a secret drug discovery project, named [[Project 523]] after its starting date, 23{{nbsp}}May 1967.<ref name=\"McKenna\">[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228382.000-the-modest-woman-who-beat-malaria-for-china.html The modest woman who beat malaria for China], by Phil McKenna, New Scientist, 15 November 2011</ref> Upon joining the project unit, Tu was initially sent to Hainan where she studied patients who had been infected with the disease.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/05/youyou-tu-how-maos-challenge-to-malaria-pioneer-led-to-nobel-prize |title = Tu Youyou: how Mao\u2019s challenge to malaria pioneer led to Nobel prize |author = Tom Phillips |date = 6 October 2015 |publisher = The Guardian}}</ref> During the time she spent there, her husband was [[Down to the Countryside Movement|banished to the countryside]], meaning that her daughter had to be entrusted to a nursery in Beijing.<ref name=\"McKenna\" />\n\nScientists worldwide had screened over 240,000 compounds without success. In 1969, Tu, then 39 years old, had an idea of screening Chinese herbs. She first investigated the Chinese medical classics in history, visiting practitioners of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] all over the country on her own. She gathered her findings in a notebook called ''A Collection of Single Practical Prescriptions for Anti-Malaria''. Her notebook summarized 640 prescriptions. Her team also screened over 2,000 traditional Chinese recipes and made 380 herbal [[extract]]s, which were tested on mice.<ref name=\"McKenna\" />\n\nOne compound was effective, sweet wormwood (''[[Artemisia annua]]''), which was used for \"intermittent fevers,\" a hallmark of malaria. As Tu also presented at the project seminar, its preparation was described in a 1,600-year-old text, in a recipe titled, \"Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One's Sleeve\". At first, it didn't work, because they extracted it with traditional boiling water. Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant; Tu says she was influenced by a [[Chinese herbology|traditional Chinese herbal medicine]] source, ''The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments'', written in 340 by [[Ge Hong]], which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water.<ref name=\"scimag\">{{cite web |url = http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2011/09/lasker-award-rekindles-debate-over-artemisinins-discovery |title = Lasker Award Rekindles Debate Over Artemisinin's Discovery &#124; Science/AAAS &#124; News |publisher = News.sciencemag.org |accessdate = 7 January 2014}}</ref> This book contained the useful reference to the herb: \"A handful of qinghao immersed with two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all.\"<ref name=\"Miller\"/> After rereading the recipe, Tu realised the hot water had already damaged the active ingredient in the plant; therefore she proposed a method using low-temperature ether to extract the effective compound instead.

In 1924, she converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. She fled Norway for the United States in 1940 because of her opposition to [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion]] and [[German occupation of Norway|occupation]] of Norway, but returned after [[World War II]] ended in 1945.\n\nHer best-known work is ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter]]'', a trilogy about life in [[Scandinavia]] in the [[Middle Ages]], portrayed through the experiences of a woman from birth until death. Its three volumes were published between 1920 and 1922.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Sigrid Undset young.jpg|right|thumb|Sigrid Undset as a young girl]]\n\n===Early life===\nSigrid Undset was born on 20 May 1882, in the small town of [[Kalundborg]], [[Denmark]], at the childhood home of her mother, Charlotte Undset (1855\u20131939, n\u00e9e Anna Maria Charlotte Gyth). Sigrid was the eldest of three daughters. She and her family moved to Norway when she was two.\n\nShe grew up in the Norwegian capital, [[Oslo]] (or Kristiania, as it was known until 1925). When she was only 11 years old, her father, the Norwegian archaeologist Ingvald Martin Undset (1853\u20131893), died at the age of 40 after a long illness.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ingvald_Undset/utdypning ''Ingvald Undset'' (Store norske leksikon)]</ref>\n\nThe family's economic situation meant that Undset had to give up hope of a university education and after a one-year secretarial course she obtained work at the age of 16 as a secretary with an engineering company in Kristiania, a post she was to hold for 10 years.\n\nShe joined the [[Norwegian Authors' Union]] in 1907 and in the years 1933\u20131935 headed its Literary Council, eventually serving as the union's chairman from 1936 until 1940.\n\n===Writer===\nWhile employed at office work, Sigrid Undset wrote and studied.  She was 16 years old when she made her first attempt at writing a novel set in the Nordic [[Middle Ages]]. The manuscript, a historical novel set in medieval Denmark, was ready by the time she was 22. It was turned down by the publishing house.\n\nAll the same, two years later she had completed another manuscript; much less voluminous this time, only 80 pages. She had put aside the Middle Ages, and had instead produced a realistic description of a woman with a middle-class background in contemporary Kristiania. This book was also refused by the publishers at first, but it was subsequently accepted. The title was ''Fru Marta Oulie'', and the opening sentence (the words of the book's main character) scandalised the readers: \"I have been unfaithful to my husband\".\n\nThus, at the age of 25, Sigrid Undset made her literary debut with a short [[realism (arts)|realistic]] novel on [[adultery]], set against a contemporary background. It created a stir, and she found herself ranked as a promising young author in Norway. During the years up to 1919, Undset published a number of novels set in contemporary Kristiania. Her contemporary novels of the period 1907\u20131918 are about the city and its inhabitants.  They are stories of working people, of trivial family destinies, of the relationship between parents and children. Her main subjects are women and their love. Or, as she herself put it\u2014in her typically curt and [[irony|ironic]] manner \u2013 \"the [[immoral]] kind\" (of love).\n\nThis realistic period culminated in the novels ''[[Jenny (novel)|Jenny]]'' (1911) and ''[[Vaaren]]'' (Spring) (1914). The first is about a woman painter who, as a result of romantic crises, believes that she is wasting her life, and in the end commits suicide. The other tells of a woman who succeeds in saving both herself and her love from a serious matrimonial crisis, finally creating a secure family. These books placed Undset apart from the incipient [[women's emancipation]] movement in Europe.\n\nUndset's books sold well from the start, and after the publication of her third book, she left her office job and prepared to live on her income as a writer. Having been granted a writer's scholarship, she set out on a lengthy journey in Europe. After short stops in Denmark and Germany, she continued to Italy, arriving in Rome in December 1909, where she remained for nine months. Undset's parents had had a close relationship with Rome, and during her stay there she followed in their footsteps. The encounter with Southern Europe meant a great deal to her; she made friends within the circle of Scandinavian artists and writers in Rome.\n\n===Marriage and children===\nIn Rome, Undset met [[Anders Castus Svarstad]], a Norwegian painter, whom she married almost three years later. She was 30; Svarstad was nine years older, he was married, and he had a wife and three children in Norway. It was nearly three years before Svarstad got his divorce from his first wife.\n\nSigrid and Anders were married in 1912 and went to stay in London for six months. From London, they returned to Rome, where Sigrid's first child was born in January 1913. It was a boy, and he was named after his father. In the years up to 1919, she had another child, and the household also took in Svarstad's three children from his first marriage. These were difficult years: her second child, a girl, was [[mentally handicapped]], as was one of Svarstad's sons.\n\nShe continued writing, finishing her last realistic novels and collections of [[short stories]]. She also entered the public debate on topical themes: [[women's emancipation]] and other [[ethics|ethical]] and [[morality|moral]] issues. She had considerable [[polemical]] gifts, and was critical of emancipation as it was developing, and of the moral and ethical decline she felt was threatening in the wake of the [[First World War]].\n[[File:Sigrid Undset at Bjerkeb\u00e6k.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sigrid Undset at work at Bjerkeb\u00e6k]]\n[[File:Bjerkeb\u00e6k Lillehammer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bjerkeb\u00e6k, Undset's home, now part of [[Maihaugen]] museum]]\nIn 1919, she moved to [[Lillehammer]], a small town in the [[Gudbrand Valley]] in southeast Norway, taking her two children with her. She was then expecting her third child. The intention was that she should take a rest at Lillehammer and move back to Kristiania as soon as Svarstad had their new house in order. However, the marriage broke down and a divorce followed. In August 1919, she gave birth to her third child, at Lillehammer. She decided to make Lillehammer her home, and within two years, Bjerkeb\u00e6k, a large house of traditional Norwegian timber architecture, was completed, along with a large fenced garden with views of the town and the villages around. Here she was able to retreat and concentrate on her writing.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/Bjerkeb%C3%A6k ''Bjerkeb\u00e6k''  (Store norske leksikon)]</ref>\n\n===''Kristin Lavransdatter''===\nAfter the birth of her third child, and with a secure roof over her head, she started on a major project: ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter]].'' She was at home in the subject matter, having written a short novel at an earlier stage about a period in Norwegian history closer to the [[Classical Antiquity|Pre-Christian]] era. She had also published a Norwegian retelling of the [[Arthurian legends]]. She had studied [[Old Norse]] manuscripts and Medieval [[chronicle]]s and visited and examined Medieval churches and [[monasteries]], both at home and abroad. She was now an authority on the period she was portraying and a very different person from the 22-year-old who had written her first novel about the Middle Ages.  What had happened to her in the meantime has to do with more than history and literature, it has just as much to do with her development as a person. She had experienced love and passion. She had been in despair over a sick world in the throes of the bloodbath of the [[First World War]]. When she started on ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter]]'' in 1919, she knew what life was about.\n\n''[[Kristin Lavransdatter]]'' is, of course, a historical novel, but it is more than that. The historical aspects are not even the most important part of it. The historical background is precise, realistic, and never romanticised; this is not a writer's escape from the modern age into vague longings for the past. Instead, in these three volumes Undset transfers the human [[emotions]] of happiness and sorrow, love and despair, into a distant past. Sigrid Undset's choice of the Middle Ages is a result of her admiration for the culture of Medieval [[Christendom]]. She transfers the [[protagonists]] to a distant past in order to establish the distance the author needs. She was aware of being on the threshold of something new in her life as a writer; she searched for, and found the necessary distance by going back to the Middle Ages. \"I am finding my feet, and quite unaided at that,\" she wrote to a friend.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nIt is life's mystery, as she knows it from her own experience, that she writes about in ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter]]''. That is why these 1,400 pages, as well as the 1,200 on ''Olav Audunss\u00f8n'', are timeless. All of her characters, however minor, are every bit as complex and multifaceted as characters in [[Shakespeare]]. In addition, Madame Undset placed them in a time and place which similarly springs to life. It is the city of [[Oslo]] she knew so well, the Gudbrand Valley that she loved, and her father's [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] region.\n\nIt was only after the end of her marriage that Sigrid Undset grew mature enough to write her [[masterpiece]]. In the years between 1920 and 1927 she first published the 3-volume ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter|Kristin]]'', and then the 4-volume ''Olav'' (Audunss\u00f8n), swiftly [[translated]] into English as ''[[The Master of Hestviken]]''. Simultaneously with this creative process, she was engaged in trying to find meaning in her own life, finding the answer in God.\n\nUndset experimented with [[Modernism|modernist]] tropes such as [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] in her novel, although the original English translation by Charles Archer excised many of these passages. In 1997, the first volume of [[Tiina Nunnally]]'s new translation of the work won the [[PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction]] in the category of translation. The names of each volume were translated by Archer as ''The Bridal Wreath'', ''The Mistress of Husaby'', and ''The Cross'', and by Nunnally as ''The Wreath'', ''The Wife'', and ''The Cross''.\n\n===Catholicism===\nBoth Sigrid Undset's parents were [[Atheism|atheists]] and although, in accord with the norm of the day, she and her two younger sisters were baptised and with their mother regularly attended the local [[Lutheran]] church, the milieu in which they were raised was a thoroughly secular one.<ref>Sparrow, Stephen (2003). [http://catholiceducation.org/articles/arts/al0173.html \"Sigrid Undset: Catholic Viking\"]</ref> Undset spent much of her life as an agnostic, but marriage and the outbreak of the First World War were to change her attitudes. During those difficult years she experienced a [[crisis of faith]], almost imperceptible at first, then increasingly strong. The crisis led her from clear agnostic [[Religious skepticism|skepticism]], by way of painful uneasiness about the ethical decline of the age, towards Christianity.\n\nIn all her writing one senses an observant eye for the mystery of life and for that which cannot be explained by [[reason]] or the human [[intellect]]. At the back of her sober, almost brutal realism, there is always an inkling of something unanswerable. At any rate, this crisis radically changed her views and ideology. Whereas she had once believed that man created God, she eventually came to believe that God created man.\n\nHowever, she did not turn to the established Lutheran [[Church of Norway]], where she had been nominally reared. She was received into the [[Catholic Church]] in November 1924, after thorough instruction from the Catholic priest in her local parish. She was 42 years old. She subsequently became a [[Third Order of St. Dominic|lay Dominican]].\n\nIt is noteworthy that the ''[[The Master of Hestviken]]'', written immediately after Undset's conversion, takes place in a historical period when Norway was Catholic, that it has very religious themes of the main character's relations with God and his deep feeling of sin, and that the Medieval Catholic Church is presented in a favorable light, with virtually all clergy and monks in the series being positive characters.\n\nIn Norway Sigrid Undset's conversion to Catholicism was not only considered sensational; it was scandalous. It was also noted abroad, where her name was becoming known through the international success of ''Kristin Lavransdatter''. At the time, there were very few practicing Catholics in Norway, which was an almost exclusively Lutheran country. \"[[Anti-Catholicism]]\" was widespread not only among the Lutheran clergy, but through large sections of the population.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, there was just as much anti-Catholic scorn among the Norwegian [[intelligentsia]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} many of whom were adherents of socialism and communism.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The attacks against her faith and character were quite vicious at times, with the result that Sigrid Undset's literary gifts were aroused in response. For many years she participated in the public debate, going out of her way to defend the Catholic Church. In response, she was swiftly dubbed, \"The Mistress of Bjerkeb\u00e6k,\" and \"The Catholic Lady.\"\n\n===Later life===\nAt the end of this creative eruption, Sigrid Undset entered calmer waters. After 1929, she completed a series of novels set in contemporary [[Oslo]], with a strong Catholic element. She selected her themes from the small Catholic community in Norway. But here also, the main theme is love. She also published a number of weighty historical works which put the history of Norway into a sober perspective. In addition, she translated several [[Icelandic sagas]] into Modern Norwegian and published a number of literary essays, mainly on English literature, of which a long essay on the [[Bront\u00eb]] sisters, and one on [[D. H. Lawrence]], are especially worth mentioning. These are not great literature, but they are strong and inspiring.\n\nIn 1934, she published ''Eleven Years Old'', an autobiographical work. With a minimum of camouflage, it tells the story of her own childhood in Kristiania, of her home, rich in intellectual values and love, and of her sick father. It is one of the most fetching Norwegian books ever written about a little girl.\n\nAt the end of the 1930s she commenced work on a new historical novel set in 18th century Scandinavia. Only the first volume, ''Madame Dorthea'', was published, in 1939. The [[Second World War]] broke out that same year and proceeded to break her, both as a writer and as a woman. She never completed her new novel.

She had strongly criticised [[Hitler]] since the early 1930s, and from an early date her books were banned in [[Nazi Germany]].

She is also the Chair of Institute for Asian Democracy in Washington D.C. and a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Nova Southeastern University]]. She lectures widely on topics of peace, education, inter-cultural and inter-faith understanding, anti-extremism, and [[children's rights]].\n\nWilliams is a founding member of the Nobel Laureate Summit, which has taken place annually since 2000.<ref>{{cite news |title=14th Nobel Peace Laureate Summit takes place in Rome |first= |last= |url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/news/434728--14th-nobel-peace-laureate-summit-takes-place-in-rome  |newspaper=Anadolu |publisher=AA |date=12 December 2014 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Williams became a founder of the [[Nobel Women's Initiative]] along with Nobel Peace Laureates [[Mairead Corrigan Maguire]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], [[Wangari Maathai]], [[Jody Williams]] and [[Rigoberta Menchu Tum]]. These six women representing North and South America, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, bring together their experiences in a united effort for peace with justice and equality.  It is the goal of the Nobel Women's Initiative to help strengthen work being done in support of [[women's rights]] around the world. Williams also is a member of [[PeaceJam]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliams was born on 22 May 1943 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Her father worked as a butcher and her mother was a house wife. Betty received her primary education from St. Teresa Primary School in Belfast and attended St. Dominic\u2019s School for her high school studies. Upon completing her formal education, she took up a job of office receptionist.\n\nRare for the time in Northern Ireland, her father was Protestant and her mother was Catholic; a family background from which Williams later said she derived religious tolerance and a breadth of vision that motivated her to work for peace. Early in the 1970s she joined an anti-violence campaign headed by a Protestant priest. Williams credits this experience for preparing her to eventually found her own peace movement, which focused on creating peace groups composed of former opponents, practicing confidence-building measures, and the development of a grassroots peace process.<ref>{{cite news |title=Peace must be built from below |first=Betty |last=Williams |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1976/williams-facts.html |newspaper=Anadolu |publisher=AA |date=10 December 1976 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Peace petition==\nBetty Williams was drawn into the public arena after witnessing the death of three children on 10 August 1976, when they were hit by a car whose driver, an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] fugitive named Danny Lennon, was later fatally shot by British police.<ref name=\"virginia.edu\">[http://www.virginia.edu/nobel/laureates/bios/williams_bio.html Nobel Peace Laureates Conference]</ref> Williams was driving in her car with one of her own children when she heard gunfire. As she turned the corner to her home, she saw the three Maguire children and rushed to help. Their mother, Anne Maguire, who was with the children, eventually committed suicide in 1980 after a failed attempt to start a new life in New Zealand.\n\nWilliams was so moved by the incident that within two days of the tragic event, she had obtained 6,000 signatures on a [[petition]] for peace and gained wide media attention. She co-founded the Women for Peace which later, with co-founder [[Ciaran McKeown]], became '''The Community for Peace People'''.\n\nWilliams soon organised a peace march to the graves of the slain children, which was attended by 10,000 Protestant and Catholic women. However, the peaceful march was violently disrupted by members of the Irish Republican Army, who accused them of being \"dupes of the British\".<ref name=\"virginia.edu\"/> The following week, Williams led another march that concluded successfully without incident \u2013 this time with 35,000 participants.  \n\nAt that time, Williams declared the following:\n\n==Declaration of the Peace People==\nFirst Declaration of the Peace People\n*We have a simple message to the world from this movement for Peace.\n*We want to live and love and build a just and peaceful society.\n*We want for our children, as we want for ourselves, our lives at home, at work, and at play to be lives of joy and Peace.\n*We recognise that to build such a society demands dedication, hard work, and courage.\n*We recognise that there are many problems in our society which are a source of conflict and violence.\n*We recognise that every bullet fired and every exploding bomb make that work more difficult.\n*We reject the use of the bomb and the bullet and all the techniques of violence.\n*We dedicate ourselves to working with our neighbours, near and far, day in and day out, to build that peaceful society in which the tragedies we have known are a bad memory and a continuing warning.<ref>[http://www.peacepeople.com/PPDeclaration.htm The Peace People Declaration<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Nobel Peace Prize==\nIn recognition of her efforts for peace, Williams, together with her friend [[Mairead Corrigan]], became joint recipients of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1977 (the prize for 1976).\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Williams said, <blockquote> \"That first week will always be remembered of course for something else besides the birth of the Peace People. For those most closely involved, the most powerful memory of that week was the death of a young republican and the deaths of three children struck by the dead man's car. A deep sense of frustration at the mindless stupidity of the continuing violence was already evident before the tragic events of that sunny afternoon of August 10, 1976. But the deaths of those four young people in one terrible moment of violence caused that frustration to explode, and create the possibility of a real peace movement...As far as we are concerned, every single death in the last eight years, and every death in every war that was ever fought represents life needlessly wasted, a mother's labour spurned\".<ref>[http://gos.sbc.edu/w/bwilliams.html Gifts of Speech \u2013 Betty Williams<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Other Awards==\nSince winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Williams has received the [[People's Peace Prize of Norway]] in 1976, the [[Schweitzer Medallion for Courage]], the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Award]], the [[Eleanor Roosevelt Award]] in 1984, and the [[Frank Foundation Child Care International Oliver Award]]. In 1995 she was awarded the Rotary Club International \"Paul Harris Fellowship: and the Together for Peace Building Award.\n\n==Talks and Guest Lectures==\nFrom 17 to 20 September 2007, Williams gave a series of lectures in Southern California with the theme \"Peace Is Action, Not Words.\" On 18 September, Mrs. Williams presented a lecture to the academic community of Orange County entitled \"Peace in the World Is Everybody's Business.\" On 20 September, she gave a lecture to 2,232 members of the general public, including 1,100 high school sophomores.\n\nSpeaking at the [[University of Bradford]] before an audience of 200 in March 2011, Williams warned that young Muslim women on campus were vulnerable to attacks from angry family members, while the university does little to help protect them. \"If you had someone on this campus these young women could go to say, 'I am frightened' \u2013 if you are not doing that here, you are dehumanising them by not helping these young women, don't you think?\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Bradford University is told it must do more to stop attacks on the vulnerable Muslim women |first=Jim |last=Greenhalf |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/local/localbrad/8891679.Nobel_prize_winner_s_appeal_to_protect_Muslim_women_in_Bradford/ |newspaper=[[Telegraph & Argus]] |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAt the time she received the Nobel Prize, Williams worked as a receptionist and was raising her two children with her first husband Ralph Williams. After they divorced, she married James Perkins in 1982, and resided in [[Ponte Vedra Beach]], Florida in the United States. She toured and lectured extensively, taking the Nobel Peace Prize with her, so others could see and be inspired by it. \n\nHer son [[Paul Williams (Northern Irish footballer)|Paul]] became a professional footballer playing for [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]],\n[[Hartlepool United]], [[Stockport County]], [[West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Rochdale]]. He made one appearance for Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 1992, she was appointed to the [[Texas Commission for Children and Youth]] by then Texas Governor, [[Ann Richards]].\n\nShe spent time as a visiting professor at [[Sam Houston State University]], in [[Huntsville, Texas]]. In 2004, she returned to live in Ireland where she currently resides.\n\n==In popular culture==\nBetty Williams was honoured/featured in the music video of [[Nickelback]]'s hit song [[If Everyone Cared]].\n\nBetty Williams and Mairead Corrigan were also the subject of a French song, \"Deux Femmes \u00e0 Dublin\", sung by French Pied Noir singer Enrico Macias.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of female Nobel laureates]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nobel.se/peace/laureates/1976/index.html Nobel Committee information on 1976 Peace Laureates]\n* http://lectures.syr.edu/betty-jody-williams \u2013 brief bio\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028055921/http://www.geocities.com/socialistparty/Archive/1976OctPP.htm Peace People in NI \u2013 a socialist position]\n*{{C-SPAN|Betty Williams 02}}\n{{commons category|Betty Williams (Northern Ireland)}}\n\n{{Nobel Peace Prize laureates}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Betty}}\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:British Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Expatriates from Northern Ireland in the United States]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates from Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Nobel Peace Prize laureates]]\n[[Category:People from Belfast]]\n[[Category:People of The Troubles (Northern Ireland)]]\n[[Category:People of the Year Awards winners]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic activists]]\n[[Category:Sam Houston State University faculty]]\n[[Category:Women in Northern Irish politics]]\n[[Category:Women Nobel laureates]]"}]},"314124":{"pageid":314124,"ns":0,"title":"Jody Williams","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{other uses}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2011}}\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name = Jody Williams\n| image = JodyWilliamsMay2010.jpg\n| caption = Williams in May 2010.\n| birth_name = \n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1950|10|09}}\n| birth_place = [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland]], [[Vermont]], [[United States]]\n| resting_place = \n| resting_place_coordinates = \n| residence = \n| nationality = United States\n| other_names = \n| known_for = 1997 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n| education = {{unbulleted list |[[University of Vermont]] |{{nowrap|[[School for International Training]]}} |[[Johns Hopkins University]]}}\n| employer = \n| occupation = \n| title = \n| predecessor = \n| successor = \n| religion = \n| spouse = \n| partner = \n| children = \n| parents = \n| relatives = \n| signature = \n| website = \n}}\n\n'''Jody Williams''' (born October 9, 1950) is an American political activist known around the world for her work in banning [[Anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel]] [[Land mine|landmine]]s, her [[human rights defender|defense of human rights]]{{spaced ndash}}especially those of women{{spaced ndash}}and her efforts to promote new understandings of security in today\u2019s world.

Three weeks later, she and the ICBL were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At that time, she became the tenth woman \u2013 and third American woman \u2013 in its almost hundred-year history to receive the Prize.  \n \nIn November 2004, after discussions with sister Peace Laureates Dr. [[Shirin Ebadi]] of Iran and the late Professor [[Wangari Maathai]] of Kenya, Williams took the lead in establishing the [http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org Nobel Women\u2019s Initiative] launched in January 2006; she since has served as its Chair. Through this Initiative, which brings together six of the female Peace Laureates alive today, the women seek to use their access and influence to support and promote the work of women around the world working for peace with justice and equality. ([[Aung San Suu Kyi]] is an honorary member.)\n\nIn an interview with ''Real Leaders'' magazine in 2015, Williams is quoted as saying, \"The image of peace with a dove flying over a rainbow and people holding hands singing kumbaya ends up infantilizing people who believe that sustainable peace is possible. If you think that singing and looking at a rainbow will suddenly make peace appear then you\u2019re not capable of meaningful thought, or understanding the difficulties of the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Jody Williams Admits, \"I\u2019m No Mother Theresa.\"|url=http://real-leaders.com/nobel-peace-laureate-jody-williams-admits-im-no-mother-theresa/|website=Real Leaders|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Academic career ==\nSince 2007, Williams has been the Sam and Cele Keeper Professor in Peace and Social Justice in the Graduate College of Social Work at the [[University of Houston]].

Her work includes articles for magazines and newspapers around the world (e.g., Wall Street Journal, International Herald Tribune, The Independent (UK), The Irish Times, The Toronto Globe and Mail, The LA Times, La Jornada (Mexico), The Review of the International Red Cross, Columbia University\u2019s Journal of Politics and Society) and chapters to numerous books (e.g., ''This I Believe:  The Personal Philosophies of Remarkable Men and Women'', edited by Jay Allison and Dan Gediman [this book is the result of the \u201cThis I Believe\u201d series on National Public Radio]; ''A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant, and A Prayer'', edited by Eve Ensler; ''Lessons from our Fathers'', by Keith McDermott; ''Girls Like Us: 40 Extraordinary Women Celebrate Girlhood in Story, Poetry and Song'', by Gina Misiroglu; ''The Way We Will be 50 Years from Today: 60 of the World\u2019s Greatest Minds Share Their Visions of the Next Half-Century'', edited by Mike Wallace).\n\nWilliams also co-authored a seminal book on the landmine crisis in 1995, ''After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines'' (Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, Washington, DC). Her most recent book, ''Banning Landmines: Disarmament, Citizen Diplomacy and Human Security'', edited with Steve Goose and Mary Wareham, analyzes the Mine Ban Treaty and its impact on other human security- related work. It was released at the end of March 2008 by Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. In March 2013, her memoir, ''My Name Is Jody Williams: A Vermont Girl\u2019s Winding Path to the Nobel Peace Prize'' (University of California Press) was released.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of female Nobel laureates]]\n* [[List of peace activists]]\n* [[PeaceJam]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Jody Williams}}\n*[http://videostreaming.udlap.mx/udla/nobel/jodywilliams.asx \"An Individual's Impact on Social and Political Change\"]\n*[http://aljazeera.com/programmes/oneonone/2011/03/2011329121630705386.html ''One on One \u2013 Jody Williams''], interview by Riz Khan on [[Al Jazeera English]], March 2011 (video, 25 mins).\n*{{C-SPAN|Jody Williams}}\n\n{{Nobel Peace Prize Laureates 1976-2000}}\n{{1997 Nobel Prize winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Jody}}\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Mine action]]\n[[Category:Nobel Peace Prize laureates]]\n[[Category:American Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:American anti-war activists]]\n[[Category:American human rights activists]]\n[[Category:American humanitarians]]\n[[Category:University of Vermont alumni]]\n[[Category:SIT Graduate Institute alumni]]\n[[Category:Paul H.

Not believing that any good graduate school would admit and provide financial support to a woman, she took a job as a secretary to [[Michael Heidelberger]], another biochemist at Columbia, who hired her on the condition that she studied [[stenography]]. She graduated from [[Hunter College]] in January 1941.<ref name=\"autobiography\" />\n\nIn mid-February of that aforementioned year she received an offer of a teaching assistantship in physics at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] with the primary reason being that [[World War II]] commenced and many men went off to war and the university decided to offer scholarships for women rather than shut down. That summer she took two tuition-free physics courses under government auspices at [[New York University]]. At the [[University of Illinois]], she was the only woman among the department's 400 members, and the first since 1917. She married fellow student Aaron Yalow, the son of a rabbi, in June 1943. They had two children and kept a kosher home.<ref name=\"JVL\">{{cite news|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Yalow.html|title=Rosalyn S.

There she collaborated with [[Solomon Berson]] to develop [[radioimmunoassay]] (RIA). RIA is a [[radioactive tracer|radioisotope tracing]] technique that allows the measurement of tiny quantities of various biological substances in human blood as well as a multitude of other [[aqueous]] fluids. RIA testing relies on the creation of two reagents. One reagent is a [[molecule]] that is the product of [[covalently]] [[Covalent bond|bonding]] a [[radioactive]] [[isotope]] [[atom]] with a molecule of the target. The second reagent is an antibody which specifically chemically reacts with the target substance. The measurement of target signal is done using both reagents. They are mixed with the fluid containing an unknown concentration of target to be measured. The radioactive atom supplies a signal that can be monitored. The target supplied from the unknown concentration solution displaces the radiolabelled target bond to the antibody. Originally used to study [[insulin]] levels in [[diabetes mellitus]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yalow | first1 = RS | last2 = Berson | first2 = SA | year = 1960 | title = Immunoassay of endogenous plasma insulin in man | url = | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 1157\u201375 | doi = 10.1172/JCI104130 | pmid = 13846364 | pmc=441860}}</ref> the technique has since been applied to hundreds of other substances \u2013 including [[hormone]]s, [[vitamin]]s and [[enzyme]]s \u2013 all  too small to detect previously.

While a postdoc at MIT she spent some time in the lab of subsequent 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry Nobel Prize]] winner [[William Lipscomb|William N. Lipscomb, Jr.]] of [[Harvard University]] where she was inspired to pursue very large structures.<ref name=CEN_Nov_2009/>\n\nIn 1970, she established what was for nearly a decade the only [[protein]] crystallography laboratory in Israel. Then, from 1979 to 1984 she was a group leader with [[Heinz-G\u00fcnter Wittmann]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics]] in Berlin. She was visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1977-78.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/news.php?asset_id=1729|title=New chemistry Nobelist was UChicago visiting prof, conducted research at Argonne|author=anonymous|work=uchicago.edu}}</ref> She headed a [[Max-Planck Institute]] Research Unit at [[DESY]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany (1986\u20132004) in parallel to her research activities at the Weizmann Institute.\n\nYonath focuses on the mechanisms underlying [[protein biosynthesis]], by ribosomal crystallography, a research line she pioneered over twenty years ago despite considerable skepticism of the international scientific community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/speedread.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 - Speed Read|work=nobelprize.org}}</ref> Ribosomes translate [[RNA]] into protein and because they have slightly different structures in microbes, when compared to [[eukaryote]]s, such as human cells, they are often a target for antibiotics. In 2000 and 2001, she determined the complete high-resolution structures of both ribosomal subunits and discovered within the otherwise asymmetric ribosome, the universal symmetrical region that provides the framework and navigates the process of polypeptide polymerization. Consequently, she showed that the ribosome is a [[ribozyme]] that places its substrates in [[stereochemistry]] suitable for [[peptide bond]] formation and for substrate-mediated [[catalysis]]. In 1993 she visualized the path taken by the nascent proteins, namely the ribosomal tunnel, and recently revealed the dynamics elements enabling its involvement in elongation arrest, gating, intra-cellular regulation and nascent chain trafficking into their folding space.\n\nAdditionally, Yonath elucidated the modes of action of over twenty different [[antibiotic]]s targeting the ribosome, illuminated mechanisms of [[drug resistance]] and [[drug synergy|synergism]], deciphered the structural basis for antibiotic selectivity and showed how it plays a key role in clinical usefulness and therapeutic effectiveness, thus paving the way for structure-based [[drug design]].\n\nFor enabling ribosomal crystallography Yonath introduced a novel technique, [[cryo bio-crystallography]], which became routine in structural biology and allowed intricate projects otherwise considered formidable.<ref>Hope, H., Frolow, F., von Bohlen, K., Makowski, I., Kratky, C., Halfon, Y., Danz, H., Webster, P., Bartels, K.
