In 2002, widespread protests forced Hindustan Lever Ltd. (the Indian subsidiary of London-based Unilever) to cancel  a television ad campaign for its fairness cream because of its portrayal of women. The campaign was built around the theme of a father lamenting \"If only I had a son\" while showing his problem: a dark-skinned, unattractive daughter. Fast-forward. She uses the [[Fair & Lovely (cosmetics)|Fair & Lovely]] cream and has become a gorgeous light-skinned beauty. Clad in a stylish miniskirt, she is a successful airline flight attendant and takes her proud father to dine at a five-star hotel. AIDWA lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi. It argued endorsing the traditional preference for sons strengthens gender discrimination, which is a major problem in India. Furthermore, said AIDWA, the ad perpetuated a culture of discrimination in a society where \"fair skin\" is synonymous with \"beautiful.\"  The government's Ministry of Information and Broadcast sided with AIDWA and directed stations not to air the ads because they violated the Cable and Television Networks Act of 1995 which states that no advertisement shall be permitted which \"derides any race, caste, color, creed and nationality\" and furthermore states that, \"Women must not be portrayed in a manner that emphasizes passive, submissive qualities and encourages them to play a subordinate secondary role in the family and society.\"  The minister told Parliament that if broadcasters do not regulate ad content the government will be forced to do so. The Mumbai-based Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a body of advertisers and media agencies, insisted that it should do the regulating not the government. ASCI had already told Hindustan Lever that its ad campaign was offensive and it was ended.<ref>Arundhati Parmar, \"Objections to Indian ad not taken lightly\" ''Marketing News'' (9 June 2003) 37#12 pp 4-9</ref>\n\n==National Conference of AIDWA==\nThe first National Conference of AIDWA was held at [[Chennai]] in 1981, with delegates from 12 states representing 590,000 members.

On January 13, 1913, the entire twenty-two-member undergraduate chapter voted to transform the original Alpha Kappa Alpha into [[Delta Sigma Theta]].

The audit was expected to be concluded sometime in January 2012.<ref name=\"Audit pdf\" />\n\n===Hazing death lawsuit===\nOn September 9, 2002, pledges Kristin High (22 years old mother of one) and Kenitha Saafir (24 years old) from California State University \u2013 Los Angeles (CSULA), were pronounced dead as a result of an illegal pledging ritual. The women were instructed by members of Alpha Kappa Alpha to perform a series of activities blindfolded on Dockweiler State Beach when a high tide came and eventually drowned both of them.  The next day when sorority members brought Kristin's car and cellphone to her mother, she noticed Kristin's pledge journal suddenly missing and numbers deleted from her cellphone. Prior to Kristin's death, Kristin's mother encouraged her to fully disassociate herself from the sorority after Kristin discussed the unsisterly behaviors displayed by members of AKA such as disrespecting pledges and forcing them to run late night errands for AKA members. A year after the tragic incident, the families of the deceased settled with Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated after filing a $100 million wrongful death lawsuit. The sorority initially denied having an active chapter at CSULA in an effort to deny responsibility for the deaths but the court dismissed their claim and held the whole sorority accountable.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.laweekly.com/news/drowning-deaths-remembered-2138857| work= LA Weekly| title= Drowning deaths remembered| first = Christine| last= Pelisek | date= September 23, 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Alpha Chapter hazing lawsuit===\nTwo Howard University seniors filed a lawsuit against Alpha Kappa Alpha Incorporated in 2013.  The women accused the sorority of barring them from membership through the most prestigious chapter of the sorority, Alpha Chapter, despite being \"legacies\" (their mothers were members of the sorority) and in retaliation for reporting illegal hazing. The mothers eventually had their AKA membership revoked for supporting their daughters in the litigation process against the sorority.  In the lawsuit, the women stated that as prospective members of the Alpha Chapter they were verbally abused by women of the sorority, could not wear sorority colors or any colors that could be blended into pink or green, they could not wear pearls, they were forced to run errands and buy items for sorority members,  they could not socialize with their non-AKA friends, they were often humiliated in front of other students, they could not eat at a popular lunch spot on campus, they could not use the same doors as sorority members, and at one point they had to call their \"big sisters\" daily or suffer some type of consequence.  The women were denied their only opportunity to join the Alpha Chapter of the sorority before they graduated because the chapter was suspended from bringing in new members following an investigation of hazing allegations their previous eligible years.<ref>http://diverseeducation.com/article/66460/</ref>\n\n==Membership==\n{{further|List of Alpha Kappa Alpha sisters}}\n[[File:AKAheadquarters.jpg|240px|left|thumb|Alpha Kappa Alpha's National Headquarters in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]]]]\nAlpha Kappa Alpha reports a membership of over 283,000 women internationally.

The organisation is 70-80% self-funded through a number of commercial enterprises that include a dairy and food project and a chain of retail handicraft stores called [[Aarong]]. BRAC maintains offices in 14 countries throughout the world, including [[BRAC USA]] and BRAC UK.{{citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph lacks sources|date=July 2015}}\n\nBRAC considers itself to have a unique philosophy towards eradicating poverty. As one author has said, \"BRAC's idea was simple yet radical: bring together the poorest people in the poorest countries and teach them to read, think for themselves, pool their resources, and start their own businesses\".<ref name=\"Barber\" /> Sir Fazle Hasan Abed strongly believed that poverty alleviation could be achieved only through an improvement to multiple issues plaguing a country, which explains the vast range of programmes that BRAC is involved in. Furthermore, his conviction that poverty amelioration could only be sustained through greater equality in gender roles led BRAC to heavily advocate [[women\u2019s rights]] and the improvement of women's welfare.\n\nIn April 2009, ''Freedom from Want'', a book that traces the evolution of BRAC by author Ian Smillie, was published by [[Kumarian Press]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Fazle Hasan Abed.jpg|thumb|[[Sir Fazle Hasan Abed|Sir Fazl\u00e9 Hasan Abed]], founder of BRAC]]\n\nKnown formerly as the '''Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee''' and then as the '''Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee''' (currently, BRAC does not represent an acronym), BRAC was initiated in 1972 by [[Sir Fazle Hasan Abed|Sir Fazl\u00e9 Hasan Abed]]  at [[Sullah Upazila|Shallah Upazillah]] in the district of [[Sunamganj]] as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project to help returning war refugees after the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971. In nine months, 14 thousand homes were rebuilt as part of the relief effort and several hundred boats were built for the fishermen. Medical centres were opened and other essential services were ensured.<ref>Annual Report, 1990, BRAC</ref> At the end of 1972, when the first phase of relief work was over, BRAC turned towards long-term development needs and re-organised itself to focus on the empowerment of the poor and landless, particularly women and children.\n\nBy 1974, BRAC had started providing micro credit and had started analysing the usefulness of credit inputs in the lives of the poor. Until the mid-1970s, BRAC concentrated on community development through village development programmes that included agriculture, fisheries, [[cooperatives]], rural crafts, [[adult literacy]], health and family planning, vocational training for women and construction of community centres. A Research and Evaluation Division (RED) was set up by Dr. Mushtaque Chowdhury in 1975 to analyse and evaluate its activities and provide direction for the organisation to evolve. In 1977, BRAC shifted from community development towards a more targeted approach by organising village groups called Village Organisations (VO). This approach targeted the poorest of the poor \u2013 the landless, small farmers, artisans, and vulnerable women. Those who own less than half an acre of land and survive by selling manual labour were regarded as BRAC's target group. That same year BRAC set up a commercial printing press to help finance its activities. The handicraft retail chain called Aarong, was established the following year.\n\nIn 1979, BRAC entered the health field by establishing a nationwide Oral Therapy Extension Programme (OTEP), a campaign to combat [[diarrhoea]], the leading cause of the high child mortality rate in Bangladesh. Over a ten-year period 1,200 BRAC workers went door-to-door to teach 12 million mothers the preparation of home-made oral saline.  Bangladesh today has one of the highest rates of usage of [[oral rehydration therapy|oral rehydration]], and BRAC's campaign cut down child and infant mortality from 285 per thousand to 75 per thousand.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chowdhury |first1=A.

In 1991 the Women's Health Development program commenced. The following year BRAC established a Centre for Development Management (CDM) in Rajendrapur. Its Social Development, Human Rights and Legal Services programme was launched in 1996 with the aim to empower women with legal rights and assist them in becoming involved with community and ward level organisations. In 1998, BRAC's Dairy and Food project was commissioned. BRAC launched an Information Technology Institute the following year. In 2001, BRAC established a university called [[BRAC University]] with the aim to create future leaders and the BRAC Bank was started to cater primarily to small and medium entreprises.\n\nIn 2002 BRAC launched a programme called Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction \u2013 Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) designed specifically for those that BRAC defines as the ultra poor - the extreme poor who cannot access conventional microfinance. The same year BRAC also went into [[Afghanistan]] with relief and rehabilitation programmes. It was the first organisation in Bangladesh to establish, in 2004, the office of an Ombudsperson.\n\n==Objectives==\n{{Quote box|\n width=25%\n|align=right\n|quote=BRAC has done what few others have \u2013 they have achieved success on a massive scale, bringing life-saving health programs to millions of the world's poorest people.

It provides collateral-free credit using a [[solidarity lending]] methodology, as well as obligatory savings schemes through its Village Organisations.  Reaching nearly 4 million borrowers, Village Organisations provide loans to poverty groups. BRAC has reached out to those who, due to extreme poverty, cannot access microfinance. BRAC defines such people suffering from extreme poverty as the 'ultra poor', and has designed a programme customised for this group that combines subsidy with enterprise development training, healthcare, social development and asset transfer, eventually pulling the ultra poor into its mainstream microfinance programme.\n\n[[Microfinance]], introduced in 1974, is BRAC's oldest programme. It spans all districts of Bangladesh,<ref name=\"microfinance\">{{cite web |url=http://www.brac.net/content/microfinance |title=Microfinance |website=BRAC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625011027/http://brac.net/content/microfinance |archive-date=25 June 2011 |access-date=21 February 2012}}</ref> and is the largest microlending operation in the country, the renowned Grameen Bank being a close second.<ref name=\"Barber\">{{cite journal |last=Barber |first=Ben |date=May 2002 |title=No Free Lunch |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-86396661.html |journal=World & I |volume=17 |issue=5 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}</ref> It provides collateral-free loans to mostly poor, landless, rural women, enabling them to generate income and improve their [[standards of living]].<ref name=\"microfinance\" /> A typical BRAC loan is to buy chickens to raise for eggs and meat. In addition to the loan, BRAC teaches the borrower how to care for and raise the chickens, and provides access to low-cost, high-quality inputs. The emphasis is on self-empowerment.<ref name=\"Barber\" /> BRAC's microcredit program has funded over $1.9 billion in loans in its first 40 years. 95% of BRACs microloan customers are women.<ref name=\"AR2014\" /> According to BRAC, the repayment rate is over 98%.<ref name=\"Glance2012\" />\n\n[[Image:Jamindar Ginni Dolls from Aarong by Ragib Hasan.jpg|left|thumb|Jaminder-Ginni dolls made by village artisans. Handicrafts like these are sold by Aarong, BRAC's handicrafts store.]]\nIn addition to microfinance, BRAC provides enterprise training and support to its member borrowers in poultry and livestock, fisheries, [[social forestry]], agriculture and [[sericulture]]. It provides inputs essential for some enterprises through its 'Programme Support Enterprises' that include Poultry farm and disease diagnostic laboratory, Bull Station, Feed Mill, Broiler Production and Marketing, Seed Production, Processing, Marketing and Soil Testing, BRAC Nursery, and Fish and Prawn Hatchery.

Delta Sigma Theta Sorority was founded on January 13, 1913, by 22 collegiate women at [[Howard University]]. These students wanted to use their collective strength to promote academic excellence and to provide assistance to persons in need. The first public act of Delta Sigma Theta was the [[Women's Suffrage]] March in [[Washington D.C.]], on March 3, 1913. Today, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority is the largest African-American Greek-lettered organization.<ref name=\"FrostIllustrated\">{{cite web |url=http://www.frostillustrated.com/full.php?sid=1604 |title=Delta Sigma Theta, \"Black Sorority Project reach settlement agreement on film, painting| publisher=''Frost Illustrated''|accessdate=January 1, 2008}}</ref> Membership in Delta Sigma Theta is open to any woman who meets the membership requirements, regardless of religion, race, or nationality. Women may join through undergraduate chapters at a college or university, or through an alumnae chapter after earning a college degree.\n\nSince its founding, Delta Sigma Theta has been at the forefront of creating programming to improve political, education, and social and economic conditions. Delta Sigma Theta has been pivotal in assisting the African American and International communities through education, lobbying, and economic initiatives, including Delta Days at the State and Nation's Capitol, Delta Days at the United Nations, Summits and various conferences which focus on pertinent issues of the day. In addition to establishing independent programming, The Sorority consistently collaborates with community and corporate organizations such as [[Chase (bank)|Chase]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Lawry's]], and [[General Electric]] to further its programming goals.\n\nA sisterhood of more than 300,000 initiated members who are predominantly black college-educated Women, the sorority currently has over 940 chapters located in the [[Bahamas]], [[Bermuda]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]] ([[Tokyo]] and [[Okinawa]]), [[Liberia]], [[South Korea]],\n[[United States of America]] and [[Virgin Islands]]. Delta Sigma Theta is a member of multiple organizations, including the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] (NPHC) \u2013 an organization of nine international Greek-letter sororities and fraternities \u2013 as well as the [[NAACP]] and the [[National Council of Negro Women]] (NCNW). The current 25th national president is Dr. Paulette Camille Walker.\n\nThe organization kicked off its centennial year celebration by being the first Black Greek Lettered Organization to participate in the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] in [[Pasadena, CA]] on January 1, 2013 with a float entitled ''\"Transforming Communities through Sisterhood and Service.\"''\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation: 1912\u20131913===\n[[File:Purple African Violet Top.JPG|200px|left|thumb|African violet]]\n\nOn January 13, 1913, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated was founded by 22 [[Howard University]] undergraduate students who had earlier been initiated into the Alpha Chapter of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] sorority. Seven of them were the elected officers of Alpha Kappa Alpha: Myra Davis Hemmings, president; Ethel Cuff Black, vice-president; Edith Motte Young, secretary; Jessie McGuire Dent, corresponding secretary; Winona Cargile Alexander, custodian; Frederica Chase Dodd, [[sergeant-at-arms]]; and Pauline Oberdorfer Minor, treasurer. The 22 were dismayed at the lack of progress of Alpha Kappa Alpha to move beyond its function of orchestrating the affairs of campus society at Howard and wanted to reorganize the sorority to address higher purposes, like public service and women's advancement. The new initiates wanted to establish a national organization, enlarge the scope of the sorority's activities, and change its name to reflect a true purpose. They felt Alpha Kappa Alpha was solely a female derivative of the Beta Chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity with no individual meaning and were not \"Greek distinctive\" letters. They also wanted to change the symbols, change the sorority colors, and be more politically oriented. In 1912, these 22 undergraduates voted to change the organization's name to Delta Sigma Theta. This new name was to reflect the group's desire to change the direction of the group<ref name=\"Gid48\">Giddings 1998, op. cit., p. 48.</ref> and change in the philosophical underpinnings. The 22 undergraduate Alpha Chapter students sought to move towards social [[activism]] and greater [[public service]], rather than continue to focus on social activities.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite journal|last =Ross, Jr.|first =Lawrence C.|author-link =|last2 =|first2 =|author2-link =|title =The Divine Nine: The History of African-American and Sororities in America|place=|publisher =Kensington Books|year =|location =|volume =|edition =| url =| doi =| id =|isbn =|postscript = }}</ref> According to Delta Sigma Theta's historian [[Paula Giddings]], the 22 young women were concerned that since Alpha Kappa Alpha was not incorporated, there was no \"legal entity\". Since there was no charter, there was no authority to form other chapters, thus limiting their ability to enlarge the scope of activity.\"<ref name=\"Gid48\" />\n\nThe undergraduate members push to establish a national organization, to engage in activities that were national in scope, to change the sorority's name and symbols as well as to be more politically oriented<ref>Giddings 1988, op. cit., p. 49.</ref> caused conflict between one alumnae member who wished to keep the previous name and functional status quo, and the remaining collegiate Alpha Chapter members who voted to change the name of Alpha Kappa Alpha to Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.<ref name=\"History\" />  When the graduate member, [[Nellie Quander]], heard about the 22 students desire to change the sorority's name, colors and constitution, she disagreed and gave the students a deadline to stop the efforts to reorganize the sorority.<ref>Giddings, 1998, op. cit., p. 50-51.</ref>  The 22 declined and unanimously voted to reorganize, even prior to Delta Sigma Theta being approved by the Howard University administration.<ref>Giddings, 1998, op. cit., p. 51.</ref> Thus Delta Sigma Theta was founded on January 13, 1913, by the 22 students.<ref name=\"History\" /><ref name=\"History2\">{{cite web |url=http://skipmason.com/hm/hm04.htm |title=THE APA/DST Connection |author=Mason, Skip |date= |work= |publisher= }} Retrieved January 5, 2008.</ref> The new sorority was officially incorporated on February 18, 1913; making Delta the first sorority composed of undergraduate African American women to apply to the trustees of any university for the right to become an incorporated body.<ref>Giddings 1998, op. cit., p. 52</ref> On January 20, 1930, the organization's Grand Chapter was nationally incorporated. Delta Sigma Theta was one of the key African American organizations to participate in the Women's Suffrage March on March 3, 1913.\n\n===Development of infrastructure and programming: 1914\u20131930===\n\nImmediately following the founding, Delta Sigma Theta members quickly mobilized to build and develop infrastructure and implement programming. One of the first orders of business was to have an oath, which was written by [[Mary Church Terrell]] in 1914. In the early years, individual chapters would implement various programs to meet the needs of their local communities. The 1920s began a decade of significant development within Delta Sigma Theta. The organization began to develop uniformity in programming and communication between the chapters of the sorority. In 1920, May Week was inaugurated and the Official Publication of the Sorority was established as \"The Delta.\" Also in 1920, Omega Chapter was established to recognize deceased Sorors, and [[Sadie T.M. Alexander]] was voted first Honorary Grand President of Delta Sigma Theta. The Official Delta Sigma Theta Hymn, written by [[Florence Cole Talbert]] and [[Alice Dunbar Nelson]], was adopted in 1924. Regions were established in 1925, and the Jabberwock was established as the scholarship fundraiser. The scholarship and standards committee was established in 1929, and the organization was incorporated as a perpetual body in February 18, 1930.\n\n===Program expansion: 1931\u20131955===\n\nThe incorporation of the Sorority allowed for Delta Sigma Theta to improve expansion of chapters. Prior to incorporation as a perpetual body, new chapters were required to seek individual charters locally. However, with the national organization incorporated, chartering chapters became easier on regional leadership. The National Library Project was established in 1937 to provide access to books for Blacks in rural areas in the South where either no libraries were located, or they were not accessible to Blacks. The National Victory Book Drive occurred in 1943 to provide books to servicemen. In 1945, Delta Sigma Theta donated its first $1,000 to the [[United Negro College Fund]]. Also in 1945, Delta Sigma Theta, along with [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Zeta Phi Beta]], and [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] established the American Council on Human Rights which had the goal to \"mobilize the influence and resources of its members in the struggle for justice and equal opportunity for all U.S. Citizens.\"  While there were many struggles for minorities and women within the United States, Delta leadership also realized the great struggle others of African descent faced around the world, which led to the establishment of the first foreign chapter in [[Port-au-Prince]], Haiti in 1950. Given the great expansion of programming, and the increasing number of chapters and members, Delta Sigma Theta leadership realized there needed to be one central location in which all properties and records could be housed, and in 1953, Delta had the dedication of its first National Headquarters. In continuing with assisting persons in need abroad, Delta established the Maternity ward at Thika Memorial Hospital in 1955.\n\n===Further programs focused on women's and civil rights: 1956\u20131970===\n\nWhile Delta had previously moved toward having some uniformity of programming among chapters, with two international programs abroad, and being an organization that had served community for more than four decades, Delta wanted to ensure that all chapters would focus their programming around one national centralized theme. The Five Point Thrust was implemented in 1956 by 10th National President [[Dorothy Height]]. The five-point thrust are the five areas under which all Delta programming will fall. The thrust are Educational Development, Economic Development, Physical and Mental Health, Political Awareness and Involvement and International Awareness and Involvement. In 1960, Delta co-sponsored the National Organization of Women  for Equality in Education conference. In 1963, while celebrating their 50th Anniversary, Delta participated in the March on Washington, and established the Social Action Commission at the 27th National Convention. In 1966, Delta Teen Lift was established and the Delta Sigma Theta Executive Board was received in the White House by President Lyndon B. Johnson to discuss community issues and concerns in 1967. In 1968, the Unwed Mothers program was established, and in 1970 Delta sponsored the East African International Women's Seminar in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\n===Further emphasis on education: 1971\u20131975===\n\nWhile many strides had been made in the fifties and sixties to outlaw de jure segregation and discriminatory practices in schooling and public accommodations, much de facto discriminatory practices persisted. Delta understood the importance of education, and how educating communities would be essential in eradicating discrimination. In 1971, Delta and the Congressional Black Caucus co-sponsored National Policy Conferences on Education for Blacks, which focused on disparities and deficiencies in schools with high Black populations. The right to read program was established in 1973 to help the functionally illiterate. In 1975, Delta established life development centers to focus on issues placed by individuals from early childhood to senior citizens.\n\n===Call to action in support of women and mothers: 1976\u20131999===\n\nIn 1979, the [[Fortitude (King)]] sculpture was unveiled on the campus of Howard University.  \"Fortitude\" was originally surveyed as part of the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture survey in 1993.<ref name=\"SOS\">{{cite web|author=Save Outdoor Sculptures!|year=1993|title=Fortitude (sculpture) |work=SOS!|publisher=Smithsonian|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!324789~!0#focus|accessdate= December 14, 2010}}</ref>  The sculpture depicts a figure of a woman cut from a thin piece of metal.

The sculpture is described as symbolizing \"the attributes of strength, courage, hope, wisdom, beauty and femininity as depicted by the 22 founders of Delta Sigma Theta\".<ref name=\"Howard\"/>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Delta began holding \"Summits\" which focused on various issues within the African American Community. Delta felt the need to bring attention to issues that affect minorities and women that remained largely ignored in the United States. In 1981, Delta held Summit I which focused on issues affecting American Women. Summit II was a call to action in support of single parenting was held in 1984. The Delta Research and Education Foundation sponsored an international conference in Nassau, Bahamas entitled, \"Woman to Woman: Single parenting from a global perspective\" in 1987. In 1989, the School America program was established.\n\n===Enlarging the scope of national and international programming: 1990\u20132002===\n\nWith significant scope and depth in the existing programming, Delta members felt the need to establish programming that enlarged the scope and reach of sorority activity. The First Delta Days in the Nations Capital was held in 1990 in Washington, D.C. At the event Delta members met with congressional members to discuss policy that affected minorities and women. In 1992, Delta Sigma Theta became the first African American organization to collaborate with [[Habitat for Humanity]], and has built hundreds of houses for those in need. Delta held its Summit III, preparing young men for manhood, in 1993, in response to alarming drop out and incarceration rates among young men. And in 1996, in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity, Delta traveled to Ghana and built 40 homes. Delta adopted the Adelaide Tambo school for the Physically Disabled in South Africa. In that same year, Delta received $1.6 million from NSF for project SEE [Science and Everyday Experiences], and traveled to Swaziland, South Africa to break ground for the Delta house that would be housing for children who became orphans due to their parents dying from HIV/AIDS, and dedicated the computer training center in Lesotho.

However they wanted to ensure that any new chapters would maintain the same high scholastic and other standards of its members and that they would be properly initiated. The sorority initially expanded with a second chapter, Beta, established at [[Wilberforce University]], February 5, 1914.<ref>Giddings 1988, op. cit., p. 69-70.</ref> The third chapter, Gamma, was established in 1918 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

The first graduate chapters were authorized in 1920 at the Second National Convention for graduate members in New York City and Washington, D.C.<ref>Giddings 1988, op. cit., p. 86.</ref>  Delta Sigma Theta also sought to expand west of the Rocky Mountains with the chartering of the Kappa Chapter at the [[University of California]] in February 1921, Delta Sigma Theta became the first black Greek-letter organization established on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]].<ref>Giddings 1988, op. cit., p. 89.</ref> In 1930, the Grand Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority was incorporated as a perpetual body, which eliminated the need for each individual chapter to seek its own charter.<ref>Giddings 1988, op. cit., p. 125.</ref>\n\nDelta Sigma Theta realized the need for advocacy in the United States, and throughout the world. In 1962, DST chartered its first International Chapter in [[Monrovia]], Liberia. Delta Sigma Theta continues to Charter chapters throughout the United States and the world.

That year was a pivotal year for issues regarding race and equality in the United States. In January of that year, African-Americans celebrated the 50 year anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. And in February of the same year, Rosa McCauley (later [[Rosa Parks]]) the \"Mother of the Civil rights movement\" was born in Tuskegee, Alabama. In March 1913, the Women's suffrage march occurred, and the United States lost one of the most prolific freedom fighters the country has  ever seen, when [[Harriet Tubman]] died in New York. In May, Samuel Owensby, a Black man in Hogansville, Georgia was lynched near the local jail, after which his body was riddled with bullets. The nation's justice system condoned lynching in both southern and northern parts of the country. This violence was so entrenched in the United States that one report called the record of lynchings that year a \"small number\" based on a 13% decrease from the year prior.<ref>[http://blacklikemoi.com/2013/07/what-does-100-years-of-delta-sigma-theta-really-mean/ What does Delta Sigma Theta Turning 100 Really Mean?].

They work for the legalisation of prostitution and seek to reform laws that restrict [[human rights]] of sex workers.\n\n==History==\nOn 15 February 1992, a public health scientist Dr. Smarajit Jana of [[All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health]], Kolkata, visited the red-light area of [[Sonagachi]] for a HIV intervention research study. A [[peer education]] team was formed from amongst the sex workers and provided training. Shortly after, studies revealed larger issues amongst sex workers, such as sex workers rights, education of their children, access to financial services and handling of harassment by police and local thugs, along with promoting the use of condoms. Thus in 1995 he formed 'Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee' (DMSC) with 12 sex workers as stakeholders, by 2012 DMSC had a membership of 65,000 from 48 branches across the state of West Bengal, and continues to be managed by sex workers, their children and government officials as its board members, and has not just female sex workers as its members but also male and [[transgender]] sex workers.<ref name=mint2012/><ref name=history>[http://www.durbar.org/html/history.asp History of Durbar]</ref><ref name=ba>[[#Ba|Bagchi, p. 124]]</ref>\n\nSince its inception, it has been working as an [[advocacy group]] for sex workers and over the years, it has worked towards sensitizing general public about rights of sex workers, often initiating debate and discussion in public media and press, besides advocating abolition of 'The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956' (PITA), and legalisation of sex work.<ref name=ba/> Many sex workers now have voters identity cards, health insurance and even bank accounts. In 1995, its [[consumer cooperative]] society and [[micro-credit]] programme, 'Usha' (literally meaning light), ensured that the [[Government of West Bengal]] altered the state's cooperative law to register it as a sex workers [[cooperative]], instead of a 'housewives cooperative' under the prevalent state laws. By 2006-2007, small saving of its 5,000 members lead to an annual turnover to {{INRConvert| 9.75|c}}, with loan of  {{INRConvert| 2.12|c}} distributed amongst its members, which also helped break the monopoly of local moneylenders, who would charge interest rates of up to 300%.<ref name=mint2012/> The DMSC hosted India's first national convention of sex workers on 14 November 1997 in Kolkata, titled 'Sex Work is Real Work: We Demand Workers Rights'.<ref>[http://www.nswp.org/rights/dmsc/indiaconf.html Sex work is real work: We demand workers rights], announcement of the 1997 sex worker convention</ref>\n\nDMSC runs 17 non-formal schools for children of sex workers, and two hostels, one at [[Ultadanga]] and the other at [[Baruipur]].  Its cultural wing, 'Komol Gandhar', teaches dance, drama, mime and music to children, who invited regularly for paid shows.\n\n==HIV/AIDS project==\n\nThe Durbar runs the STD/HIV Intervention Programme (commonly known as the [[Sonagachi|Sonagachi Project]]) since 1999.

Through public awareness campaigns, a campaign school, election tracking, and lobbying the political parties, Equal Voice seeks to increase the numbers of women elected to public office federally, provincially and municipally.\n\n==Electing women in Canada: challenges and strategies==\nIn order to ensure that more women are elected in Canada, it is critical that Canada\u2019s political parties adopt action plans to break down barriers for women in politics. Equal Voice encourages the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]], the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] and the [[Green Party of Canada]], to be proactive in their recruitment and support of women candidates.\n\n==Regional and youth chapters==\nEqual Voice Chapters and University Campus Clubs aim to increase public awareness about the underrepresentation of women in politics by hosting events and providing networking and mentoring opportunities across Canada. In order to found a chapter, leaders must prove they support a multi-partisan approach to promoting the cause of electing more women in politics. \nChapters must be devoted solely to the cause of electing more women. There are currently chapters in Ottawa, Toronto, Alberta South, Alberta North, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In addition to regional chapters, there are student chapters at: The University of McGill, The University of Ottawa, [[Carleton University]] and [[York University]], with chapters quickly emerging across the country.\n\nLaunched on [[International Women's Day]] (2010), \"Be Her or Support Her\"is an action campaign created to galvanize women into being the candidate or support another woman to do so.<ref>[http://www.equalvoice.ca/speaks_article.cfm?id=291 \"EQUAL VOICE TAKES A STEP FURTHER ON INTERNATIONAL WOMEN\u2019S DAY 2010 WITH LAUNCH OF \u2018BE HER OR SUPPORT HER\u2019 CAMPAIGN\"], ''Equal Voice Press Release'', March 5, 2010</ref>  Members can take part in this specific campaign by taking individual action, through community initiatives, or by political party action.

In May 2009, EV launched its second Canada Challenge, where in anticipation of the next federal election, Equal Voice secured the commitment of the five federal party leaders to nominate more women to run for their parties. This resulted in an increase in the numbers of women nominated and elected in 2011,from 22 percent of parliament after the 2008 election to 25 percent of parliament after the 2011 election.\n\n'''The Ontario Challenge''' was created to help elect more women to Queen\u2019s Park.  In 2006, Equal Voice asked the leaders of the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]], Liberals and New Democratic Party to commit to nominating more female candidates.  All three party leaders agreed to take up the Challenge, and as a result, the number of women elected to Queen\u2019s Park in one election cycle increased by 7 per cent overall.\n\n'''Getting to the Gate Online Campaign School'''<ref>[http://www.equalvoice.ca/gate.htm], ''Getting to the Gate Online Campaign School''</ref> is an online campaign school that provides practical tools for women of all ages, backgrounds and walks of life interested in running for public office in order to boost women\u2019s participation in all levels of government.  The course is led by Equal Voice and funded by Status and Women Canada, and was made possible by the contributions of many individuals and organizations.\n\n'''EVE Awards: Honouring Outstanding Women''' is awarded by Equal Voice to recognize significant achievements by women in political life and efforts to promote women in politics in Canada.

As of November 2009, EWL membership extends to organisations in all 27 EU member states and the three candidate countries, as well as to 21 European-wide bodies, representing a total of more than 2500 organisations.\n\nWith a Secretariat based in Brussels, Belgium, the EWL is one of the longest-standing European level NGOs, and works closely with European Institutions and civil society partners. At the international level, the EWL has consultative status at the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], and participates regularly in the activities of the [[UN Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW).\n\nThe EWL's mission is to work towards the promotion and respect for women\u2019s human rights, by supporting diversity among women and equality between women and men. The EWL seeks to voice the concerns of its member organisations across Europe by means of active policy and advocacy work, project-management, monitoring and awareness-raising across different policy areas. These include women\u2019s economic and social position, women in decision-making, sexual and reproductive health and rights, immigration, integration and asylum. The EWL, through its European Policy Action Centre on Violence Against Women (EPAC-VAW), also works to combat all forms of violence against women. The EWL's EPAC-VAW also manages a dedicated European Observatory on this issue. Furthermore, the EWL supports the use of gender mainstreaming for the effective incorporation of a women's rights perspective into all European policies.\n\n==History==\nIn November 1987 in London 120 women, members of 85 organisations representing 50 millions individual members, came together and adopted two resolutions. The first called for the \u2018creation of a structure for influence, open to all interested women\u2019s organisations, to exert pressure on European and national institutions to ensure better defence and representation of women\u2019s interest\u2019. In a second resolution, the delegates called upon [[European Commission|the European Commission]] to \u2018lend its support for the organisation in early 1988 of a meeting with a view to the implementation of such a structure\u2019. Support was granted and the European Women\u2019s Lobby and its secretariat in Brussels were formally established in 1990. The EWL was founded in 1990 by Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] and [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] national coordinations and 17 large European-wide women\u2019s organisations.\n\nAt the time just twelve countries formed the European Union, then known as the European Communities (EC). Over the years, as new Member States joined the EC, new national co-ordinations became members of the EWL. While the EU enlarged to countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the EWL established links and cooperation with women\u2019s organisations in these countries.\n\nThe EWL currently has national co-ordinations in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,Cyprus, [[Czech Republic|the Czech Republic]], Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. 21 European-wide member organisations are also members of the EWL. All these represent approximately 2500 direct member organisations.\n\nThe European Women\u2019s Lobby was created in response to a growing awareness of the need to defend women\u2019s interests at the European level since:\n\n* Equality between women and men is one of the missions of the European Union, which has a strong competence to adopt legislation in this area affecting all women and men living in Europe.\n* The scope of the European Union\u2019s activities were and continue to be extending and affect areas with a direct effect on women\u2019s daily lives, particularly with the establishment of the [[internal market]].\n* It became urgent for women and their organisations to participate in the programmes established by the Union and to get acquainted with European legislation affecting them.\n* The creation of such an organisation and its designation of lobbying also corresponds to the particular character of the European-level decision-making process, which allows space for the creation of many organisations, founded to represent all types of interest groups and categories of the public (including various [[Economy (activity)|economic sectors]] as well as [[trade union]]s, professional and social grouping).\n* These organisations were responding to a real need on the part of the European institutions. Contrary to perceived ideas, the number of European officials is low, with only around 24000 people comprising the whole of the European Commission for example. The institutions therefore often call on experts in the course of their work, due in particular to the diversity of the Member States\u2019 people and legislation.\n* As decision-makers within the European institutions are not directly elected by the citizens, with the exception of the European Parliament, the creation of and organisation such as EWL also corresponds to the need to fill the democratic gap between the EU institutions and the citizens.\n\n==Objectives==\nThe European Women\u2019s Lobby, through its member organisations, aims:\n\n* To support the active involvement of women in working to achieve equality between women and men ensuring the representation of women form different parts of the European region.\n* To support national members through information, lobbying resources and training to actively engage with EU policy shaping and implementation of legislation at national level.\n* Through analysis, evaluation and monitoring to provide regular input on all areas of EU policy development and implementation that affect women\u2019s lives and on the promotion of equality between women and men with specific reference to the Roadmap for equality between women and men <ref>European Commission Roadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010 {{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/gender_equality/gender_mainstreaming/roadmap_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081221171447/http://ec.europa.eu:80/employment_social/gender_equality/gender_mainstreaming/roadmap_en.html |archivedate=December 21, 2008 }}</ref> and to the United Nation Beijing Platform for Action on Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.<ref>United Nation Beijing Platform for Action on Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women [http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/]</ref>\n* To monitor and raise awareness about the development and implementation of [[gender mainstreaming]] in order to ensure the full integration of [[Feminism|women\u2019s rights]], interests and perspective in all areas of EU policy.\n* To take into account the needs and perspective of different groups of women, and the diverse experiences of women at all stages of their life cycle. These actions take place both in its internal policy and organisational development as well as in developing partnerships and joint working relationships with organisations that represent the many women that face multiple discrimination in the European Union and globally.\n* To increase the number of women in decision making positions of power within the media industry. Currently only one third of those positions in the public sector are held by women and only one fourth of these positions are held by women in the private sector. Empowering women to take on those roles would lead to a more equal representation of sexualization of men and women in the media in Europe because currently mainly men are dictating what the media puts out.   \n\n==Policy areas==\n* '''Women in Decision Making''' [http://www.womenlobby.org/spip.php?rubrique36&lang=en]\n* '''Social Policy and Employment'''[http://www.womenlobby.org/site/1Template1.asp?DocID=19&v1ID=&RevID=&namePage=&pageParent=&DocID_sousmenu=&parentCat=19]\n* '''European Gender Equality Policies and Legislations'''[http://www.womenlobby.org/site/1Template1.asp?DocID=15&v1ID=&RevID=&namePage=&pageParent=&DocID_sousmenu=&parentCat=15]\n* '''Women's Diversity and Anti-Discrimination'''[http://www.womenlobby.org/site/1Template1.asp?DocID=20&v1ID=&RevID=&namePage=&pageParent=&DocID_sousmenu=&parentCat=20]\n* '''Migration and Asylum'''[http://www.womenlobby.org/site/1Template1.asp?DocID=534&v1ID=&RevID=&namePage=&pageParent=&DocID_sousmenu=&parentCat=534]\n* '''Fundamental Rights within the European Union'''[http://www.womenlobby.org/site/1Template1.asp?DocID=21&v1ID=&RevID=&namePage=&pageParent=&DocID_sousmenu=&parentCat=21]\n* '''Revision of European Treaties'''[http://www.womenlobby.org/site/1Template1.asp?DocID=18&v1ID=&RevID=&namePage=&pageParent=&DocID_sousmenu=&parentCat=18]\n* '''International Action for Human Rights/United Nations'''[http://www.womenlobby.org/site/1Template1.asp?DocID=22&v1ID=&RevID=&namePage=&pageParent=&DocID_sousmenu=&parentCat=22]\n* '''Violence Against Women''' [http://www.womenlobby.org/site/module_cate.asp?DocID=565&v1ID=&RevID=&namePage=&pageParent=&DocID_sousmenu=]\n* '''Women and the Media'''\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.womenlobby.org/site/hp.asp?langue=EN European Women's Lobby website]\n* '''European Policy Action Centre on Violence Against Women''' website [http://www.epacvaw.org/]\n* '''European Women's Lobby 50/50 Campaign  'No Modern European Democracy without Gender Equality' ''' [http://www.5050democracy.eu] - The 50/50 Campaign for Democracy led by the EWL in 2008-2009 seeks to ensure the equal representation of women and men in the European Institutions.\n* '''European Campaign for a strong new United Nations Women\u2019s agency''' [http://www.un-gear.eu/]\n* '''Nordic Baltic project''' website [http://www.nordicbaltic-assistwomen.net/] - The Nordic-Baltic Pilot Project is a three-year programme that aims to strengthen the cooperation and develop concrete activities to support and assist women victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation in the region.\n\n==European Institutions==\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/gender_equality/index_en.html '''European Commission and Gender equality''']\n* [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=EN&body=FEMM '''European Parliament Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee''']\n\n{{Women's lobbies, alliances and national committees}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights organizations]]"}]},"3231476":{"pageid":3231476,"ns":0,"title":"All-China Women's Federation","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{good article}}\n{{Infobox organization\n|name    = All-China Women's Federation \n|image   = File:All-China Women's Federation.svg\n|caption = Logo of the All-China Women's Federation\n|abbreviation = ACWF\n|type = [[Non-governmental organization]]\n|leader_title = President\n|leader_name = [[Shen Yueyue]]\n|leader_title2 = Vice President\n|leader_name2 = [[Song Xiuyan]]\n|website = [http://www.womenofchina.cn/ www.womenofchina.cn]\n|headquarters = [[Beijing]], People's Republic of China\n|main_organ = National Congress and Executive Committee\n|purpose = [[Women's rights]]\n|formation = 24 March 1949\n}}\nThe '''All-China Women's Federation''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:\u4e2d\u534e\u5168\u56fd\u5987\u5973\u8054\u5408\u4f1a, [[pinyin]]: ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 Qu\u00e1ngu\u00f3 Fu\u01f9\u01da Li\u00e1nh\u00e9hu\u00ec''), also known as the ACWF, is a women's rights organization established in [[China]] on 24 March 1949. It was originally called the '''All-China Democratic Women's Foundation''', and was renamed the All-China Women's Federation in 1957. It has acted as the official leader of the women\u2019s movement in China since its founding. It is responsible for promoting government policies on women, and protecting women\u2019s rights within the government.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-1949: Women\u2019s movement prior to the CCP and predecessors===\n\nThe early women\u2019s movement in China focused on eradicating the assumption that women were inferior to men.<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\"/> The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men. The [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing for the end of Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.\n\nWhen the CCP entered the [[First United Front]] to fight warlords and unite China from 1924\u201327 with the [[Guomindang]] (GMD), the each party established their own women\u2019s department during this time. However, the United Front ended with the [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]] (1927), where the GMD launched an attack to purge the communists and laborers. The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule. These territories were called soviets, and were the places the CCP fled to following the White Terror because they were not under the control of the GMD. The GMD championed traditional Confucian ideals about women, and they established the [[New Life Movement]], which sought to counter the gender role espoused by the CCP with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the GMD. The CCP's time in the soviets from 1927\u20131945 also gave them the opportunity to develop the skills for organizing federations and governing, which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later.<ref name=\"Howell, 2000 Tur.\">Howell, Jude. \"Organizing around women and labour in China: Uneasy Shadows, Uncomfortable Alliances.\" ''Communist and Post-Communist Studies'', no. 3 (2000): 355\u2013377.</ref>\n\nThe Chinese women\u2019s movement gained a new momentum with the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] (1937\u20131945).<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\" />  Leaders of the women's movement expressed [[nationalist]] sentiments in response to the threat the war posed to their daily lives. These leaders called for the liberation of  women to defend the nation. The number of official women\u2019s organization within the CPC at one of the soviets, Yan\u2019an, grew during the invasion. In March 1938, at the First Women\u2019s Congress held by the Women\u2019s Federation of [[Shaanxi|Shaan]]-[[Gansu|Gan]]-[[Ningxia|Ning]] (a forerunner to the ACWF) in a different communist-controlled area, the leaders of the women's movement began to form their nationalist ideas into an agenda. The women in attendance stated that the goal of the women\u2019s movement should be to unite women and to work together to liberate China. The First Women's Congress also outlined goals for the women's movement such as: helping women escape abusive marriages, improving women\u2019s health, eradicating the practice of foot binding, ending domestic abuse, and protecting women\u2019s inheritance rights.<ref name=\"Howell, 2000 Tur.\" />  The ACWF would adopt many of the same goals in 1949.<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\" />\n\n=== 1949\u20131966: Founding and early years===\n[[File:Cai Chang.jpg|thumb|[[Cai Chang]], the first president of the ACWF]]\nThe All-China Democratic Women\u2019s Federation was established on 24 March 1949 as China's first country-wide women\u2019s organization, and would be renamed the All-China Women's Federation later that year.<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\" />  Women who had been dominant in the women\u2019s movement and the CPC were included in the federation\u2019s leadership. [[Cai Chang]], a prominent leader in the women\u2019s movement since, an active CPC member, and a veteran of the Long March, was the first chair of the organization.<ref name=\"Tao Jie, 2004 yellow\">Tao Jie, Zheng Bijun, Shirley L.

In Ping-Chuna Hsiung, Maria Jaschok, and Cecilia Milwertz (eds), ''Chinese Women Organizing: Cadres, Feminist, Muslims, Queers'', Oxford: Berg, 2001.</ref> The ACWF soon developed beyond its original mission of promoting gender equality, and it became a tool used by the party to mobilize women for economic, political and ideological motives.<ref name=\"Howell, 2000 Tur.\" />\n\nThe early stages of the organization were characterized by a focus on [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology.<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\" /> The CPC viewed the women\u2019s movement as a part of the larger Chinese revolution against the feudal past, but some leaders in the CPC argued that because most of the women continued to do domestic work, and did not actively participate in the revolution, this contradicted the Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology. The ACWF contested this assertion, stating that the economic conditions were not at the point where jobs could be provided to all women. Therefore, housekeepers, wives and mothers who were dedicated to their work could indeed be seen as contributing to socialism.\n\nTo emphasize the contribution of women, the Five Good Family Campaign was introduced in 1956 to acknowledge efforts in areas such as education, managing the household, establishing connections with neighbors, keeping the house clean, and self-improvement. Promoting this campaign and ideology was important to the ACWF, and it encouraged local chapters to form women\u2019s congresses to spread the message.<ref name=\"Zheng pink\">Zheng, Wang. \"State Feminism? Gender and Socialist State Formation in Maoist China.\" ''Feminist Studies'', no. 3 (519\u2013551).</ref>  By 1953, there were over 40,000 officials working to spearhead local organizing campaigns.\n\nAround 1957, the ACWF entered a new phase, dropping \"Democratic\" from its name,<ref>Judd, Ellen R.

The CPC sought to use the ACWF to promote its gender-specific ideas and create a formal channel to mobilize women.<ref name=\"Howell, 2000 Tur.\" />  The ACWF also established affiliations with other mass movements: The YWCA of China and the Women Personnel Section of the Trade Union.<ref name=\"Bohong, 2001 green\">Bohong, Liu. \"The All-China Women's Federation and Women\u2019s NGOs\".

ACWF was able to reach out to women\u2019s movements abroad, and even hosted 23 delegations from other parts of the world for the Asia Women\u2019s Representative Conference in December 1949. This enabled the PRC to go around the diplomatic blockade and forge connections with other countries. However, soon the [[Cultural Revolution]] would begin in China, which forced the ACWF to discontinue many of its policies.\n\n===1966\u20131976: The ACWF and the Cultural Revolution===\n\nThe women's movement during the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u20131976), like other movements in this period, came to depend on the cult of [[Mao Zedong]].<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\" /> During the Cultural Revolution, the women\u2019s movement was viewed as bourgeois and reactionary since it had originated in the West. The ACWF shutdown in 1968 because it was considered anti-revolutionary. The party argued that the women\u2019s movement needed to be completely immersed in the revolutionary movement instead of harboring its own agenda. The offices of the ACWF were occupied by the army and many of the female cadres who had been involved with the women\u2019s movement were sent to labor camps in the countryside. Women\u2019s work ceased to function until the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976.\n\nThe committee for the 4th National Women\u2019s Congress met in 1976, started rehabilitating many of the female cadres sent to the countryside, and reinstated the ACWF. The ACWF was completely reestablished in 1978 and soon it announced its support for the Four Modernizations, Deng Xiaoping's plan to modernize agriculture, national defense, industry and technology in China. The newly reformed ACWF was able to strengthen its ability to set up local chapters,<ref name=\"Howell, 1996 orange\">Howell, Jude. \"The struggle for survival: Prospects for the Women's Federation in Post-Mao China\", ''World Development'', no. 1 (1996): 129\u2013143.</ref> but, while other federations were able to resume work in the early 1970s, he ACWF did not resume work on a national level until 1978.<ref name=\"Howell, 2000 Tur.\" />\n\n=== 1976\u2013present: NGO status in the reform era ===\n[[File:Chen Zhili UNDP 2009.jpg|thumb|Chen Zhili, former President of the All-China Women's Federation, in 2009.]]\nFollowing the Cultural Revolution, the All-China Women's Federation began to prioritize protecting women\u2019s rights and promoting equality over its responsibilities as an organ of the party.<ref name=\"Zhang, 2001 purple\" />  While the ACWF was responsible for communicating how the CPC had helped the women\u2019s movement, they also began to critique the previous actions taken during the women\u2019s movement as having been unsuccessful in the face of China\u2019s dominant [[patriarchy]].<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\" />  The ACWF increasingly studied women's movements in other countries, and held debates that transcended the parameters set by the CPC. ACWF campaigns became more diverse as they attempted to meet the disparate needs of the urban population and the rural population. While the ACWF continues to toe the party line, it is no longer involved in mass political campaigns. The party officially declared the ACWF a supervisory body in the early 1990s, so the ACWF is responsible for analyzing that effectiveness of the government in promoting women's rights. It was also approved to found for-profit businesses in 1992, so it less reliant on government financing, and more autonomous in setting its own agenda.\n\nThe new focus was on women's self-discovery; and the ACWF launched the Four Self Campaign consisting of: self-respect, self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reliance. An example of the ACWF balancing its government responsibilities with its responsibility to the women of China can be seen in the [[One-Child Policy]]. The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.\n\nThe ACWF also expanded its legal training for cadres, strengthened its finances, became involved with gay rights, fought employment discrimination and female trafficking, and introduced legislation to meet the challenges faced by women.<ref name=\"Howell, 2000 Tur.\" /> In 2000, ACWF developed jobs for one million unemployed women by creating small economic (for profit) entities in which women can work as family service aides or in women's service groups. The organization also helps China's \"leftover\" women.  These are women who remain unmarried after the age of 27. ACWF offers them alternatives to marriage such as the opportunity to pursue an education.<ref>Fincher, Leta Hong. [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/opinion/global/chinas-leftover-women.html?_r=0 \"China\u2019s \u2018Leftover\u2019 Women\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 11, 2012. Accessed March 18, 2013.</ref>  With these changes, the ACWF became less concerned with mobilizing grass roots organization, and focused on its role in setting the public discourse for the social and political issues of women.<ref name=\"Zheng pink\" />\n\nBy 1994 the organization had over 68,000  branches and somewhere between 80,000 and 90,000 cadres.<ref name=\"Howell, 1996 orange\" /> By 1995 the party declared  the ACWF, at least nominally, a non-governmental organization in response to criticism from women's groups abroad. However, the international women's movement questioned the validity of that declaration.<ref name=\"Yihong, 2004 blue\">Yihong, Jin. \"The All-China Women's Federation: Challenges and Trend\"s. In Ping-Chuna Hsiung, Maria Jaschok, and Cecilia Milwertz (eds), ''Chinese Women Organizing: Cadres, Feminist, Muslims, Queers'', Oxford: Berg, 2001.</ref> While the federation expanded in size, it became increasingly difficult to continue to reach all Chinese women through traditional channels.<ref name=\"Howell, 2000 Tur.\" />  Other NGOs appeared to fill some of the void, but many of those became incorporated within the federation to gain legitimacy. By the end of the 1990s there were 6,386 women\u2019s associations and recreational clubs under the ACWF umbrella.<ref name=\"Bohong, 2001 green\" />  The ACWF continues to struggle to reach an increasingly diverse female population in China, to incorporate groups outside the ACWF umbrella, and to defend its NGO status.\n\n==Organization==\n\n=== Actions and organizations===\n\nThe main action of the All-China Women's Federation is ''funu gongzuo'' (women\u2019s work).<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\">Ka Yee Tsui, Justina. \"Chinese Women: Active Revolutionaries or Passive Followers? A History of the All-China Women\u2019s Federation, 1949\u20131996.\" Master\u2019s thesis, Concordia University, 1998.</ref>  The federation currently has seven functional departments to carry out this work: the Department for Children, the International Liaison Department, the Department for Women\u2019s Development, the Publicity Department, the Department for Women\u2019s Rights and Interests, the Human Resources Development Department and the General Office.<ref name=\"Official Website\">All-China Women's Federation, [http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/folder/83-1.htm \"Women of China\"]. Accessed March 21, 2014.</ref> The ACWF maintains a strong connection to the CPC through the women\u2019s committees in the government. These committees cover topics ranging from systems of education, science, arts and medicine.<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\" /> The party still does have direct control over some aspects of the ACWF through cadres, who work within the federation who may be receiving a government salary, and through the government's power of promotion. The ACWF also has many affiliated organizations that expand its influence including: the China Women\u2019s Development Foundation, ''Marriage and Family Magazine'', the Legal Assistance Center of the ACWF, the China Women\u2019s Activity Center, the China Women\u2019s University, the China Women\u2019s News, the China Women\u2019s Publishing House, Women of China Magazine Publishing House.<ref name=\"Official Website\" />  Many of these affiliated organizations help distribute information to the women of China. The ACWF has over 49 newspapers and magazines, and major debates about the women\u2019s movement occur in its national journals the ''Women of China'', ''Chinese Women\u2019s Movements'', and ''Collection of Women\u2019s Studies''.<ref name=\"Zhang, 2001 purple\" />\n\n===Structure===\n\n==== Interaction with the Communist Party ====\n\nThough the All-China Women's Federation is officially labeled an [[NGO]], its longstanding relationship with the CPC means that the party still has interests in the federation and its members.<ref name=\"Yihong, 2004 blue\" />  The four levels of the federation still coincide with the state administrative system.<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\" />  The highest ranking body of the ACWF is the National Congress of Women which meets every five years. The National Congress Women studies reports sent to them from the Executive Committee of the ACWF, decide the goals for the women\u2019s movements, make changes to the constitution, and elect the Executive Committee and Standing Committees of the ACWF. Under this national level, the provincial level\u2019s women\u2019s congresses meet every three years to select their Executive and Standing Committees. However the local level must also carry out the directive and report to the CPC committee in addition to following the ACWF. This is supposed to give the organization a dual structure of carrying out party orders and informing the government of women\u2019s interests.\n\n==== Grass root versus upper levels of the ACWF====\n\nThe All-China Women's Federation is run from the national level with the provincial, municipal, county, district and village levels below it.<ref name=\"Yihong, 2004 blue\" />  However it is considered a nominal hierarchical structure because the Party controls each level over and above the jurisdiction of the ACWF. Instead of direct control, the higher levels provide guidance, ideas, and trainings to the levels below it. Some members have complained that women trained by the party are promoted more rapidly than women trained by the ACWF. Due to this perceived promotion rate, the grass roots members are incentivized to follow the demands of the party instead of the demands of the ACWF. Other members of the ACWF believe that the grassroots structure is successfully in touch with the women they are working for since they are on the front lines of the movement, and see little problem with the disconnect between the upper levels of the party and grassroots levels.<ref name=\"Howell, 1996 orange\" />\n\n=== Relationship with the women\u2019s movement===\n\nOne of the problems that the All-China Women's Federation has identified is that women in China do not understand the federation\u2019s contributions, or its significance in the women\u2019s movement.<ref name=\"Ka Yee Tsui, 1998 red\" />  The members of the ACWF identified two potential sources for the lack of understanding. The first is that the ACWF has many roles and branch organizations which may be obscuring the contribution it is making. The second is that it has lacked consistency in how it has represented women, especially during its early years. Another problem facing the ACWF is its relationship with the international women\u2019s movement.<ref name=\"Yihong, 2004 blue\" />  The relationship between the Marxist view of feminism and current international views on feminism are often viewed as contradictory. Marxism often labels feminist movements as bourgeois because it focuses on the betterment of only one segment of society instead of society as a whole, and states capitalism, not the patriarchy, is the creator of gender inequality. The ACWF struggles with how to engage both, sometimes denying to have borrowed anything from international feminism.\n\n==Challenges==\n\n=== Cooperation with outside women\u2019s groups===\n\nThe All-China Women's Federation is the largest women\u2019s organization in China and the only women\u2019s organization still in existence that appeared before the 1980s.<ref name=\"Yihong, 2004 blue\" /> However, the ACWF has recently been struggling to adequately represent a diverse range of women\u2019s interest, and some critics believe that women\u2019s growing needs ought to be represented by a more diverse group of organizations. Most women-interest NGOs operating in China are currently listed under the ACWF and have sought a close relationship with the organization to gain legitimacy and protection.<ref name=\"Bohong, 2001 green\" />  Some of the organizations that are listed outside the ACWF are run by women who are affiliated with the ACWF, so there is considerable overlap. New women's groups have more freedom in exploring sensitive topics and alternative theories on gender because they are not affiliated with the government in any manner.<ref name=\"Howell, 2000 Tur.\" />  The ACWF has encouraged some of these groups to form, and brought others under their umbrella, which extends the reach of the ACWF. However, given the limited resources available to the [[women\u2019s movement]], and the ACWF historically representing the only large organization, tensions exists between these women\u2019s groups and the ACWF.\n\n=== NGO status ===\n\nThe state officially labeled the All-China Women's Federation an NGO in 1995. Yet how applicable the term NGO is to the ACWF has been contested, given the ACWF\u2019s long and continuing relationship with the CPC.<ref name=\"Zhang, 2001 purple\" /> Some leaders in the women\u2019s movement opposed the ACWF attending an NGO forum in Manila in 1993 because they did not believe that it met the criteria of an NGO. Even the ACWF hesitates using the term NGO within China because it has been linked to anti-government groups, although it has embraced the title internationally. International donor agencies generally are more likely to work with NGO's, so the classification of an NGO has helped the ACWF obtain financing from international organizations.<ref name=\"Howell, 1996 orange\" />  Others believe that the ACWF classifies as an NGO because it has separated itself from the government in recent years, and still others believes that ACWF could be classified as a NGO if the definition was broadened.<ref name=\"Zhang, 2001 purple\" />  Those is support of this modified stance believe that complete separation from the government would be impossible and harmful to the ACWF. The ACWF continues to have internal and external debates about the NGO title.\n\n==See also==\n*[[GONGO|Government-operated non-governmental organization (GONGO)]]\n*[[Non-governmental organizations]]\n*[[Women in China]]\n*[[Feminism in China]]\n*[[Gender equality]]\n*[[Communist Party of China]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.women.org.cn}}\n*[http://www.womenofchina.cn/  English website]\n\n{{SexGenderPRChina}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Federation, All-China Womens}}\n[[Category:Organizations based in China]]\n[[Category:Women's rights organizations]]\n[[Category:Women's wings of political parties]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1949]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Beijing]]"}]},"50931615":{"pageid":50931615,"ns":0,"title":"Fiji Women's Rights Movement"},"50982594":{"pageid":50982594,"ns":0,"title":"Fondo Centroamericano de Mujeres"},"33944326":{"pageid":33944326,"ns":0,"title":"Fredrika Bremer Association"},"41152544":{"pageid":41152544,"ns":0,"title":"Freedom (charity)"},"33194845":{"pageid":33194845,"ns":0,"title":"Gender Equality Architecture Reform"},"27065823":{"pageid":27065823,"ns":0,"title":"Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"The '''Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre''' (Gender Centre) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that strives to address the issues of gender inequality in [[Ghana]].  Based in [[Accra]], Ghana, the Gender Centre has conducted studies on issues ranging from sexual and psychological violence against school girls to the ways in which social norms lead women to have a higher risk of HIV infection than men. The Centre works with local, national, and international organizations in its work towards addressing the problems facing women in Ghanaian society. The Gender Centre conducts research to provide both quantitative and qualitative data that will lead to new laws, fresh outlooks, and community discussions concerning women in this region of the world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre was founded in 1995. Since that time it has conducted numerous studies and published its findings in two books, ''Violence Against Women & Children In Ghana'' and ''Gender Norms, Violence Against Women, HIV/AIDS, a Case Study In Ghana.''<ref>Both works can be purchased through the Gender Centre by contacting them through their website [http://www.gendercentreghana.org]</ref>\n\n== Projects ==\n\nThe Gender Centre publishes its research,<ref>[http://www.gendercentreghana.org]</ref> as well as manuals, a semiannual newsletter, and an annual report, for other organizations and individuals to use in striving to combat women's inequality.\n\n===Nkyinkyim Anti-Violence Project===\nThe Gender Centre successfully conducted the Nkyinkyim Anti-Violence Project,<ref>http://www.gendercentreghana.org/activitydetail.php?id=1 Retrieved 23 April 2010.</ref> which began in 1998 and continues today. The project aims to abolish [[violence against women]] through conducting community-based research and pursuing a grassroots approach in which meetings with traditional leaders, religious leaders, and community members lead to local teams responsible for raising awareness, dealing with domestic violence crises, and counseling women who have been victims of violence. The project initially began with 3 communities and expanded in 2005 to include a total of 18 communities around Ghana.\n\n===Safe Schools Project===\nThe Safe Schools Project,<ref>http://www.gendercentreghana.org/activitydetail.php?id=2 Retrieved 23 April 2010.</ref> funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) endeavors to address the pressing issue of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of schoolgirls in Ghana. Over the course of two years the Gender Centre trained 120 counselors from thirty communities in the Central Region of Ghana to provide effective counseling to victimized school girls and to prevent further abuse by teachers and peers.\n\n===Ghanaian Women and HIV/AIDS===\nThe Gender Centre's most recent work concerns women's susceptibility to contracting [[HIV]] due to certain social norms and gender roles that exist in Ghanaian society.<ref>http://www.gendercentreghana.org/activitydetail.php?id=6 Retrieved 23 April 2010.</ref> For this qualitative research project, interviewers were trained to ask probing questions and used tape recorders in order to encourage conversation flow with the anonymous interviewees. The final report, published by the Gender Centre, is meant to complement empirical evidence already existing about the rate of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in [[West Africa]]. The Ghanaian government has adopted the popular ABCs of HIV prevention ([[abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]]), but the research by the Gender Centre shows that gender norms and domestic violence make this approach to combating the spread of HIV somewhat ineffective.<ref>''Gender Norms, Domestic Violence and Women's Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.'' Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre.</ref> Women in Ghana are traditionally sexually submissive, meaning that they are not always able to deny their male partners sex or insist on condom use. Men, on the other hand, are often free to take multiple sexual partners and even multiple wives. The practice of wife inheritance in which a widow will marry her deceased husband's relative can promote the spread of HIV as well, since the woman may have the virus herself or can contract it from her new husband's other wives or partners. Additionally, the social stigmatization faced by women already infected discourages them from revealing their positive status, putting others at risk for contracting the disease. After this initial research, the Gender Centre has been conducting meetings and workshops to raise awareness about how such social norms are putting women at a higher risk for contracting HIV. The Center endeavors to reverse these detrimental gender norms by holding support meetings in major cities all over the country and by running a series of radio shows about women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS conducted in the local languages of Twi, Ewe, and Wale, as well as English.\n\n==Collaborations==\n\nThe Gender Centre has collaborated with other organizations and agencies as it works to promote awareness about the issues facing women in Ghana today.

The basic principle of the IAW is that the full and equal enjoyment of [[human rights]] is due to all women and girls. It is one of the oldest, largest and most influential organizations in its field. The organization was founded in 1904 in [[Berlin]] by [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], [[Millicent Fawcett]] and other leading feminists to campaign for [[women's suffrage]]. Originally named the ''International Woman Suffrage Alliance'' (IWSA) and headquartered in [[London]], it was the preeminent international women's suffrage organization. Its emphasis has since shifted to a broad human rights focus. Today it represents over 50 organizations world-wide comprising several hundred thousand members, and has its seat in [[Geneva]].l\n\nFrom 1926, the organization had strong ties to the [[League of Nations]]. Since 1947, the IAW has had [[general consultative status]] to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the highest UN status possible for a non-governmental organization, the [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|4th organization to be granted this status]]. The IAW also has participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]]. It has representatives at the [[United Nations Headquarters|UN headquarters]] in [[New York City|New York]], the [[United Nations Office at Geneva|UN office]] in [[Geneva]], the [[United Nations Office at Vienna|UN office]] in [[Vienna]], [[UNESCO]] in [[Paris]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in [[Rome]] and the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]]. It also has representatives to the [[Arab League]] in [[Cairo]] and the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Countries Council]] in [[Riyadh]], and is an influential member of the [[European Women's Lobby]] in [[Brussels]]. Its President and Chief Representative to the United Nations is [[Joanna Manganara]]. Its current main UN representative in New York [[Soon-Young Yoon]] is also chair of the [[NGO Committee on the Status of Women, New York]] and First Vice-President of the [[Conference of NGOs]]. IAW's official working languages are English and French.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Millicent Fawcett.jpg|thumb|Co-founder and Vice President, Dame [[Millicent Fawcett]]]]\nThe decision for the establishment of the organization was taken in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1902 by suffragists frustrated at the reluctance of the [[International Council of Women]] to support women's suffrage.{{sfn|Liddington|1989|p=37}} The Alliance was formally constituted in [[Berlin]] in 1904 as the '''International Woman Suffrage Alliance''' (IWSA), and was headquartered in [[London]] for much of its history.{{sfn|Liddington|1989|p=56}} Amongst subsequent congresses were those held in [[Copenhagen]] (1906), [[Amsterdam]] (1908), [[London]] (1909), [[Stockholm]] (June 1911), and [[Budapest]] (1913).{{sfn|Liddington|1989|p=63}} The [[French Union for Women's Suffrage]] (UFSF), founded in February 1909. was formally recognized by the IWFA congress in London in April 1909 as representing the French suffrage movement.{{sfn|Hause|2002}} The IWSA also started its own monthly journal, the ''Jus Suffragii''. The IWSA, influenced by [[Millicent Fawcett]] against the militancy of suffragettes in the style of [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], initially refused membership to the [[WSPU]] at their 1906 Copenhagen meeting.{{sfn|Liddington|1989|p=63}}\n\nIn the late 1920s the organization changed its name to the ''International Alliance of Women for Suffrage and Equal Citizenship'', and in 1946 this was altered to its current name, ''International Alliance of Women''.<ref>[http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss330.html The International Alliance of Women Records, 1906-2004]</ref>{{sfn|Boles|Hoeveler|2004|p=21}}\nThe first Executive Board included [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] (President), [[Anita Augspurg]] (1st Vice President), [[Donovan Bolden]] (2nd Vice President) and [[Rachel Foster Avery]] (Secretary).\n\nThe organization's first President Carrie Chapman Catt also founded the [[League of Women Voters]] in the United States during her presidency.\n\nThe organization's traditional colour, used to symbolize women's rights and women's suffrage, is yellow.{{sfn|Lumsden|1997|p=162}}\n\n===Conferences===\n* [[First Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|1st]], Washington, D.C., 1902\n* [[Second Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|2nd]], Berlin, 1904\n* [[Third Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|3rd]], Copenhagen, 1906\n* [[Fourth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|4th]], Amsterdam, 1908\n* [[Fifth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|5th]], London, 1909\n* [[Sixth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|6th]], Stockholm, 1911\n* [[Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|7th]], Budapest, 1913\n* [[Eighth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|8th]], Geneva, 1920\n* 9th, Rome, 1923\n* 19th, Paris, 1926\n* 11th, Berlin, 1929\n* 12th, Istanbul, 1935\n* 13th, Copenhagen, 1939\n* 14th, Interlaken, 1946\n* 15th, Amsterdam, 1949\n* 16th, Naples, 1952\n* 17th, Colombo, Ceylon, 1955\n* 18th, Athens, 1958\n* 19th, Dublin, 1961\n* 20th\n* 21st, England, 1967\n* 22nd, Konigstein, West Germany, 1970\n* 23rd, New Delhi, 1973\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:Carrie Chapman Catt.jpg|thumb|The IAW's first President [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]]]\n[[File:Jus suffragii - earthenware plate - International Woman Suffrage Alliance - Atria, Institute on Gender Equality and Women's History , Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Plate with the symbol and motto of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA).

Research on Women (ICRW)''' is a [[non-profit]] organization headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]], with a regional office in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. ICRW has project offices in Mumbai and Hyderabad [[India]], and is establishing a formal presence in East Africa. ICRW works to promote [[gender equity|gender equitable]] development within the field of [[international development]].\n\n==Mission==\nAccording to the organization Web site:\n\n{{cquote|ICRW's mission is to empower women, advance gender equality and fight poverty in the developing world. To accomplish this, ICRW works with partners to conduct empirical research, build capacity and advocate for evidence-based, practical ways to change policies and programs.\n}}\n\n==Focus areas==\nICRW research identifies women's contributions to their communities and the barriers \u2013 like HIV, violence, and lack of education \u2013 that prevent them from being economically stable and able to fully participate in society. It focuses on three paths of action to achieve this:\n\n* Designing concrete, evidence-based plans for program designers, donors and policymakers that empower women to control their lives and help shape the future of their communities\n* Measuring changes in the lives of women and girls \u2013 as well as men and boys \u2013 to know how best to achieve gender equality\n* Recommending policy priorities that give women opportunities to transform their lives\n\nSome of its priorities include the economic empowerment of women, the prevention of HIV/[[AIDS]] among women and girls, the elimination of violence against women, the creation of better life options for women and girls, combating [[child marriage]], and increasing food security for vulnerable women.\n\nICRW is primarily a research institution whose strong quantitative and qualitative research contributes to the direct action of organizations and communities in which they work.\n\nICRW's tagline is, \"ICRW turns insight into action.\"\n\n==Leadership==\nThe board of directors of the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) announced June 14, 2010 that it has appointed social scientist [[Sarah Degnan Kambou]] president of the organization. Degnan Kambou served for two years as ICRW\u2019s chief operating officer (COO) under former president [[Geeta Rao Gupta]], and then as interim president and COO after Rao Gupta stepped down in April 2010.\n\nDegnan Kambou joined ICRW in 2002. As COO, she led the organization\u2019s research and programs, finance and human resources departments as well as ICRW\u2019s Asia Regional Office in New Delhi, India.

International Women\u2019s Development Agency is a secular, non-profit agency, founded in 1985 and based in [[Melbourne]]. IWDA undertakes projects in partnership with women from the Asia-Pacific region.

Wendy Poussard was the first Executive Director, while the other founders volunteered their time as members of the Committee of Management for over 5 years to establish IWDA.\n\nIWDA was formed \u201cbecause women were virtually invisible as planners and managers of development programs\u201d, as Wendy Poussard stated, and in recognition of the fact that women do less well than men as a group in every country.\n\nThe development projects that IWDA supports are devised and implemented by women who live and work in the communities themselves, helping to ensure relevance and effectiveness. As an organisation committed to women\u2019s human rights and women\u2019s political and economic empowerment, they seek to lead by example, showing how development is done better and outcomes improved when women are involved and the barriers to their participation are consciously identified and addressed.

These lay volunteers, brought into Alaska by Gleeson and Edmond, were the first recruits of what became the Jesuit Volunteer Corps.

Some of the women were confident, where as others used the society as a place where they could discuss a wide range of subjects privately.

(London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974), 6.</ref>  This petition was the first of its kind, but cleverly and specifically excluded married women, whose enfranchised husbands held their property and held the power to stifle the document.  The Kensington Society relied on social networks to obtain 1,499 signatures.<ref name=Dingsdale/> The Society petitioned [[Henry Fawcett]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], Parliament members who favored universal suffrage.  Mill added an amendment giving women equal political rights to the Reform Bill in 1866 and, with Fawcett, presented it to Parliament.  The legislature defeated the amendment with a 196 to 73 vote, but the Kensington Society persisted.\n\nFollowing this defeat, the society decided to try new tactics.  On 5 July 1867, it was renamed the '''London National Society for Women\u2019s Suffrage''' and formed a loose federation with a similar group based in Manchester and Edinburgh called the '''National Society for Women\u2019s Suffrage''' (NSWS).<ref> Andrew Rosen, ''Rise Up, Women!'' (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974), 7.</ref>  Eventually, 17 similar organizations allied and became the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) and were key to the ultimate success of the women's suffrage movement.\n\nThe Kensington Society facilitated discussion between progressive and driven women of 19th century London.  Their discussion and political actions served as the foundation for women's suffrage movements and catalyzed political action.  Several of its members continued advocating change to and beyond the point where English women exercised the right to vote.  Though only officially active from 1865 to 1868, the Kensington Society served a crucial role in the establishment of women\u2019s suffrage in the United Kingdom.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fawcett, Millicent Garrett.

It is a network of state [[domestic violence]] coalitions, representing over 2,000 member organizations nationwide. NNEDV works to address the many aspects of domestic violence. Kim Gandy has served as the President and CEO of the organization since 2012. Past presidents of NNEDV include Congresswoman [[Donna Edwards]], Sue Else (current CEO of [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] of Historic Georgia), and former White House Advisor on Violence Against Women Lynn Rosenthal.\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThe National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV), originally known as the Domestic Violence Coalition on Public Policy, was founded in 1990 by a group of domestic violence coalitions in order to promote federal legislation related to domestic violence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.readinessbeginswithme.org/pdf/NNEDV.pdf|title=Readiness Begins with Me|last=|first=|date=|website=Readiness Begins with Me|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Along with local, state, and national domestic violence coalitions, NNEDV led the efforts to pass the landmark [[Violence Against Women Act|Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)]], authored by then-Senator, [[Joe Biden]]. In 1995, after the passage of VAWA, DVCOPP became the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The VAWA implementation led to NNEDV\u2019s groundbreaking work on Transitional Housing.\n\n==Policy work==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThe National Network to End Domestic Violence performs legislative policy work with all three branches. NNEDV has been called to testify before the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] on domestic violence issues to assist state coalitions in better serving the needs of the victim by presenting research on domestic violence issues for pending legislation. NNEDV works proactively on Capitol Hill to make ending domestic violence a national priority. NNEDV\u2019s members are state and territorial coalitions representing domestic violence shelters and programs in every state and territory in the nation. They work closely with the state and territorial coalitions to understand the ongoing and emerging needs at the local and state level, and then ensure those needs are heard and understood by policymakers at the national level. Ensuring the funding of domestic violence programs remains a continued concern. NNEDV\u2019s policy efforts also focus on gun violence, the technology sector,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://techsafety.org/|title=TechSafety.org|website=Technology Safety|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref> and economic and financial security.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clicktoempower.org/financial-tools/curriculum-download|title=Curriculum Download|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref>\n\n===VAWA Implementation===\nNNEDV worked for the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s47/text|title=Text of S. 47 (113th): Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Passed Congress/Enrolled Bill version) - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|access-date=2016-07-25}}</ref> VAWA closed critical gaps in funding, ensuring all domestic violence survivors receive services. NNEDV  participated in the [[Office on Violence Against Women|OVW]] conferral process, sharing information about VAWA's impact on the field, gaps in the federal response, and challenges and successes of implementation. NNEDV also participated in stakeholder meetings about the implementation of VAWA's Campus SaVE provisions and worked to ensure that the negotiated rulemaking committee considered, in particular, the needs of student victims of dating abuse and stalking, as well as the confidentiality and safety needs of student victims. NNEDV also communicated the same messages to the White House Task Force on Campus Sexual Assault. Historically, VAWA was the first piece of federal legislation to specifically provide protections for members of the LGBT community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nnedv.org/policy/issues/vawa.html|title=National Network to End Domestic Violence {{!}} Violence Against Women Act|website=nnedv.org|access-date=2016-06-30}}</ref> Additionally, NNEDV continues to work to ensure that programs such as the [[Family Violence Prevention and Services Act]] (FVSPA) and [[Victims of Crime Act of 1984|Victims of Crime Act]] (VOCA) receive adequate funding.\n\n===Appropriations and funding===\nNNEDV leads the national Campaign for Funding to End Domestic and Sexual Violence. Through this work, NNEDV is at the forefront of advocating for increased funding and resources for local programs and state coalitions. As part of this advocacy, NNEDV coordinates and implements a strategic action plan that combines national level work with grasstops and grassroots mobilization around the federal budget. The primary focus of appropriations advocacy is on increasing funding under the Violence Against Women Act, the Family Violence Prevention Services Act, and the Victims of Crime Act.\n\n===Gun violence===\nNNEDV has emerged as one of the leading organizations for commonsense firearms legislation, specifically, an improved and expanded background checks system. The clear connection to this work - preventing domestic violence homicides - has helped to build momentum around such legislation. NNEDV advocates for closing loopholes in the background checks system and for needed improvements to data collection through NICS. NNEDV continues to work with Everytown for Gun Safety (formerly Mayors Against Illegal Guns), as well as with other national organizations, to provide critical information and targeted action alerts to the field around proposed legislation to address gun violence. Additionally, NNEDV hosted a webinar with coalitions on gun violence and conducted a thorough review of state-level domestic violence homicide data, as well as information about lethality assessment programs and fatality review teams in the states. NNEDV won a significant victory on this issue under the U.S. Supreme Court decision in U.S. v. Castleman, where the Court upheld a definition under the law that will continue to prohibit convicted domestic violence abusers from possessing firearms. NNEDV's amicus brief in the case, which outlined the importance of upholding this protection through a common-sense interpretation of the law, was referenced by the Court.\n\n== Amicus briefs ==\n\n=== Commonwealth v. Claybrook ===\nIn February 2013 NNEDV signed onto an amicus brief filed in the case Commonwealth v. Claybrook. This case involved the sexual assault of a college freshman by three men in her dorm room. A Pennsylvania jury convicted the men, and the trial court denied their motions for judgment of acquittal and/or a new trial on the charges. However, the Superior Court overturned these convictions. The advocates\u2019 amicus brief argued that the Superior Court's decision was based on misconceptions and myths about sexual assault, including the victim's supposed insufficient resistance, which was long ago removed as a requirement in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed the Superior Court and remanded the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/superior-court/2013/1926-eda-2010.html|title=Com. v.

Fair ===\nThis case involves the question of whether to remove a child from the custody of his mother and return the child to the custody of his father in Singapore, in a circumstance where the father had been physically and verbally abusive toward the mother, including in the presence of the child. The district court held that the child was not in \u201cgrave risk of harm\u201d in living with his father. The advocates amicus brief argued that this conclusion runs counter to the weight of evidence that children exposed to domestic violence are themselves at serious risk of harm and that both mother and child were continuously abused post-separation from the abuser (and that this abuse must be taken seriously).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/12-5088/12-5088-2013-06-13.html|title=Souratgar v.

The case asks whether or not this firing constitutes a separation from employment \u201cdue to domestic violence\u201d subject to unemployment compensation. This is the first case requiring interpretation of D.C. Code Section 51-131 in the District of Columbia; it is also the first case in the country on this subject to reach a court of appeals. The advocates amicus brief argues that her allowing her partner onto the worksite was not truly voluntary but was rather a product of the pattern of coercion and power exerted by her abuser and characteristic of domestic violence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2014cv01969/169151/18/|title=CROMEARTIE v.

This Census takes into account the dangerous nature of domestic violence by using a survey designed to protect the confidentiality and safety of victims. It also allows for a true representation of the gaps in services, and the strain it causes upon US domestic violence shelters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nnedv.org/resources/census.html|title=National Network to End Domestic Violence {{!}} Census: Domestic Violence Counts|website=nnedv.org|access-date=2016-06-30}}</ref> For example, the 10th annual census report conducted on September 16, 2015, had a 93% participation rate amongst identified local domestic violence in the United States and territories. The survey reported that during a 24-hour period on the census day, 71,828 victims were served. Among those victims, 40,302 victims found refuge in emergency shelters or transitional housing, and 31,526 adults and children received non-residential assistance and services, including counseling, legal advocacy, and children\u2019s support groups. However, the survey also reported that there were 12,197 unmet requests for services in one day, with 63% of the unmet need under the housing umbrella.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nnedv.org/projects/census/4655-domestic-violence-counts-census-2015-report.html|title=National Network to End Domestic Violence {{!}} Domestic Violence Counts: Census 2015 Report|website=nnedv.org|access-date=2016-06-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Coalition capacity project ===\nThe Coalition Capacity Project offers technical assistance for coalitions of groups working with survivors, such as organizational and leadership development.

The hearing focused upon pretexting and phone records. Southworth focused upon the necessity of keeping domestic violence survivor's information confidential. As Southworth said, \"All companies that collect and retain personal information about their customers should enhance the security and privacy options available to consumers, and create levels of security that are not easily breached from within or from outside of the company. Given the creative and persistent tactics of perpetrators, companies must work with consumers to identify the methods of security that will work best for general consumers, as well as methods for consumers in higher-risk situations, including victims of domestic violence and law enforcement officers.\" <ref>http://www.ncdsv.org/images/ProtectingConsumersPhoneRecords.pdf</ref> On June 4, 2014, Southworth, representing both NNEDV and the Minnesota Council for Battered Women, testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law. Southworth testified in support of Minn. Senator Al Franken's proposed legislation, The Location Privacy Protection Act of 2014. The bill seeks to ban these stalking apps and would require companies to inform consumers when their information is being used and what for what purpose.<ref>https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2171</ref> Southworth testified that these apps are not covert in their marketing. Calling attention to apps such as HelloSpy, Southworth showed screenshots from the website showing women in various domestic violence situations. In one picture, under the section advertising the importance of catching cheating spouses, a man stands holding a woman's arm tightly while her face shows clear abrasions. This is a pattern among the majority of these alleged spy applications. Southworth testified that \"consent is critical...and a reminder that the user's location is being tracked is critical.\" Southworth also provided additional recommendations on behalf of the organization and stood in firm support of the legislation.<ref>https://www.library.ca.gov/crb/rfidap/docs/SOUTHWORTHNNEDVRFIDandvictims.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Positively safe ===\nDeveloped in 2010, with a grant from the MAC AIDS Foundation, this special project addresses the intersection between HIV/AIDS and domestic violence. Together with the National Domestic Violence & HIV/AIDS Advisory Committee, NNEDV developed a curriculum to train service providers in both fields. The curriculum has a large focus on building collaboration to address the intersection and prevent HIV and domestic violence. In 2015 the Positively Safe project launched a toolkit for domestic violence and HIV/AIDS service providers, with resources on safety planning, linkage to retention in care, conversation guides, and more. The project will continue to expand the resources in the toolkit. In 2013, NNEDV was able to present its curriculum to the President\u2019s Working Group on the Intersection of HIV/AIDS, Violence against Women and Girls, and Gender-Related Health Disparities. Because of NNEDV's on-going commitment to these issues, the project was funded to provide training to select groups on the intersection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nnedv.org/projects/otherprojects/dv-hiv-aids.html|title=National Network to End Domestic Violence {{!}} Intersection of Domestic Violence & HIV/AIDS|website=nnedv.org|access-date=2016-06-30}}</ref>\n\n===WomensLaw===\nWomensLaw was founded in February 2000 by a group of lawyers, teachers, advocates and web designers interested in using the Internet to educate survivors of domestic violence about their legal rights and ways to get help.

Its basic principle is that full and equal enjoyment of [[human rights]] is due to all women and girls, and it works to advance women's social, economic and political situation in Norway as well as internationally. Historically associated with the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], the NKF is today [[Big tent|broadly representative]] of the political spectrum. The association has successfully campaigned for women\u2019s [[right to education]], the [[women's suffrage|right to vote]], the [[right to work]] and the establishment of what is now the [[Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud]], and currently focuses on the implementation of the [[CEDAW]] convention and women's human rights more broadly.\n\nThe current President is [[Marit Nybakk]], who is also First Vice-President of the Norwegian Parliament. The NKF is a member of the [[International Alliance of Women]] (IAW), which has [[general consultative status]] to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]]. The NKF is also a member of the [[Norwegian Women's Lobby]] and the [[Forum for Women and Development]]. Several of the NKF's early leaders, among them the noted humanitarian [[Fredrikke Marie Qvam]], were married to Norwegian prime ministers. Its postwar leaders include Liberal Party leader and cabinet minister [[Eva Kolstad]], supreme court justice [[Karin M. Bruzelius]] and the former chairman of UNICEF, [[Torild Skard]].

Historically, the NKF was the most important association of the Norwegian bourgeois (or liberal) women's movement (associated chiefly with the Liberal Party), in contrast to the labour women's movement (associated with the Labour Party). Today, it is a nonpartisan organisation, focusing on women's political, legal and human rights as well as equal opportunities, and on the implementation of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] in particular.\n\nThe NKF has co-operated with the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Norway)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]] and later with the [[Norwegian National Women's Council]]. Some of the prominent post-war leaders were [[Eva Kolstad]], who later became a cabinet minister, leader of the Liberal Party and the world's first Gender Equality Ombud, [[Karin M. Bruzelius]], who became a supreme court justice, and former UNICEF Chairman [[Torild Skard]].\n\nThe Norwegian Association for Women's Rights has been affiliated with the [[International Alliance of Women]] (IAW) since 1904 and is a member of the [[Norwegian Women's Lobby]] and the [[Forum for Women and Development]]. It addresses the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] through its IAW membership.\n\nThe organisation had its offices in ''Sehesteds gate'' 1 in Oslo for many years, and now has its offices in ''Majorstuveien'' 39 at [[Majorstuen]] in central Oslo.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Presidents==\n\n[[File:H\u00f8yesterettsdommer Karin Bruzelius.jpeg|thumb|[[Karin M.

Prominent journalistic, human rights and pro-democracy organizations have awarded important prizes, to both the organization and some of its members.\n\n== Origins==\nIranian [[women's rights]] activists in [[Iran]] started the Campaign, to follow up a peaceful protest with the same aim in 2006 in Haft-e Tir Square in [[Tehran]]. Preparation started immediately in June, and the campaign was officially launched on August 28, at a seminar entitled ''The Impact of Laws on Women\u2019s Lives''.\n\n== Goals ==\nAs well as collecting a million signatures to support reform of the law, the Campaign, in its own words, also aims to achieve the following:\n\n# Promotion of [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]] for social change.\n# Identification of women\u2019s needs and priorities.\n# Amplifying women\u2019s voices.\n# Increasing knowledge, promoting democratic action.\n# Paying our dues.\n# The Power of numbers.\n# Power in [[Multiculturalism|diversity]].\n\nThe campaign seeks to secure equal rights in marriage and inheritance, an end to polygamy, and stricter punishments for honour killings and other forms of violence.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2008/09/women-rights-iran-blogs-online \"Battle of the blogs\" by Asieh Amini, Published 11 September 2008]</ref> \n\nThe organizers of  the campaign consider that its demands conform to [[Islamic]] principles, and are in line with Iran\u2019s international commitments. As a signatory to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] Iran has committed to eliminate all forms of discrimination, and needs to take specific action in reforming laws that promote [[discrimination]]. These demands are in no way contradictory to the foundations of Islam, and have been discussed among Islamic jurists and scholars for some time. \n\nThe organizers hope that a million-signature petition will demonstrate, to decision-makers and the general public, that the desire to change discriminatory laws against women is not limited to a small segment of society, but widespread among diverse parts of the Iranian population.\n\n==Strategy==\nSimilar signature campaigns have been held in other countries. Specifically, women in [[Morocco]] held a \"One Million Signature\" campaign for women's rights in 1992.<ref>Zakia Salime, Between Feminism and Islam: Human Rights and Sharia Law in Morocco (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2011): 32-34.</ref> The ''Million Signatures'' campaign was initiated solely by Iranian women in Iran without any support from any foreign countries. However, it has been active in collecting signatures both from Iranian citizens who live in Iran, and from those who are residents of other countries.\n\nThe campaign has been described as a way to take advantage of the \"figurative walls\" of privacy in Iran.<ref>Majd, Hooman, ''The Ayatollah Begs to Differ : The Paradox of Modern Iran'', by Hooman Majd, Doubleday, 2008, p.188</ref> A political demonstration may find little publicity and its participants may be beaten and arrested \u2014 as happened at the 12 June 2006 demonstration. However, signature seekers \"fan out in ones and twos, to small towns and villages, going into shops, beauty salons, schools and offices, or stand at bus stops explaining 'face to face' how the Iranian interpretation of Sharia law is stacked against half the population. They ask men and women to sign their petition.\"<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/lipstick-revolution-irans-women-are-taking-on-the-mullahs-1632257.html Lipstick revolution: Iran's women are taking on the mullahs, by Katherine Butler, 26 Feb 2009]</ref>\n\n== Successes ==\n=== Olof Palme Prize 2008 ===\n\nJournalist and activist [[Parvin Ardalan]] should have been in Stockholm on March 6, 2008.

The organization then moved parts of its work out of Afghanistan into Pakistan and established their main base there to work for Afghan women.\n\n==Founder==\n[[Image:Meena founder of RAWA speaking in 1982.jpg|thumb|[[Meena Keshwar Kamal|Meena]] (1956 - 1987), founder of RAWA]]\n\nRAWA was founded by a group of Afghan women led by [[Meena Keshwar Kamal]].<ref name=\"Toynbee\"/> At age 21, she laid the foundations of RAWA through her work educating women. In 1979, Kamal began a campaign against [[Soviet forces]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Soviet-supported government of Afghanistan]]. In 1981, she launched a [[bilingual]] magazine called Payam-e-Zan ([[Women\u2019s Message]]). In the same year, she visited [[France]] for the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party Congress]]. She also established schools for [[Afghan refugees|Afghan refugee]] children, hospitals and handicraft centers for refugee women in Pakistan. Her activities and views, as well as her work against the government and religious fundamentalists led to her [[assassination]] on February 4, 1987.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1973184.stm |title=Afghan activist's killers hanged |first=Susannah |last=Price |date=7 May 2002 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Early activities==\n[[Image:RAWA protest rally against Taliban in Peshawar April28-1998.jpg|thumb|left|A protest of RAWA in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan on April 28, 1998]]\n\nMuch of RAWA's efforts in the 1990s involved holding seminars and press conferences and other fund-raising activities in Pakistan. RAWA also created [[secret school]]s, [[orphanage]]s, [[nursing]] courses, and [[handicraft]] centers for women and girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They secretly filmed women being beaten in the street in Afghanistan by the [[Mutaween|religious police]], and being executed. RAWA activities were forbidden by both the [[Taliban]] and the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]], but they persisted, and even publicised their work in publications like [[Payam-e-Zan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/28against.htm |title=The Taliban show their fangs to RAWA |work=Excerpts from Wahdat daily, published in Peshawar (April 30, 1998) |publisher=RAWA |accessdate=7 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==RAWA after the 2001 invasion==\nRAWA is highly critical of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|NATO war]] that began in 2001, because of the high rate of casualties among the civilian population. The organization went so far as to threaten to sue [[United States government]] for unauthorized use of four photos from their website that were used in [[propaganda]] handbills dropped on various cities in Afghanistan during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 invasion]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/us_flyer.htm |title=RAWA to sue US authorities - Bureau Report  |publisher=RAWA |accessdate=7 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[Taliban]] government by US and [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] forces, RAWA warned that the Northern Alliance were just as [[fundamentalist]] and dangerous as the Taliban. They charge that the government led by President [[Hamid Karzai]] lacked support in most areas of Afghanistan, and that fundamentalists are enforcing laws unfairly treating women as they were under the Taliban. These claims are supported by media reports about the [[Herat]] government of [[Ismail Khan]], who has created a [[Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Afghanistan)|religious police]] that forces women to obey strict dress and behavior codes, as well as many reports by [[Human Rights Watch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/doc?t=asia&c=afghan |title=Human Rights Watch homepage |accessdate=7 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews |title=RAWA news homepage |accessdate=7 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOne recent report <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17533816 |title=Hundreds of Afghan women jailed for 'moral crimes'  |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 March 2012 |date=28 March 2012}}</ref>  released by Human Rights Watch in 2012 describes a situation where women are punished by the judicial system for attempting to escape from domestic abuse and also occasionally for being victims of rape. It says that Karzai is \"[u]nwilling or unable to take a consistent line against conservative forces within the country,\" and that the lack of improvement in the plight of women in Afghanistan after ten years is \"shocking.\"\n\n==Recent activities==\nRAWA collects funds to support hospitals, schools and orphanages and still run many projects in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including a project in conjunction with CharityHelp.org for orphan sponsorships.\n\nRecently RAWA restarted its mission inside Afghanistan and organized some of its events in Kabul. They've held events annually on [[International Women's Day]] since 2006.\n\nOn September 27, 2006, a RAWA member for the first time (perhaps in the whole history of RAWA) appeared on a round table debate on a local [[Afghan TV]] channel, [[TOLO TV]]. She had a debate with a representative of a hard line [[Islamic fundamentalist]] group. She named the top leaders of the [[Islamist]] groups and termed them \"war criminal and responsible for the ongoing tragedy in Afghanistan\". Tolo TV censored the audio of any sections where names were called.\n\nOn October 7, the [[Afghan Women's Mission]] (AWM) organized a fund raising event for RAWA in [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afghanwomensmission.org/awmnews/index.php?articleID=62 |title=The Afghan Women's Mission |publisher=- AWM News }}</ref> [[Eve Ensler]] was the chief guest and [[Sonali Kolhatkar]] and Zoya, a member of RAWA, were among the speakers. \"Zoya\" is a pseudonym for an active member of RAWA's Foreign Committee who has traveled to many countries, including the U.S. and Spain as well as Germany. In 2003, she received international acclaim for her biography ''Zoya\u2019s Story - An Afghan Woman\u2019s Battle for Freedom.''\n\nIn June 2008 Zoya testified to the Human Rights Commission of the [[Bundestag|German Parliament (Bundestag)]] to persuade the German government to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2009, RAWA and other women's rights groups strongly condemned a \"Shia Family Code\" which is claimed to legalise spousal [[rape]] within Northern Afghan [[Shia]] Muslim communities, as well as endorsing [[child marriage]], [[purdah]] (seclusion) for married women, which was passed by President [[Hamid Karzai]] to garner support for his coalition government from hardline elements within the aforesaid communities, as well as the neighbouring Shia-dominated [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. In addition to the above, the new \"Family Code\" also enshrines discriminatory legal status in the context of inheritance and divorce against women.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/afghan-leader-accused-of-bid-to-legalise-rape-1658049.html |title=Afghan leader accused of bid to 'legalise rape'.

The effort brings together a wide range of organizations, including civic, social, civil rights and professional organizations, as well as those in government, education and media. While many AAALI partners have longstanding commitments to fighting HIV in their communities, the initiative provides the critical funding needed to allow each group to make HIV prevention a core component of its day-to-day activities. Each organization uses AAALI funds to support an HIV coordinator who works through the organization's membership networks to disseminate Act Against AIDS campaign materials and HIV prevention services. AAALI is a key component of Act Against AIDS (AAA) \u2013 CDC's five-year, $45 million campaign to re-engage every American in the fight against HIV by combating complacency, increasing testing, and raising awareness among communities at risk.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Project Reassurance===\n\nThe care and protection of children is, first and foremost, a family concern.

The sorority focuses on five principles - academics, community service, cultural awareness, social interaction, and morals and ethics - to unite their members as \"hermanas por vida\" (sisters for life).\n\nSince its beginnings, Sigma Lambda Gamma has created national national progonal programmings to empower their members and women of the community, such as the Young Women\u2019s Leadership Program and [[Emotional Intelligence]].  They have also partnered up with other organizations to improve political, educational, and social conditions in the United States.  A sisterhood of over 8,000 members, the sorority believes that ''Culture is Pride, Pride is Success'' and explores the richness in the traditions of different cultures. This encompasses the cultural heritages of Native Americans (North, Central and South), Africans, Europeans, Asians and their multiple and interesting mixtures.

With its beginnings at the University of Iowa, the vision was to create a network of academic and social support. Although the first meeting had 19 women, membership fluctuated during the planning process.<ref name=\"Alpha Chapter History\">{{cite web| title = Alpha Chapter History | author = | publisher = | date =  |url =http://www.uiowa.edu/~slgalpha/about.html | accessdate = 2013-06-04}}</ref>  Under the guidance of Esther Materon Arum and Mary Peterson, the members continued to draft a sorority that would be inclusive and empowering to women.  A retreat was held to establish the constitution and the purpose of the organization.  They also participated in volunteer projects such as the National Association of Chicano Studies (NACS), as well as on-campus programs such as the Leadership Conference.\n\nEventually, only five women remained. These women are Gloria Cuevas, Julieta Maria Miller, Maria Ester Pineda, Danell Marie Riojas, and Guadalupe Temiquel.

The goal of the program is to get a head start with young girls to provide them the self-awareness and self-esteem to help them finish their high school education and consider pursuing a college degree upon graduation.

(\u0398N\u039e)''' is a historically multicultural [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|sorority]] founded on April 11, 1997, at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], by seven women who sought to bridge cultural gaps. Theta Nu Xi was incorporated on April 29, 1999.\n\nIn 2001, Theta Nu Xi launched a functional Graduate, Alumnae and Professional (GAP) Program, the first of its kind among multicultural sororities. Theta Nu Xi continues to be the only multicultural sorority with a functional program to initiate and serve professional women beyond the collegiate years.\n\n==History<ref>http://www.thetanuxi.org/history.php</ref>==\nTheta Nu Xi was founded during a time when cultural Greek organizations began to proliferate on campuses across the United States. Theta Nu Xi was the first multicultural sorority founded in the [[Southeastern United States]]. The sorority has since grown to over fifty chapters and colonies in its thirteen years of existence.\n\nIn the spring of 1996, Melissa Jo Murchison-Blake sought a sisterhood that openly embraced all women and crossed cultural boundaries. As a bi-racial woman, she did not want to choose between historically Caucasian or African-American sororities. Murchison-Blake felt that if she did choose one, she would be denying half of her heritage.\n\nMurchison-Blake recruited six other women who would become the national founders of Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority. In the early days of its existence, the sorority met resistance from its campus of founding.  The Director of Greek Affairs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill advised the national founders to consider joining an existing organization, expressing his concern that a new Greek organization based on the principle of multiculturalism, would not survive at UNC. Despite such resistance, the national founders' continued efforts set the stage for Theta Nu Xi's presence in the Greek, non-Greek, and surrounding communities.\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill officially recognized Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority as the Alpha Chapter on April 11, 1997. To commemorate the end result of their perseverance, the national founders - now known as the Founding Monarchs - acknowledged April 11, 1997 as the official founding date of the organization. With the collaborative efforts of the Founding Monarchs and the initiates of Spring 1998, the organization grew exponentially.\n\nThe earliest members of Theta Nu Xi addressed an immediate need to develop an official process of expansion which would support new entities as well as serving the interests of the sorority. Under the visionary guidance of Anna Lamadrid, two new chapters of the sorority were founded in the spring of 1999 - one at [[North Carolina State University]] and one at [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro|UNC Greensboro]]. The three groups of women designated themselves Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, respectively, and thus the national organization was born.\n\nThe Sorority incorporated on April 29, 1999 and with the participation of the Alpha Chapter and Beta and Gamma Colonies, the National Organization was established at the first annual National Convention on August 21, 1999.  The first out-of-state expansion effort resulted in the founding of a chapter Utah State University in the spring of 2000.\n\n===Graduate, Alumnae, and Professional (GAP) Program<ref>http://www.thetanuxi.org/history.php</ref>===\nIn the first national constitution, the earliest members of Theta Nu Xi had laid the foundation for an active post-graduate status. On July 19, 2000, 16 women petitioned the National Board to be granted status as an Alumnae Chapter.  These women requested that a structure be put in place that would allow post-collegiate members the ability to participate fully in Sorority activities and the National Organization while a more complete structure was being developed.  The National Board granted the 16 pioneers the equivalent of chapter status, allowing them to send representatives to the 2000 National Convention.\n\nAt this Convention, on behalf of the Alumnae Chapter, Soror Jerri Kallam submitted a resolution to establish Alumnae Chapter Standards.  During the same meeting, Soror Amanda Greene, representing the Alpha Chapter, submitted a resolution to create a committee to examine the role of alumnae and professional membership.  These resolutions were adopted and a committee was created.  This committee, composed of Sorors Jerri Kallam, Christie Aden, Shannon Stewart and Melissa Murchison-Blake, was charged with refining and further developing the name, structure and important documents relating to alumnae and professional membership and so sparked the development of an official Graduate, Alumnae and Professional Program.\n\nAt the 2001 National Convention, the alumnae committee submitted a GAP policy along with supporting documents.  Through the advocacy of this committee and the success of the program as evidenced by the GAP-initiated women present at Convention, the GAP Program was officially established and became the first of its kind for multicultural sororities.  Founding Monarchs Melissa Murchison-Blake and Janelle Poe, along with Sorors Holly Woodard and Rebecca Treherne, officially chartered the first GAP Chapter on April 11, 2002.\n\nBeing the first multicultural sorority to offer an established Graduate, Alumnae and Professional Program, Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority, Inc. began receiving numerous inquiries from interested women.  As more women were initiated at this level, and as undergraduate members graduated, the GAP program became a crucial component of the Sorority's structure.\n\nGAP women now serve on the National Board, support the undergraduate sisterhood as advisors, and participate in all aspects of Sorority operations including expansion teams, national committees, ONEVision - the official Sorority newsletter, and more.\n\n===National Founders<ref>http://www.thetanuxi.org/history.php</ref>===\n*Geeta Nadia Kapur\n*Natalie Nicole Barker\n*Peggy Virginia Long\n*Melissa Jo Murchison-Blake\n*Brenda Imade Eribo\n*Katherine Ellen Stanley\n*Janelle Kalia Poe\n\n===Values<ref>http://www.thetanuxi.org/values.php</ref>===\nThe mission of Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority, Inc. is to promote leadership, multiculturalism, and self-improvement through academic excellence, involvement in and service to the [[campus]] and community, as well as being living examples of sisterhood across different races, cultures, religions, backgrounds, and lifestyles.\n\nThe tenets of the Sorority are Scholarship, Service, [[Fraternities and sororities|Sisterhood]], [[Leadership]], and [[Multiculturalism]].\n\nThe motto of the Sorority is \"Sisters of Diversity, Together as ONE\".\n\nThe objectives of the sorority are to incorporate separate cultures into one life, to build self-esteem through sisterhood, to participate in service activities, especially those concerning diversity in the community, to encourage academic excellence and overall self-improvement,and to promote unity among Greek organizations.\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Regions<ref>http://www.thetanuxi.org/nbcontact.php</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The four agencies joined efforts to effectively communicate the truth about men's violence against women. Ben Atherton-Zeman created the comical one-man performance which was the inspiration for the group. He performed locally for over 600 students and about 130 other people in the community. After much success of his performances and a fall event called \"Men's Summit,\" Fox Valley Voices of Men was formed to keep the effort of ending violence against women going.\"<ref name=\"Article\">[http://www.voicesofmen.com/ Voices of Men Website]</ref>\n\nThe mission statement of the group is \"Voices of Men is a group of Fox Valley men dedicated to ending violence in our community and preventing the abuse of girls and women through education, role modeling and mentoring of boys and men.\"<ref name=\"Article\"/> The philosophy of this group is about preventing violence and abuse by being part of the solution, not the problem.

Wilson]]. It was headquartered in New York City and has regional offices in Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, and Georgia. The organization closed in 2013 due to difficult economic times.<ref>{{cite web|last=Franke-Ruta|first=Garance|title=The White House Project Shutters Its Doors|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/01/the-white-house-project-shutters-its-doors/272576/|publisher=''The Atlantic''|format=Web|date=January 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Vote, Run, Lead==\n\nVote, Run, Lead was a program of The White House Project designed to engage women in the political process as voters, activists, and candidates through training, inspiration, and networking. The training, which included communications, fundraising, and campaigning, aimed to demystify the political process and inspire women to be leaders. The White House Project offered a variety of ways for women to get involved with the program through voter education and registration, community forums and events, political leadership trainings, issue briefings, networking events, and movie screenings.\n\nSeveral day-long training \"boot camps\" gave women in-depth knowledge on specific areas. Debate Boot Camp helped women expertly discuss and defend issues. Security Boot Camp taught material related to National Security. Fund raising Boot Camp helped women create financial plans. Strategy Boot Camp prepared women to contact voters and have a field plan.\n\n==Corporate Council==\n\nFounded in 2006, The White House Project\u2019s Corporate Council's purpose was to engage senior businesswomen with government policy issues, private philanthropy, academia, and business, and to facilitate engagement between senior businesswomen in the private and public sectors. Members of the Council were corporate women who were active agents of change within their corporations, and who occupied, or had access to, their executive suite.\n\nIn November 2009, TWHP's Corporate Council released Benchmarking Women's Leadership: A Report Card on the Leadership Gap in America. This report was commissioned by the Council to document and highlight the relative lack of women in senior leadership roles across a number of sectors. Throughout the year, Council members participated in series of meetings focused on leadership development, and dialogue with senior members of the media, politicians and activists about a range of timely and engaging topics.  Corporate Council Members included Bank of America, Barbie, Best Buy, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and HBO.\n\n==The White House Project Report: Benchmarking Women's Leadership==\n\nBenchmarking Women's Leadership examined ten sectors across American culture (politics, business, law, sports, academia, journalism, religion, film/TV, nonprofit, and military) and offered possible solutions from experts in each sector on how to advance women's leadership to get to a critical mass.\n\n==Barbie's candidacy endorsement==\nOn Thursday 5 April, Dufu and The White House Project honored leading women at the 10th anniversary of the EPIC (Enhancing Perception in Culture) Awards, where Barbie made her big announcement and unveiled a new Tumblr page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/fashion/barbie-running-president-doll-pink-power-suit-designed-chris-benz-article-1.1056407?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Barbie running for President!

In an effort to help women business owners and promote available government resources, then-Governor [[George Deukmejian]] took action to create a conference focused on helping women gain access to financial, professional, and personal support. The Governor selected his hometown of Long Beach to host the first conference on September 23-24th, 1985. It was a huge success with over 2,000 members in attendance. \n\nAfter its inauguration, [[Gloria Saatjian|Gloria Deukmejian]] soon assumed responsibility for the conference, which became known as the California Governor and First Lady\u2019s Conference. Since then, the Governor of California and his wife, the California First Lady, have traditionally played a key role in the support and promotion of the highly acclaimed event. \n\nIn 1989, the conference was established as a nonprofit public interest organization with a bi-partisan Board of Directors\u2014an organizational move meant to ensure that changes in the Governor\u2019s Mansion would not affect the continuity of the conference.\nWith each successive California administration, the size and scope of the event has expanded considerably.  Under First Lady [[Gayle Wilson]]\u2019s chairmanship the conference expanded its focus to include corporate women and under First Lady [[Sharon Davis]]\u2019s direction, the conference added a youth leadership program.  \n\nFor over 25 years, the conference steadily became better-known. Its popularity increased significantly after the 2007 election of [[actor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Governor of California with the support of his wife, Maria Shriver. At her direction, it was renamed The Women\u2019s Conference and the event attracted an extensive roster of high-profile speakers and celebrities. In 2010, the conference was attended by more than 30,000 over three days of events, a record for the conference\u2019s 27-year-old history. \n\nIn addition, the event earned at least [[US$]]5 million to $6 million in revenues for the City Convention Center, local hotels, restaurants and other businesses.  \n\n==From 2010==\nAfter the Conference\u2019s significant success from 2007, all gubernatorial support of the conference was withdrawn on the accession of [[Jerry Brown]], Jr. as governor of California in 2010, due to the state\u2019s budget crisis. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2011/02/03/future-of-annual-womens-conference-uncertain/ |title=Future of Annual Women's Conference Uncertain |publisher=CBS Los Angeles |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref>   Accordingly, the California Governor and First Lady\u2019s Conference on Women was dissolved, and in 2011 there was no California Women\u2019s Conference.\n\nIt was planned for the city of Long Beach to host the 2012 conference  on September 23 and 24, 2012, at the Long Beach Convention Center, under the name California Women's Conference, with the theme \u201cThe Future is Now\u201d, building upon the conference\u2019s 25-year legacy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://californiawomensconference.com/ |title=California Women's Conference |publisher=EventComplete |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref>\n\n==Event highlights==\nThe Women's Conference 2007 sold out in less than three days, a conference record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstelegram.com/business/ci_6436335 |title=In Basket |publisher=Press-Telegram |date= |accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> The conference gathered nearly 14,000 participants on Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2007, and featured a panel discussion moderated by Shriver of five presidential candidates' spouses, [[Jeri Thompson]], [[Michelle Obama]], [[Cindy Hensley McCain]], [[Elizabeth Edwards]] and [[Ann Romney]].<ref>Wives of Candidates Debate Their Roles, http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=3764553</ref> [[Bill Clinton]] did not attend because of a scheduling conflict,<ref>'08 Wives Talk Candidly About Their Roles, http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/10/23/08-wives-talk-candidly-about-their-roles/</ref> though Shriver joked that he had been \"invited to serve coffee\".<ref>Wives of Candidates Compare Notes from Trail, New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/us/politics/24spouses.html</ref> The conversation touched on the role of the spouses in the campaign, the public's perceptions of the spouses, preparing their families for and protecting them from the campaign.<ref>Maria Shriver Moderates Panel of Five Wives of Presidential Candidates, USA Today On Politics Blog, http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2007/10/five-would-be-f.html</ref> Jon Stewart lampooned the first-ever \"wives debate\" on the October 30 edition of Comedy Central's The Daily Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=127610&title=wives-debate |title=Wives Debate |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2007, ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Thomas Friedman]] moderated a conversation on leadership and the environment between former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

The organization's president is [[Mahnaz Afkhami]].\n\nWLP's primary objective is to increase the number of women taking on leadership and [[decision-making]] roles at family, community, and national levels, and to improve the effectiveness of [[feminist]] [[social movements]] in Muslim-majority societies and globally by strengthening the capacity of our partner organizations.\n\n==Background==\nSince its founding WLP has established a partnership model that allows for a [[geometric]] increase in the human and material resources available to partner organizations, maximum use of shared learning across regions, and increased impact of collective [[social network|networking]] and solidarity capabilities. The Partnership is based on a relationship of intense and continuous [[communication]] and ongoing [[cooperation]] in the conception, development, implementation, monitoring, and [[evaluation]] of joint programs. WLP is an international, non-governmental organization (NGO) in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC).\n\n==Mission==\nWLP's mission is to advance [[communication]] and [[cooperation]] among and between the women of the world in order to protect human rights, facilitate sustainable development, and promote peace. WLP links those with access to resources, knowledge, and technologies to those without, and augments the voices and visions of the world's resource-poor majority. WLP believes that dialogue across boundaries of culture, class, gender, generation, and nation is essential for achieving socially equitable and environmentally sound development. To secure a healthy, safe, and democratic environment for all, WLP works to advance gender equity, involve men and boys in promoting gender parity, and facilitate the exchange of grassroots strategies within and across different cultures. By instituting a viable knowledge and learning framework, WLP's programs provide women and girls of the Global South with the technical knowledge and practical skills needed to participate in the global [[dialogue]] about rights, development, and peace.\n\n==Partnership==\nWomen's Learning Partnership is made up of WLP International in the USA and 20 autonomous and independent partner organizations based in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine, Turkey, and Zimbabwe.\n\n==Programs==\n* '''Leadership and Empowerment program''' promotes a model of participatory leadership and supports women to take on leadership roles in their families, communities, and societies.\n* '''Organizational Capacity Building program''' strengthens our partner organizations and their affiliates, contributing to the growth of a dynamic international women's movement.\n* '''ICT Capacity Building program''' supports individuals and organizations to develop vital ICT skills, which can be used for collective mobilization for gender equality and social justice.\n* '''Women's Human Rights program''' raises awareness of urgent women's human rights challenges and campaigns for legal reforms to improve women's status in Muslim-majority societies.\n* '''Culture of Peace program''' cultivates tolerance, pluralism, and cooperation through South-South and South-North dialogue.\n\n==Other activities==\nWLP currently serves as the Secretariat for the [http://www.iwdn.learningpartnership.org/ International Women's Democracy Network (IWDN)], a functional network of the World Movement for Democracy. The vision of the International Women\u2019s Democracy Network is to build a network of solidarity among women and women\u2019s organizations engaged in democracy activism. The Network will strengthen links among members by developing a virtual resource center and a forum for exchange of information and knowledge.\n\n==Management and administration==\nWLP\u2019s '''Board of Directors''' is made up of a diverse group of leading academics and NGO directors:\n* [[Mahnaz Afkhami]], founder and President, Women\u2019s Learning Partnership (Iran/USA)\n* [[Leila Ahmed]], Professor of Women\u2019s Studies in Religion, Harvard Divinity School (Egypt/USA)\n* [[Abena Busia]], Professor and Chair of the Department of Women's and Gender Studies, Rutgers University (USA)\n* [[Marian Wright Edelman]], founder and President, Children\u2019s Defense Fund (USA)(Board Emeritus)\n* Yakin Ert\u00fcrk, Council of Europe, Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) (Turkey)\n* Barbara Y.
