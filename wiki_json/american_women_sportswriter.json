She has covered almost all major events in [[ice hockey]], including every [[Stanley Cup Final]]s since {{scfy|1980}}, the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" defeat of the [[Soviet Union]] national team by the U.S. team in the [[1980 Winter Olympics]], and the growth of hockey on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] fueled by [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s arrival to the [[Los Angeles Kings]].\n\nShe is married to author Dennis D'Agostino, a former publicist with the [[New York Mets]] and [[New York Knicks|Knicks]].\n\nIn 2006, after many years of covering hockey and Olympic sports, she became a general sports columnist.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/ind05prolog.htm|title=2005 Induction Showcase|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=November 7, 2005}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elliott, Helene}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportswriters from California]]\n[[Category:Hockey Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:Elmer Ferguson Award winners]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:American women sportswriters]]\n\n\n{{US-sportswriter-stub}}\n[[Category:American sportswriters]]"}]},"14610450":{"pageid":14610450,"ns":0,"title":"Mary Garber","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"'''Mary Ellen Garber''' (April 19, 1916 \u2013 September 21, 2008) was an [[United States|American]] [[Sports journalism|sportswriter]], who was a pioneer among [[Women in journalism and media professions|women sportswriters]]. She received over 40 writing awards and numerous honors in a sports-writing career that spanned seven decades, the most prestigious of which was the 2005 Associated Press Sports Editors (APSE) [[Red Smith Award]]. Garber, the first woman to win the APSE award, also became the first woman to be inducted into the U.S. Basketball Writers Hall of Fame in 2002.<ref>[http://www.wssportsmenclub.org/sportsmen_club_035.htm Winston-Salem Sportsmen's Club]</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n\nShe was born in [[New York City]] in 1916, but relocated to [[Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]], with her family in 1924. At the age of eight, she had two passions: journalism and sports. She not only read the sports page, she played football\u2014tackle football\u2014for the Buena Vista Devils. As she matured, her five-foot, ninety-pound frame limited her to [[softball]] and [[tennis]], but her love of sports never slackened. While other girls swooned over movie stars, Garber, a huge [[Knute Rockne]] fan, wrote letters to [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] football players.<ref>[http://wpcf.org/oralhistory/garb.html ''Women in Journalism''], The Washington Press Club Foundation Oral History Project.</ref>\n\nGarber graduated from [[Hollins College]] in [[Virginia]], in 1938, with one goal: to become a newspaper reporter. In an interview with local historian Frank Tursi, Garber said, ''\"I never considered anything else. But never at any time did I think about being a sportswriter\"''.<ref>Tursi, Frank V. ''Winston-Salem Journal: Magnolia Trees and Pulitzer Prizes''. p. 98-100.</ref>\n\nIn 1940, the aspiring reporter entered journalism as the society editor at the ''[[Twin City Sentinel]]''. America's entry into [[World War II]] created a vacuum in the newspaper that enabled her to become a general assignment reporting. Later in 1944, when the high school sports stringer at the paper graduated and enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]], Garber filled his slot. At the end of the war, she moved back to general assignment reporting but not for long. After a year of dogging sports editor Carlton Bryd for sports assignments, both Bryd and managing editor, Nady Cates, agreed: Garber belonged on the sports beat.\n\nIn 1946, Garber joined the sports department and never left. Two things distinguished her career. For 30 years, she was the only female sportswriter in the Winston-Salem ([[ACC Conference]]) region and one of the few in the country. Also, when she entered sports journalism in 1946, she started covering the two black high schools in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County region, [[Atkins High School (North Carolina)|Atkins High School]] and [[Carver High School (Winston-Salem, North Carolina)|Carver High School]].<ref>[http://winstonsalem.nc.schoolwebpages.com/education/school/school.php?sectionid=131&sc_id=1180106164 Carver High School - Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nShe also covered [[Winston-Salem State University]], a black university. Her appearance at those schools launched her as an advocate for black athletes and coaches in the segregated region. Prior to her, both Winston-Salem papers, the ''Twin Cities Sentinel'' and the ''Winston-Salem Journal'', used school correspondents to call in game results.<ref name=AWSM>[http://www.awsmonline.org/pioneer_about.html The Association of Women in Sports Media]</ref>\n\nAs a woman, Garber was not allowed into team locker rooms and so had to wait outside the door, hoping to get quotes from coaches and players. At North Carolina State games, a security guard named John Baker (Raleigh NC police officer) hauled athletes out of the lockers to make sure she got her quotes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/03/sports/03vecsey.html?em&ex=1210046400&en=adbf7bf4c186feef&ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | title=An Overdue Honor for a Pioneer Sportswriter | first=George | last=Vecsey | date=May 3, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhen the ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'' acquired the ''Sentinel'' in the 1980s, Garber moved with it. She retired from the ''Journal'' in 1986, but continued working part-time until 2002. In 2006, the Association of Women in Sports Media (AWSM) renamed its ''Pioneer Award'' the ''Mary Garber Pioneer Award''.<ref name=AWSM />\n\nIn 1998, Garber received the [[Mel Greenberg Media Award]].<ref name=\"Mel Greenberg Media Award\">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Mel Greenberg Media Award|url=http://www.wbca.org/pages/AWARDS_mel-greenberg|work=|publisher=Women's Basketball Coaches Association|accessdate=2 Jul 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008, Garber was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the [[National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association]].<ref name=\"vecsey2008\">Vecsey, George (May 3, 2008).
