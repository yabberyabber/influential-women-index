Mary's husband Sir Henry Killigrew, a former pirate himself, was made a Vice-Admiral by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and tasked with suppressing piracy. Whenever her husband went to sea Mary engaged in piracy using the staff of her castle (Arwenack Castle in Cornwall) as crew and possibly with the Queen's knowledge. In 1570 she captured a German merchant ship off [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and her crew sailed it to Ireland to sell. However, the owner of this ship was a friend of Queen Elizabeth who then had Lady Mary arrested and brought to trial at the Launceston assizes. Some sources say she was sentenced to death and then pardoned by the Queen but this is due to confusion with another family member. According to sources, her family either bribed the jurors and she was acquitted or Queen Elizabeth arranged a short jail sentence. Whatever transpired, she gave up pirating and took up fencing stolen goods until she died several years later.<ref>[http://pages.prodigy.net/rodney.broome/pirfalmkilligrew.htm The Killigrews of Falmouth]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| '''[[Elizabeth Trewinnard|Lady Elizabeth Killigrew]]''' \n| \n| 1570s-1582\n| English\n| Elizabeth and her husband Sir John lived in [[Pendennis Castle]] in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth Harbour]].

Lady Elizabeth led an attack on the ship and then fenced the proceeds. Lady Elizabeth was later arrested and sentenced to death but pardoned. Her husband Sir John was ordered by the Privy Council to restore the vessel and goods to their owners but went into hiding along with the ship which resulted in several warrants for his arrest being issued for acts of piracy committed over the next eight years.<ref>[http://www.st-keverne.com/history/Diggens/d9.html Sea Borne Raiders of Cornwall] St Keverne Local Historical Society</ref>\n|}\n\n==17th-century pirates==\n\n{|  class=wikitable  \n!  width=\"21%\" | Name\n!  width=\"7%\" | Life\n!  width=\"7%\" | Years Active\n!  width=\"10%\" | Country of origin\n!  width=\"55%\" | Comments\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| '''Elizabetha Patrickson'''\n| \n| 1634\n| [[England|English]]\n| \n|- valign=\"top\"\n| '''[[Jacquotte Delahaye]]'''\n| \n| 1650s-1660s\n| \n| [[Caribbean]] pirate.

R. 2001. Bandits at sea : A pirates reader. New York: New York University Press.</ref>{{rp|283}} This left women with the responsibilities of taking on traditionally male roles and filling the jobs that were left behind. The need for women to fill these roles led them to be granted rights that had historically been exclusive to men.  Women were allowed to trade, own ships, and work as retailers. Often they were innkeepers or ran alehouses. In some seaside towns, laws were even written to allow widows to keep their husbands' responsibilities and property. This was important to local economies, as alehouses and other such establishments were centers of commerce, where pirates would congregate and trade with each other and with the people onshore. \n\nAs heads of these establishments, women had a considerable amount of freedom in business. They boarded and fed pirates, bought illegally pirated goods, acted as [[pawnbroker]]s for pirates, and even gave out loans - something many men, let alone women, viewed with great caution in that time period.<ref name=\"Pennell\"/>{{rp|284}} At times, female business owners would even hide their clients when authorities came looking to arrest them for piracy.\n[[File:Mary reed02.gif|thumb|225px|right| [[Mary Read]] (1690-1721) Engraving from ''General History of the Pyrates'' 1725]] \n\n===Marriage===\nSome women chose to marry pirates. These men were often very wealthy, but their wives tended not to gain wealth as a result of their marriages, as it was difficult for pirates to send home wages and booty earned overseas. These women's houses and establishments were often used as safe havens for pirates, who were considered enemies of all nations.<ref name=\"Pennell\"/> {{rp|289\u2013290}}\n\n===Piracy===\nWomen sometimes became pirates themselves, though they tended to have to disguise themselves as men in order to do so. Pirates did not allow women onto their ships very often. Many women (and men) of the time were unable to perform the physically demanding tasks required of the crew. Additionally, women were often regarded as bad luck among pirates. It was feared that the male members of the crew would argue and fight over the women. On many ships, women (as well as young boys) were prohibited by the [[Pirate code|ship's contract]], which all crew members were required to sign.<ref name=\"Pennell\"/> {{rp|303}} \n\nBecause of the resistance to allowing women on board, many female pirates did not identify themselves as such.

Disguised as a man, she followed him on board his ship and fought alongside him. Her true identity was discovered by an [[ship's officer|officer]] who kept this knowledge to himself, wanting de Berry. He assigned her husband to the most dangerous jobs, which he survived thanks to his wife's help. The officer finally accused Charlotte's husband of [[mutiny]], of which he was found guilty based on an officer's word against that of a common sailor. He was punished and killed by flogging. The officer then made advances towards Charlotte, which she refused.  The next time they were in port she killed the officer and snuck away, dressing again as a woman and working on the docks.\n\nWhile de Berry worked on the docks, a captain of a [[Cargo ship|merchant ship]] saw her and kidnapped her. He forced de Berry to marry him and took her away on his trip to [[Africa]]. To escape her new husband who was a brutal rapist and tyrant, de Berry gained the respect of the crew and persuaded them to mutiny. In revenge, she decapitated her husband and became captain of the ship. After years of pirating, she fell in love with a Spaniard, Armelio Gonzalez. However, they were shipwrecked and after days of hunger they turned to cannibalism. The survivors of her crew were rescued by a Dutch ship, and when that ship was attacked by pirates, they bravely defended their rescuers. While the others celebrated victory, Charlotte jumped overboard in order to join her dead husband. No one knows if she survived.\n\n==Background==\nThe earliest known reference to Charlotte de Berry comes from 1836, two centuries after her birth, when she appeared in [[Edward Lloyd (publisher)|Edward Lloyd]]'s ''History of the Pirates'', a \"[[penny dreadful]]\" or \"penny blood\" - cheap stories with a fairly gory or shocking theme written to entertain the masses.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n \nMany of the incidents included in the story have parallels with other events and stories of the early 19th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Since 1836, de Berry's story has appeared in print in a number of books, but in every case it is a re-telling of the 1836 yarn. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n==References==\n* Platt, Richard (1995).

Her birth name was Anne McCormac, and her birthplace was  [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland. She was the daughter of servant woman Mary Brennan and Brennan's employer, lawyer William McCormac. Official records and contemporary letters dealing with her life are scarce and most modern knowledge stems from [[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Charles Johnson]]'s ''A General History of the Pirates'' (a collection of pirate biographies, the first edition accurate, the second much embellished).<ref name=EB /><ref name=Meltzer />\n\nAnne's father William McCormac first moved to London to get away from his wife's family, and he began dressing his daughter as a boy and calling her \"Andy\".  When discovered, McCormac moved to the Carolinas, taking along his former serving girl, the mother of Anne. Anne's father dropped the \"Mc\" from their Irish name to more easily blend into the [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charles Town]] citizenry. At first the family had a rough start in their new home, but Cormac's knowledge of law and ability to buy and sell goods soon financed a townhouse and eventually a plantation just out of town. Anne's mother died when Anne was 12. Her father attempted to establish himself as an attorney, but did not do well. Eventually, he joined the more profitable merchant business and accumulated a substantial fortune.<ref name=\"Johnson\"/> \n\nIt is recorded that Anne had red hair and was considered a \"good catch\", but may have had a fiery temper; at age 13, she supposedly stabbed a servant girl with a table knife.<ref name=Meltzer /> She married a poor sailor and small-time pirate named James Bonny.<ref name=Lorimer/> James hoped to win possession of his father-in-law's estate, but Anne was disowned by her father.\n\nThere is a story that Bonny set fire to her father's plantation in retaliation; but no evidence exists in support. However, it is known that, some time between 1714 and 1718, she and James Bonny moved to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], on [[New Providence Island]], known as a sanctuary for English pirates called the [[Republic of Pirates]].<ref name=Sharp/> Many inhabitants received a [[Royal prerogative of mercy|King's Pardon]] or otherwise evaded the law. It is also recorded that, after the arrival of Governor [[Woodes Rogers]] in the summer of 1718, James Bonny became an informant for the governor.<ref name=\"Woodard\">{{cite book\n  | last = Woodard\n  | first = Colin\n  | title = The Republic of Pirates\n  | publisher = Harcourt, Inc\n  | year = 2007\n  | pages = 139, 316\u2013318\n  |url=http://www.republicofpirates.net\n  | isbn =978-0-15-603462-3\n}}</ref>\n\n==Rackham's partner==\nWhile in the Bahamas, Bonny began mingling with pirates in the local taverns. She met [[Calico Jack|John \"Calico Jack\" Rackham]], captain of the pirate [[sloop]] ''Revenge'', and Rackham became her lover. They had a son in [[Cuba]]. Many different theories state that he was left with his family or simply [[child abandonment|abandoned]]. Bonny rejoined Rackham and continued the pirate life, having divorced her husband and marrying Rackham while at sea.

She was one of the few pirate captains to retire from piracy.\n\nChing Shih has been featured in numerous books, novels, video games, and films in Asia.\n\n== Early life ==\nShe was born Shi Xianggu ({{zh|j=sek6 heong1 gu1|t=\u77f3\u9999\u59d1}}, {{IPA-all|s\u025bk\u02e8 h\u0153\u014b\u02e5 ku\u02e5}}) in 1775 in [[Guangdong]]. She was a [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] prostitute who worked in a small brothel in [[Guangzhou]],<ref>Lily Xiao Hong Lee, A. D. Stefanowska, Clara Wing-chung Ho - 2003 - 387 pages</ref> but was captured by pirates. In 1801, she married [[Cheng I]], a notorious pirate. The name she is best remembered by simply means \"Cheng's widow\".\n\n==Marriage to Cheng I==\nCheng I belonged to a family of successful pirates who traced their criminal origins back to the mid-seventeenth century. Following his marriage to Ching Shih, \"who participated fully in her husband's piracy\",<ref name=Murray/>{{rp|71}} Cheng I used military assertion and his reputation to gather a coalition of competing Cantonese pirate fleets into an alliance. By 1804, this coalition was a formidable force, and one of the most powerful pirate fleets in all of China; by this time they were known as the Red Flag Fleet.<ref name=Murray/>{{rp|71}}\n\n==Ascension to leadership==\nOn 16 November 1807, Cheng I died in Vietnam.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Ching Shih immediately began maneuvering her way into his leadership position. She started to cultivate personal relationships to get rivals to recognize her status and solidify her authority. In order to stop her rivals before open conflict erupted, she sought the support of the most powerful members of her husband's family: his nephew Cheng Pao-yang and his cousin's son Cheng Ch'i. Then she drew on the coalition formed by her husband by building upon some of the fleet captains' existing loyalties to her husband and making herself essential to the remaining captains.<ref name=Murray/>{{rp|71}}\n\nSince Ching Shih would have such a large force at her command, she knew she needed someone to assist her in managing the Red Flag Fleet's day-to-day operations, but remain loyal to her and be accepted by the low-level pirates. She believed there was only one man for the job, Cheung Po Tsai.<ref name=Murray/>{{rp|71}}\n\n==Relationship with Cheung Po Tsai==\n[[Cheung Po Tsai]] was the son of a fisherman and had been [[Impressment|impressed into piracy]] at age 15, when he was captured by Cheng I and the two became lovers.<ref>Konstam, Dr. Angus, ''The History of Pirates''</ref> Cheung rose rapidly through the ranks and was eventually adopted by Cheng I to give him the Rights of a son and heir.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lu K'un, Ch'eng, ''Kwang-tung hai-fang hui-lan (An Examination of Kwangtung's Sea Defense)''</ref>\n\nAs soon as Ching Shih chose Cheung, she acted quickly to solidify the partnership with intimacy. The two became lovers within weeks and eventually married.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Ching Shih gave birth to a son sometime between the ages of 32 and 35 with Cheung. Cheung Po Tsai died at 36, causes unknown.\n\n==The code==\nOnce she held the fleet's leadership position, Ching Shih started the task of uniting the fleet by issuing a code of laws.<ref name=\"Maughan, Philip\"/>{{rp|28}} The Neumann translation of ''The History of Pirates Who Infested the China Sea'' claims that it was Cheung Pao Tsai that issued the code.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Murray|author2=Dian|author3=Pennell|title=Bandits at Sea: A Pirates Reader|chapter=Cheng I Sao in Fact and Fiction|p=260}}</ref> Yuan Yung-lun says that Cheung issued his own code of three regulations, called ''san-t'iao'', for his own fleet, but these are not known to exist in a written form.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite book|author=Yuan Yung-lun|title=Ching hai-fen chi (Record of the Pacification of the Pirates)}}</ref> The code was very strict and according to Richard Glasspoole, strictly enforced.<ref name=\"Glasspoole, Richard pg 44-45\">{{cite journal|author=Glasspoole, Richard|title=Substance|pp=44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nFirst, anyone giving their own orders (ones that did not come down from Ching Shih) or disobeying those of a superior were beheaded on the spot.\n\nSecond, no one was to steal from the public fund or any villagers that supplied the pirates.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThird, all goods taken as booty had to be presented for group inspection. The booty was registered by a purser and then distributed by the fleet leader. The original seizer received twenty percent and the rest was placed into the public fund.\n\nFourth, actual money was turned over to the squadron leader, who only gave a small amount back to the seizer, so the rest could be used to purchase supplies for unsuccessful ships.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Maughan, Philip\">{{cite book|author=Maughan, Philip|chapter=An Account of the Ladrones Who Infested the Coast of China|title= Further Statement of the Ladrones on the Coast of China}}</ref>{{rp|39}}  According to Philip Maughan, the punishment for a first-time offense of withholding booty was severe whipping of the back. Large amounts of withheld treasure or subsequent offenses carried the death penalty.<ref name=\"Maughan, Philip\"/>{{rp|29}}\n\nChing Shih's code had special rules for female captives. Standard practice was to release women, but J.L. Turner witnessed differently. Usually the pirates made their most beautiful captives their concubines or wives. If a pirate took a wife he had to be faithful to her.<ref name=\"Turner, J pg71\">{{Cite journal|author=Turner, J|title=Account of the Captivity of J. J. Turner, Chief Mate of the Ship Tay, Amongst the Ladrones|p=71}}</ref> The ones deemed unattractive were released and any remaining were ransomed. Pirates that raped female captives were put to death, but if pirates had consensual sex with captives, the pirate was beheaded and the woman he was with had cannonballs attached to her legs and was thrown over the side of the boat.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Maughan, Philip\"/>{{rp|29}}<ref name=\"Turner, J pg71\"/>\n\nViolations of other parts of the code were punished with flogging, clapping in irons, or quartering. Deserters or those who had left without official permission had their ears chopped off, and then were paraded around their squadron. Glasspoole concluded that the code \"gave rise to a force that was intrepid in attack, desperate in defense, and unyielding even when outnumbered.\"<ref name=\"Glasspoole, Richard pg 44-45\"/>\n\n==Career==\nThe fleet under her command established hegemony over many coastal villages, in some cases even imposing levies and taxes on settlements. According to Robert Antony, Ching Shih \"robbed towns, markets, and villages, from Macau to Canton.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Antony, Robert|title=Like Froth Floating on the Sea: The world of pirates and seafarers in Late Imperial South China|location=Berkeley|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe Red Flag Fleet under Ching Shih's rule could not be defeated\u2014not by Qing dynasty Chinese officials, not by the Portuguese navy, and not by the British.{{fact|date=May 2016}} But in 1810, amnesty was offered to all pirates, and Ching Shih took advantage of it.<ref>Andrea J.

From 1657 onward, her brother, baron [[Gustav Skytte]], secrecy managed a pirate ship, by which he attacked and plundered ships in the [[Baltic sea]]. Christina Anna and her fiance, baron [[Gustaf Drake]] (1634-1684), were also initiated in this activity and became his partners. She married Drake 18 January 1662. She and Drake reportedly had one of their partners killed, likely because he had wished to withdraw from the business. Christina Anna was no passive partner to her brother and spouse. She was reportedly herself present in person in 1662, when they attacked a Dutch merchant ship, murdered its crew and sunk the ship somewhere between [[\u00d6land]] and [[Bornholm]]. This attack exposed them, because the wreck of the ship was flushed up on the beach of \u00d6land in August of that same year. This attracted attention, and there were rumors circulating in the capital pointing them out as responsible. The Dutch envoy in Stockholm demanded action from the Swedish authorities. \n\nChristina Anna and Gustaf Drake managed to escape to Denmark to avoid arrest. Her brother did not manage to flee; he was arrested, put on trial for piracy, judged guilty as charged and executed in April 1663. Being a married woman and therefore a minor in contemporary law, Christina Anna was not personally prosecuted, but her spouse Gustaf Drake was charged in his absence and sentenced to confiscation of his property. In 1668, they returned to Sweden. Gustaf Drake was tried in Gothenburg. However, he was pardoned. He and Christina Anna thereafter settled on Edeby Manor outside [[Nyk\u00f6ping]].\n\nSkytte was portrayed in the novel ''[[Fribytaren p\u00e5 \u00d6stersj\u00f6n]]'' by [[Viktor Rydberg]].\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.sormlandsmuseum.se/Sormlandsmuseum/Utstallningar/Webbutstallningar/En-rost-om-dagen2/December/20-Anna-Christina-Skytte-/ S\u00f6rmlands museum] \n* [http://www.sormlandsmuseum.se/Sormlandsmuseum/Utstallningar/Historien-i-Sormland/Oxelosund/Pirater-sjorovare-kapare/ Pirater, sj\u00f6r\u00f6vare, kapare.

Olivier was initially married to Blanche de Bouville (died 1329). Jeanne and Olivier together had five children:\n* Maurice, (died 1334, in Blain)\n* Guillaume, \n* Olivier V, his father's successor, a future [[Constable of France]]\n* Isabeau, married John I of Rieux and therefore mother of [[Jean II de Rieux]] (died 1343) and\n* Jeanne, married Jean Harpedane, Lord of Montendre IV's successor.\n\n==De Clissons choose sides==\nDuring the [[Breton War of Succession]], the de Clissons sided with the French choice for the empty Breton ducal crown, [[Charles de Blois]], against the English preference, [[John de Montfort]].\n\n==Intrigue of Vannes==\nIn 1342, the English, after four attempts, captured [[Vannes]]. Olivier and Herv\u00e9 VII de L\u00e9on, the military commanders defending this city, were captured. Olivier was the only one released after an exchange for [[Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford]] (a prisoner of the French), and a surprisingly low sum was demanded. This led Olivier to be subsequently suspected of not having defended the city to his fullest, and he was alleged by Charles de Blois to be a traitor.\n\n==Tournament and trial==\nOn 19 January 1343, the Truce of [[Malestroit]] was signed between England and France. Under the perceived safe conditions of this truce, Olivier and fifteen other Breton lords were invited to a tournament on French soil, where he was arrested, taken to Paris, tried by his peers and on 2 August 1343, executed by beheading at [[Les Halles]].\n\n<blockquote>\"In the year of our Grace one thousand three hundred and forty-three, on Saturday, the second day of August, Olivier, Lord of Clisson, knight, prisoner in the Chatelet of Paris for several treasons and other crimes perpetrated by him against the king and the crown of France, and for alliances that he made with the king of England, enemy of the king and kingdom of France, as the said Olivier \u2026 has confessed, was by judgement of the king given at Orleans drawn from the Chatelet of Paris to Les Halles \u2026 and there on a scaffold had his head cut off. And then from there his corpse was drawn to the gibbet of Paris and there hanged on the highest level; and his head was sent to [[Nantes]] in Brittany to be put on a lance over the Sauvetout gate as a warning to others\".</small><ref>''The Law of Treason and Treason Trials in Later Medieval France'' (Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought: Third Series) Paperback \u2013 December 18, 2003</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis execution shocked the nobility as the evidence of guilt was not publicly demonstrated, and the process of exposing a body was reserved mainly for low-class criminals.\n\n[[File:Ex\u00e9cution d'Olivier IV de Clisson (1343).jpg|thumb|300px|Execution of Olivier IV de Clisson]]\n\n==Shock and revenge==\nJeanne took her two young sons, Olivier and Guillaume, from Clisson to Nantes, to show them the head of their father at the Sauvetout gate.\n\nJeanne, enraged by her husband's execution, swore retribution against the French King, [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], and Charles de Blois. She considered their actions a cowardly murder.\n\n==Change of allegiances==\nJeanne then sold the de Clisson estates and raised a  force of loyal men and started attacking French forces in Brittany.\n\nJeanne is said to have attacked a castle occupied by Galois de la Heuse, one of the officers of Charles de Blois, massacring the entire garrison with the exception of one individual.\n\nJeanne also attacked another garrison at [[Ch\u00e2teau-Th\u00e9baud]], about 20&nbsp;km south east of Nantes and a former post under control of her husband.\n\n==Black Fleet==\nWhen the fighting in Brittany became too intense, Jeanne and her sons escaped by boat, but on the trip to England, her son Guillaume died of exposure. Jeanne's remaining son, Olivier, was subsequently brought up with [[John de Montfort]] in the English court.\n\nWith the English king's assistance and Breton sympathizers, Jeanne outfitted three warships. These were painted black and their sails dyed red.  The ships of this Black Fleet then patrolled the English Channel hunting down French ships, whereupon her force would kill entire crews, leaving only a few witnesses to transmit the news to the French King. This earned Jeanne the moniker \"The Lioness of Brittany\". Jeanne continued her piracy in the channel for another 13 years.\n\nJeanne is also said to have attacked coastal villages in Normandy and have put several to sword and fire. In 1346, during the [[Battle of Crecy]], south of [[Calais]], in northern France, Jeanne used her ships to supply the English forces.\n\n==English husband==\nIn 1356, Jeanne married for a third time to [[Sir Walter Bentley (soldier)|Sir Walter Bentley]], one of [[King Edward III]]'s military deputies during the campaign. Bentley had previously won the [[battle of Mauron]] on August 4, 1352 and was rewarded for his services with \"the lands and castles \" Beauvoir-sur-mer, of Ampant, of Barre, Blaye, Ch\u00e2teauneuf, Ville Maine, the island Chauvet and from the islands of Noirmoutier and Bouin.<ref>http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_mauron.html</ref>\n\nJeanne finally settled at the Castle of [[Hennebont]], a port town on the Brittany coast, which was in the territory of her de Montfort allies, and later died there in 1359.\n\n==Historical evidence==\nVerifiable references relating to Jeanne\u2019s exploits are limited, but do exist. These include:\n\n* A French judgement from 1343 convicting Jeanne as a traitor and confirms the confiscation of the de Clisson lands. \n* Records from the English court from 1343, indicating King Edward granting Jeanne an income from lands controlled in Brittany by the English. \n* Jeanne is mentioned in the truce between France and England in 1347 as an English ally.

The de Clisson family was at that stage definitely on the de Montfort side.\n* Records exist where shortly after Olivier de Clisson's execution, several other knights were accused of similar crimes. The lord of Malestroit and his son, the lord of Avaugour, sir Tibaut de Morillon, and other lords of Brittany, to the number of ten knights and squires, were beheaded at Paris. Four other knights of Normandy, sir William Baron, sir Henry de Malestroit, the lord of Rochetesson, and sir Richard de Persy, were put to death upon reports.\n\n==Literature==\nIn 1868, French writer \u00c9mile Pehant's novel ''Jeanne de Belleville'' was published in France.

She reportedly arrived to Tortuga during the reign of [[Betrand d'Ogeron de la Bouere]], who was governor of the island in 1665-1668 and 1669-1675. In 1684, she married buccaneer Pierre Lelong, who was killed in a fight 15 July 1690. With him, she had one child, Marie Marguerite Yvonne Lelong (1688-1774). In 1691, she married Joseph Cherel, who in turn died in June 1693. With him she had another child: Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e9rel (1692-1732).\n\nIn March 1693, she met and married the famous buccaneer [[Laurens de Graaf]]. He agreed to marry her after she threatened to shoot him for insulting her.<ref>Blood and Silver: A History of Piracy in the Caribbean and Central America by Kris E. Lane (Signal Books, 1999)</ref>\n<ref group=\"note\">According to Vaissi\u00e8re, the two were married in 1693 and their daughter was recorded as twelve years old in 1704.</ref>\n\nAccording to the traditional description of the event, Anne challenged de Graff to a duel to avenge the death of her late spouse. While Laurens drew his sword, Anne drew her gun, after which Laurens succumbed by saying he would not fight a female. He then proposed to her in admiration of her courage.<ref>Pierre Margry, Relations et m\u00e9moires in\u00e9dits pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la France sous les Pays d'outre-mer tir\u00e9s des archives du minist\u00e8re de la marine et des colonies, Challamel, 1867</ref> Anne and Laurens de Graaf married 28 July 1693. During her marriage she had two children, a daughter, Marie Catherine de Graff (1694-1743), and a son who died as a child (1700-1705)\n\n==Anne God-Wants==\nAnne Dieu-Le-Veut is referred to as a pirate because she accompanied Laurens de Graaf on his pirate ship during his acts of piracy. Usually, it was considered bad luck to have a female on board a ship, but Anne was instead regarded as a mascot and a good luck charm.<ref>Jean-Jacques Seymour, Les chemins des proies: une histoire de la flibuste, Ibis Rouge \u00c9d., 2010, 299 p.</ref>\n\nIt is claimed that she actively participated in his piracy and fought by his side during acts of piracy, sharing his work and the command on his ship in the same fashion as [[Anne Bonny]] did with [[Calico Jack]], though unlike Bonny she did not hide her sex. The stories about her attracted attention and she has been described as brave, stern and ruthless. Apparently, it was during these years her name Anne Dieu-Le-Veut (\"Anne God-Wants\") became known.\n\nIn 1693, Laurens de Graaf raided English [[Jamaica]]. As recognition, he was given the noble title of Chevalier and the position of Major Lieutenant and the commission of Ile-a-Vache. The English retaliated in May 1695 with an attack on ''[[Port-de-Paix]]'' at Saint Domingue, where they sacked the town and captured Anne and her children.<ref>Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the New World, 1492 to the Present by David Marley (ABC-CLIO, 1998)</ref> They were kept as hostages for three years, despite the attempts made by France to release them.\n\nIn 1698, she was released and reunited with her spouse. With the exception of her death date, her release is the last year in which she is mentioned. The later life of her as well as Laurens de Graff is not well known, though their death dates is known. According to some versions, they eventually settled in Louisiana or Mississippi.\n\nOne of her daughters eventually became known for having performed a duel with a man, which was then said to have made her a worthy daughter of her mother.\n\n==Legend==\nThere were several stories and legends concerning Anne.\n\nThere is one legend depicting Anne becoming a widow. As Anne and Laurens attacked a Spanish ship, a cannonball took the life of Laurens. Anne took his place as commander of his ship, as she had done before, hurled their crew of pirates on with fury in the fight against the Spaniards. However, the pirates were outnumbered, and they were all captured and taken first to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] in [[Mexico]], and then to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in [[Colombia]], both of which were cities earlier sacked by Laurens, to be judged. Anne's fame was so great that when the French Marine Secretary of Pontchartrain heard of this, he wrote to [[Louis XIV]] of France and asked him to make the king of Spain intervene. Anne was then freed as a special service between kings, and she was never heard of again.\n\nThis story is not confirmed. If Laurens and Anne settled in Mississippi after 1698 as have been suggested, it would not have prevented them from continuing their career of piracy. If historical, it would have happened in 1704, which was the year of Laurens' death. As Tortuga was closed as a pirate base in 1697, Mississippi would have been a better base for such activity, and piracy toward Spain could have been supported by the French crown the [[Spanish War of Succession]] in 1700-1714. If so, an intervention by an official from Pontchartrain in French Louisiana would not have been illogical. As one of the rivaling Spanish kings during that period was a French prince, it would have made it easy to receive a Spanish royal pardon by way of the French monarch.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://books.google.se/books?id=C-TWAAAAMAAJ&q=Jacquotte+Delahaye&dq=Jacquotte+Delahaye&hl=sv&sa=X&ei=N7XuUr7OHuHjywOFqILYCQ&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg Ulrike Klausmann, Marion Meinzerin, Gabriel Kuhn: Women pirates and the politics of the Jolly Roger Black Rose Books, 1997]\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/426776\n\n{{Pirates}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dieu-Le-Veut, Anne}}\n[[Category:Female duellists]]\n[[Category:Female pirates]]\n[[Category:French pirates]]\n[[Category:1661 births]]\n[[Category:1710 deaths]]\n[[Category:Women in 17th-century warfare]]\n[[Category:Women in war in France]]\n[[Category:People of Saint-Domingue]]\n[[Category:18th-century pirates]]\n[[Category:17th-century pirates]]"}]},"38099616":{"pageid":38099616,"ns":0,"title":"Elise Eskilsdotter","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"'''Elise Eskilsdotter''' (''Elise Eskildsdatter'') was a 15th-century Norwegian noblewoman.  <ref>{{cite web|url=   https://nbl.snl.no/Elise_Eskildsdatter |title=   Elise Eskildsdatter, Ridderfrue|publisher=   Norsk biografisk leksikon |author=     Terje Bratberg |accessdate= May 25,  2016}}</ref>\n\nElise was the daughter of Eskild \u00c5gesen and Elisabeth Jakobsdatter Hegle.

Olav later served King [[Christian I of Denmark]] as a privateer during the [[Dano-Hanseatic War (1426\u201335)|Dano-Hanseatic War]] (1426\u201335).  After king Christian made peace with the [[Hanseatic League]], Olav continued to attack German merchant ships against the wishes of the  king. Olav conducted a personal war of piracy. As a consequence, in 1453 the king dismissed Olav. In 1455, Olav Nilsson was assassinated at [[Munkeliv Abbey]]  together with his son Nils, his brother Peder Nilsson Skanke, as well as Thorleiv Olavsson, Bishop of Bergen.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=   https://nbl.snl.no/Olav_Nilsson|title=  Olav Nilsson, Ridder|publisher=   Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=   Erik Opsahl  |accessdate= May 25,  2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=   http://www.skankeforeningen.no/index.php/artikler/34-bruk-av-to-bensvapen-i-skanke-aetten|title=  Herr Olav Nilsson \u2013 Ridder af Talg\u00f8|publisher= Skanke-Foreningen I Norge |author=    John Arve Riise  |accessdate= May 25,  2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=   http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bolavs.html|title=   Leif Thor Olafsson, Bishop of Bj\u00f8rgvin (Bergen)|publisher=   Hierarchia Catholica, Volume 2 |accessdate= May 25,  2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his death, Elise Eskilsdotter and her children led open warfare against the German merchant class of Bergen by means of piracy against their trade.

He was making a fortune, and was ennobled in 1715.\n\nIngela had met Lars when they were children, as the farms of their parents were next to each other. They had five children, and she is believed to have been not only his wife but also his companion in his professional life, and the brain behind a lot of his plans as a privateer and pirate. They both ran the affairs from their base in [[Gothenburg]]. When her husband died in 1718, Ingela took over his Privateering (and his alleged Pirate empire), continued its business and also expanded it during the remaining war. She was called the Shipping Queen.\n\nSwedish privateering ended after the peace treaty with Denmark in 1720 and Russia in 1721. Ingela married the lieutenant [[Isak Browald]] in 1722, and in 1729 was buried with her first husband in Onsala.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* http://www.ericsonwolke.se/las_mer_lasse_i_gatan.htm\n* http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=97619594-9250-4e8b-bd79-18262a683f31\n* G\u00f6teborg - handbok f\u00f6r resande, Octavia Carl\u00e9n 1869 s.125-130\n* Ber\u00e4ttelser ur G\u00f6teborgs Historia under env\u00e5ldstiden, H.Fr\u00f6ding 1922 s.300-315\n* Majornas Kyrkokr\u00f6nika, Per Pehrsson 1926\n* Det forna Majorna, Axel Ros\u00e9n 1940\n* Kronologiska anteckningar om viktigare h\u00e4ndelser i G\u00f6teborg 1619-1982, G\u00f6teborgs Hembygdsf\u00f6rbund 1982\n* G\u00f6teborg ber\u00e4ttar, Bengt A. \u00d6hnander 1991\n* G\u00f6teborgs gatunamn, Greta Baum 2001\n* Lasse i Gatan - Kaparkriget och det svenska stormaktsv\u00e4ldets fall, Milit\u00e4rhistoriker Lars Ericson/Historiska Media 1997 s.77-87\n* Ingela Hammar, R\u00f6tter - Anbytarforum\n{{Pirates}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gathenhielm, Ingela}}\n[[Category:1692 births]]\n[[Category:Privateers]]\n[[Category:Female pirates]]\n[[Category:Women in 18th-century warfare]]\n[[Category:Swedish pirates]]\n[[Category:18th-century Swedish people]]\n[[Category:1729 deaths]]\n[[Category:Women in war in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Swedish people of the Great Northern War]]\n[[Category:18th-century Swedish businesspeople]]\n[[Category:18th-century pirates]]\n{{Piracy-stub}}"}]},"38500163":{"pageid":38500163,"ns":0,"title":"Johanna H\u00e5rd","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Expand Swedish|Johanna H\u00e5rd|date=February 2013}}\n'''Johanna H\u00e5rd''', [[n\u00e9e]] ''Jungberg'' (3 December 1789 &ndash; 12 March 1851), was a Swedish pirate.\n\nShe was the widow of Fredrik H\u00e5rd and lived on [[Vr\u00e5ng\u00f6]].

She was a product of the Gaelic world of her time and, despite her interaction with English officials, may have known no English. She was apparently well-educated and was regarded by contemporaries as being exceptionally formidable and competent.\n\nUpon her father's death she inherited his large shipping and trading business (a trade sometimes referred to as mere [[pirate|piracy]]). The income from this business, the land inherited from her mother, and the property and holdings from her first husband, D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh (D\u00f3nal \"the warlike\") \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh, allowed her to become very wealthy (reportedly owning as much as 1000 head of cattle and horses). In 1593, when her sons Tibbot Burke (Tiob\u00f3id de B\u00farca) and Murrough O'Flaherty (Murchadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh), and her half-brother D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa (\"D\u00f3nal of the Pipes\") were taken captive by the English governor of [[Connacht]], Sir [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Richard Bingham]], O'Malley sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to [[Elizabeth I]] at her court in [[Greenwich Palace]].\n\nCommonly known as Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol (anglicised as '''Granuaile''') in [[Irish folklore]], she is a well-known historical figure in 16th-century [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|Irish history]], and is sometimes known as \"The Sea Queen of [[Connacht]]\". Her biography has been written by historian [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]]. Her name was rendered in contemporary documents various ways including Gr\u00e1inne O'Maly, Graney O'Mally, Grainne N\u00ed Maille, Granny ni Maille, Grany O'Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O'Maly, and Granee O'Maillie.<ref name=\"chambers39\">{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=39}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nO'Malley was born in Ireland around 1530, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was [[King of England]] and (at least in name) [[Lord of Ireland]]. Under the policies of the [[English government]] at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However this was to change over the course of O'Malley's life as the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] gathered pace.\n\nEoghan Dubhdara \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, her father<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=20}}</ref> and his family were based in [[Clew Bay]], [[County Mayo]]. He was chieftain of the \u00d3 M\u00e1ille clan and a direct descendant of its [[eponym]], [[Maille mac Conall]]. The U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille (O'Malleys) were one of the few seafaring families on the west coast, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of [[Murrisk]]<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=20}}</ref> in South-West County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the [[Mac William \u00cdochtar|Mac Uilliam \u00cdochtair]] branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo (the Bourkes (DeBurca) were originally [[Anglo-Norman]] but by her lifetime completely [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]). Her mother, [[Margaret (name)|Margaret]] or [[Maeve]], was also a N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a half-brother called D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa, the son of her father.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family (see [[Chiefs of the Name]]) was known simply by his surname as \u00d3 M\u00e1ille (anglicised as The O'Malley). Local folklore had it that as a young girl O'Malley wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname \"Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol\" ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8\u0261r\u0251\u02d0n\u02b2\u0259 ve\u02d0l}}; from ''maol'' meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile.<ref>as used to name the ships ILV ''Granuaile'' of the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]]</ref> The nickname may also come from \"Gr\u00e1inne Umhaill\" (\"Gr\u00e1inne of Umhaill,\" Umhall being an historical district of west [[Connacht]] dominated by the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille).<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p= 57}}</ref>\n\nAs a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and [[Clare Island]],<ref name=\"chambers39\"/> but she may have been fostered to another family since [[fosterage]] was traditional among [[Irish people|Irish]] nobility at the time. She was probably formally educated, since she is believed to have spoken in [[Latin]] with Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in 1593.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\">{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=36}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to O'Flaherty==\n[[File:Clare Island.jpg|thumb|250px|Clare Island, associated with Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley]]\nO'Malley was married in 1546 to [[\u00d3 Flaithbertaigh|D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]], [[t\u00e1naiste]] or heir to the \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ([[O'Flaherty]]) title, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the \u00d3 M\u00e1ille chieftain. As O'Flaherty t\u00e1naiste, D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh one day expected to rule [[Iar Connacht]], the area roughly equivalent to modern [[Conamara]].<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=42}}</ref>\n\nShe bore three children during her marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh:\n\n* Owen (Eoghan):<ref name=\"chambers44\">{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=44}}</ref> The eldest child and son, known to be kind and forgiving. When Owen was in his late twenties or early thirties, [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Richard Bingham]] tricked him and, as a result, Owen was murdered and Bingham and his troops took over Owen's castle.\n* Margaret (M\u00e9adhbh):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Sometimes called 'Maeve', Margaret was much like her mother. She married and had several children. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and Margaret's husband, Richard \"the Devil's Hook\" (Deamhan an Chorr\u00e1in) Bourke,were supposedly very close, and more than once N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's son-in-law saved her from death.\n* Murrough (Murchadh):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Murrough was said to take after his father as he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Margaret, and refused to listen to his mother because of her gender. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When O'Malley heard of this she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him. She returned after his death to Mayo and took up residence at the family castle or tower-house on [[Clare Island]]. After D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh's death, O'Malley left Iar-[[Connacht]] and returned to O'Mh\u00e1ille territory, taking with her many O'Flaherty followers.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=45}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to Burke==\n[[File:Carrickahowley (Rockfleet) Castle County Mayo.JPG|thumb|right|[[Rockfleet Castle]]]]\nBy 1566, O'Malley had married a second time, this time to [[Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn Bourke|Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn (\"Iron Richard\") Bourke]].<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=63}}</ref> His nickname may derive from his wearing a coat of mail inherited from his [[Anglo-Norman]] ancestors or from his control of the ironworks at [[Burrishoole Friary|Burrishoole]], the place of his principal castle and residence.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|pp= 64, 66}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally it is said that the Bourke marriage was motivated by O'Malley's desire to enlarge her holdings and prestige. Bourke was owner of [[Rockfleet Castle]], also called Carraigahowley Castle (''Carraig an Chabhlaigh'' - \"the rock of the fleet\"), strategically situated near [[Newport, County Mayo]], as well as other lands like Burrishoole, with sheltered harbours in which a pirate ship could hide. Bourke was chieftain of a senior branch of his sept,<ref>[http://www3.dcs.hull.ac.uk/cgi-bin/gedlkup/n=royal?royal09218 Risdeard / Richard's family tree online]</ref> which would eventually make him be eligible for election as Mac William, the second most powerful office in Connacht.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|pp=64\u201365}}</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition the couple married under [[Early Irish law]] 'for one year certain', and it is said that when the year was up O'Malley divorced Risde\u00e1rd and kept the castle. Legend says that O'Malley and her followers locked themselves in Rockfleet Castle and she called out a window to Burke, \"Richard Burke, I dismiss you.\" Those words had the effect of ending the marriage, but since she was in possession of the castle she kept it.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|pp=65\u201366}}</ref> Rockfleet remained for centuries in the O'Malley family and is today open to the public. Despite the divorce story, O'Malley and Bourke are mentioned as husband and wife in English documents of the period, and so appear in English eyes to have remained married, or at least to have been allied. Answering questions from Elizabeth I, O'Malley said she was his widow.\n\nThe pair had one son, [[Tibbot ne Long Bourke, 1st Viscount Mayo|Tiob\u00f3id]], nicknamed \"Tibbot of the Ships\" ({{lang-ga|Tiob\u00f3id na Long}}), who was born about 1567.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=67}}</ref> Tibbot was later knighted as Sir Theobald Bourke, and was created [[Viscount Mayo#Viscounts Mayo .281626.29|1st Viscount Mayo]] in 1626 by [[Charles I of England]]. Bourke had at least four other children from other marriages: Edmund, Walter, John, and Catherine.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=64}}</ref>\n\n==Other relationships==\nO'Malley was accused of [[promiscuity]] and it was said that she may have had a son out of wedlock. Biographer [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]] points out that despite hints at these facts in certain state documents, allegations such as these were frequently made against women who acted in a manner contrary to the [[social norm]]s of the day.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|pp=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThe Chambers biography relates that the legendary reason for her seizure of Doona Castle in Ballycroy was because the MacMahons, who owned the castle, killed her lover Hugh de Lacy, who was easily fifteen years younger than she was. He was the shipwrecked son of a [[Wexford]] merchant and O'Malley had rescued him.<ref name=\"chambers55-56\">{{harv|Chambers|2003|pp=55\u201356}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nEven as a young woman O'Malley was involved in the business of sailing ships and international trade.<ref>1593 Petition of Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille to Queen Elizabeth, State Papers Relating to Ireland (on microfilm, originals in the Public Record Office, London) SP 63/171/18</ref> She probably learned the business from her father who plied a busy international shipping trade. It is known that she always wanted to join his fleets, but he always refused. Bunowen Castle, where she lived with her first husband, was situated on the most western point in [[Connacht]] and was apparently the first base for her shipping and trade activities. By the time of D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh's death in the early 1560s she commanded the loyalty of so many O'Flaherty men that many of them left the area when she did and followed her to [[Clare Island]] in [[Clew Bay]], where she moved her headquarters.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|pp=45, 50}}</ref>\n\nHer first husband had taken a fortress in the [[Lough Corrib]] from the Joyce clan. Because of D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh's attitude, the Joyces began calling that particular fortress \"Cock's Castle.\"  When they heard of his death, they decided to take back the castle, but O'Malley successfully defended it. It was said that her deportment so impressed the Joyces that they renamed the castle ''Caisle\u00e1n na Circe'', the \"Hen's Castle\". It was also said that she successfully defended it against English attack.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=49}}</ref>\n\nAround the time of her first husband's death came the initial complaints to the English Council in Dublin from [[Galway]]'s city leaders that O'Flaherty and O'Malley ships were behaving like pirates. Because Galway imposed taxes on the ships that traded their goods there, the O'Flahertys, led by O'Malley, decided to extract a similar tax from ships travelling in waters off their lands. O'Malley's ships would stop and board the traders and demand either cash or a portion of the cargo in exchange for safe passage the rest of the way to Galway. Resistance was met with violence and even murder. Once they obtained their toll, the O'Flaherty ships would disappear into one of the many bays in the area.<ref>Chambers, Anne: ''Ireland's Pirate Queen: The True Story of Grace O'Malley,'' p. 45-46. New York: MJF, 2003.</ref><ref>Calendar of State Papers Relating to Ireland (Elizabeth I), vol. 207, p. 5. (London 1860\u20131912)</ref>\n\nBy the early 1560s, O'Malley had left O'Flaherty territory and returned to her father's holdings on Clare Island.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=51}}</ref> She recruited fighting men from both Ireland and Scotland, transporting the [[gallowglass]] mercenaries between their Scottish homes and Irish employers and plundering Scotland's outlying islands on her return trips.<ref name=\"chambers52\">{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=52}}</ref> In an apparent effort to curry favour with the English, O'Malley went to the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] and offered two hundred fighting men to serve English interests in Ireland and Scotland.<ref name=\"chambers52\"/>\n\nShe attacked ships as far away as [[Waterford]] on the south central coast of Ireland and fortresses on the shoreline, including Curradh Castle at Renvyle, the O'Loughlin castle in [[the Burren]] and the O'Boyle and MacSweeney clans in their holdings in [[Burtonport]], [[Killybegs]] and [[Lough Swilly]].<ref name=\"chambers54\">{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=54}}</ref>\n\nIn 1577, she met with [[Sir Henry Sidney]], the Lord Deputy of Ireland, who already knew of her since she had met his son, [[Sir Philip Sidney]], in 1576. Although Philip Sidney would have been a very young man at the time, O'Malley evidently made an impression on him since he mentioned her in favourable terms to his father.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\"/> O'Malley was wealthy on land as well as by sea. She inherited her father's fleet of ships and land holdings, as well as the land her mother had owned. Around the time of her meeting with Queen Elizabeth I of England, she owned herds of cattle and horses that numbered at least one thousand, comprising great riches by the standards of the time.<ref name=\"chambers54\"/>\n\n==Legendary exploits==\nMany folk stories  about O'Malley have survived. There are also songs and poems about her.\n\nA widespread legend concerns an incident at [[Howth]], which apparently occurred in 1576. During a trip from Dublin, O'Malley attempted to pay a courtesy visit to [[Howth Castle]], home of [[Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth (d. 1589)|Lord Howth]]. However, she was informed that the family was at dinner and the castle gates were closed against her. In retaliation, she abducted the Earl's grandson and heir, [[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]. He was eventually released when a promise was given to keep the gates open to unexpected visitors and to set an extra place at every meal. Lord Howth gave her a ring as pledge on the agreement. The ring remains in the possession of a descendant of O'Malley and, at Howth Castle today, this agreement is still honoured by the Gaisford St. Lawrence family, descendants of the Baron.<ref>Chambers, Anne: ''Ireland's Pirate Queen: The True Story of Grace O'Malley,'' p. 56-58. New York: MJF, 2003.</ref> (Commemorating these events, there is in Howth a street of 1950s local council housing named 'Grace O'Malley Road'.)\n\nThe legendary reason for O'Malley seizure of Doona Castle in Ballycroy was that the MacMahons, who owned the castle, killed her lover, Hugh de Lacy, the shipwrecked son of a Wexford merchant she had rescued. When the guilty members of the MacMahon clan landed on the holy island of Caher for a pilgrimage, O'Malley captured their boats. She and her men then captured the MacMahons and killed those responsible for her lover's death. Still not satisfied with her revenge, O'Malley then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself.<ref name=\"chambers55-56\"/> Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another chieftain who stole property from O'Malley and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=56}}</ref>\n\nMore than 20 years after her death, an English lord deputy of Ireland recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the [[Irish people]].<ref>{{harv|Chambers|2003|p=53}}</ref><ref>Calendar of State Papers Relating to Ireland (James I) 1623, no. 997. (London 1860\u20131912)</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary activity==\nIn 1593, in his letter to protesting O'Malley's claims against him, [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Richard Bingham]] claimed that she was \"nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years\".<ref name=\"chambers52\"/><ref>Lambeth Palace Library MS 601, p. 111</ref> Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, with the task of controlling local lords who had until then been effectively self-governing.\n\nO'Malley had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] over her part of the country. Her castle at Clare Island was attacked by an expedition from [[Galway]] led by Sheriff [[William \u00d3ge Martyn]] in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.\n\n==Meeting with Elizabeth==\n{{More footnotes|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|250px|The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I (a later illustration from ''Anthologia Hibernica'', vol. 11, 1793)]]\nIn the later 16th century, English power steadily increased in Ireland and O'Malley's power was steadily encroached upon. Finally, in 1593, when her sons, Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother, D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa, were taken captive by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, O'Malley sailed to England to petition Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth I famously sent O'Malley a list of questions, which she answered and returned to Elizabeth. O'Malley met with Elizabeth at Greenwich Palace, wearing a fine gown, the two of them surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal Court. O'Malley refused to bow before Elizabeth because she did not recognise her as the Queen of Ireland. It is also rumoured that O'Malley had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but O'Malley informed the queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled. Some also reported that O'Malley sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into the handkerchief and then threw the piece of cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. O'Malley informed Elizabeth and her court that, in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was destroyed. Their discussion was carried out in Latin, as O'Malley spoke no English and Elizabeth spoke no Irish.\n\nAfter much talk, the two women came to an agreement. Included in the stipulations for each party, Elizabeth was to remove Sir Bingham from his position in Ireland and O'Malley was to stop supporting the Irish lords' rebellions. The meeting seemed to have done some good for Richard Bingham was removed from service. But several of O'Malley's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet, and within a rather short period of time Elizabeth sent Bingham back to Ireland. Upon Bingham's return, O'Malley realised that the meeting with Elizabeth had been useless, and went back to supporting Irish insurgents during the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]]. She most likely died at Rockfleet Castle around 1603, the same year as Elizabeth, though the year and place of her death are disputed.\n\n==Biographical sources==\nDocumentary evidence for O'Malley's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The O'Malley family \"book,\" a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory,\" questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I.<ref>See the supplement to Chambers, 2003.</ref> She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy Sir [[Henry Sidney]] to his son [[Phillip Sidney|Phillip]] in 1577: \"There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men...\"<ref>Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85</ref>\n\nLocal traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the [[Ordnance Survey Memoirs of Ireland|Ordnance Survey of Ireland]]. In a letter of 1838 he describes her as being \"most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally\".\n\n:Charles Cormick of Erris, now 74 years and six weeks old, saw and conversed with Elizabeth O'Donnell of Newtown within the Mullet, who died about 65 years ago who had seen and intimately known a Mr Walsh who remembered Gr\u00e1inne. Walsh died at the age of 107 and his father was the same age as Gr\u00e1inne.<ref>Gaisford St Lawrence Papers, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 73</ref>\n\nA story is recorded of O'Malley chiding her son Theobald in the course of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: \"An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo th\u00f3in at\u00e1 t\u00fa, an \u00e1it a dt\u00e1inig t\u00fa as?\" (Are you trying to hide behind me, where I gave birth to you?).<ref name=\"Ordnance Survey Letters 2003\">Ordnance Survey Letters, Mayo, vol.

The current house was built close to the site of Cahernamart (''Cathair na Mart'' - \"fort of the slaughtered cows\"), an O'Malley fort.

'''Mark Read''', was an English [[pirate]].  She and [[Anne Bonny]] are two of the most famed female pirates of all time; they are the only two [[women in piracy|women]] known to have been convicted of piracy during the early 18th century, at the height of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nMary Read was illegitimately born in <!--Plymouth --> England, in the late 17th century, to the widow of a sea captain. Her date of birth is disputed among historians because of a reference to the \"[[Peace of Ryswick]]\" by her contemporary biographer [[Captain Charles Johnson]] in ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]''. He very well may have made an error, intending to refer to the \"[[Treaty of Utrecht]]\". Whichever it is, her birth was around 1691.\n\nBecause she had become pregnant as a result of an affair following the disappearance of her husband, Read's mother attempted to hide the birth of her daughter, Mary.  She first began to disguise illegitimately born Mary as a boy after the death of Mary's older, legitimate brother Mark. This was done in order to continue to receive financial support from Read's paternal grandmother. The grandmother was apparently fooled, and Read and her mother lived on the inheritance into her teenage years. Still dressed as a boy, Read then found work as a [[Footman|foot-boy]], and later found employment on a ship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cordingly|first1=David|title=Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates|date=1996|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=61}}</ref>\n\nShe later joined the [[British military]], allied with Dutch forces against the French (this could have been during the [[Nine Years War]] or during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]). Read, in male disguise, proved herself through battle, but she fell in love with a Flemish soldier. When they married, she used their military commission and gifts from intrigued brethren in arms as a funding source to acquire an inn named \"De drie hoefijzers\" (\"The Three Horseshoes\") near [[Breda Castle]] in The Netherlands.\n\nUpon her husband's early death, Read resumed male dress and military service in Holland. With peace, there was no room for advancement, so she quit and boarded a ship bound for the [[West Indies]].\n\n==Becoming a pirate==\n[[File:A contemporary engraving of Mary Read.JPG|thumb|A contemporary engraving of Mary Read]]\nRead's ship was taken by pirates, who forced her to join them. She took the King's pardon c.1718-1719, and took a commission to privateer, until that ended with her joining the crew in mutiny. In 1720 she joined pirate John \"[[Calico Jack]]\" Rackham and his companion, the female pirate [[Anne Bonny]], who both believed her to be a man. On 22 August 1720 the three stole an armed [[sloop]] named ''William''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rogers|first1=Woodes|title=A proclamation|accessdate=15 June 2015|publisher=The Boston Gazette|date=10 October 1720}}</ref> from port in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]].<ref name=CWRead /><ref name=DC2006 />\n\nRead's gender was revealed when Bonny told Read that she was a woman, apparently because she was attracted to her. Realising this, Read revealed that she too was a woman. However, Rackham, as Bonny's lover, did not know this and suspected romantic involvement between the two. To abate his jealousy, Bonny told him that Read was also a woman.\n\n==Capture and imprisonment==\nOn 15 November 1720 pirate hunter Captain Jonathan Barnet took Rackham's crew by surprise while they were hosting a rum party with another crew of Englishmen at Negril Point off the west coast of [[Jamaica]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pallardy|first1=Richard|title=Anne Bonny|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Anne-Bonny#ref1086283|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref> After a volley of fire left the pirate vessel disabled, Rackham's crew and their \"guests\" fled to the hold, leaving only the women and one other to fight Barnet's boarding party<ref name=DC2006>{{cite book|last1=Cordingly|first1=David|title=Under the Black Flag|date=2006|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0812977226|pages=57\u201358}}</ref> (it is also possible that Rackham and his crew were too drunk to fight.) Allegedly, Read angrily shot into the hold, killing one, and wounding others when the men would not come up and fight with them. Barnet's crew eventually overcame the women. Rackham surrendered, requesting \"[[no quarter|quarter]].\"<ref name=RB1721>{{cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=Robert|title=''The Trials of Captain John Rackam and other Pirates''|date=1721|ref=CO 137/14/1|location=Jamaica}}</ref>\n\nRackham and his crew were arrested and brought to trial in what is now known as [[Spanish Town, Jamaica]], where they were sentenced to hang for acts of piracy, as were Read and Bonny.

Mary's father-in-law John III Killigrew (d.1567) was appointed by the king as the first hereditary [[Governor of Pendennis Castle]], and after his death Queen Elizabeth I appointed as second Governor his son Sir John IV Killigrew. The Governorship allowed control to be exerted of all of the shipping in the [[Carrick Roads]] harbour (the third largest natural harbour in the world), and along part of the south coast. Sir John IV Killigrew used his  privileged position to prey on the cargoes of the ships that came within his reach. In 1567 Arwenack House was fortified as a stronghold and used to store merchandise stolen in raids on ships. Mary and her husband paid large fees to officials, bribing them to allow  their illicit activities. Mary played an active role in the piracy, and apparently enjoyed the adventure more than her husband.<ref name=\"AWS\">{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=Anne Wallace|title=Daring Pirate Women|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tbvZLaFhCWMC&lpg=PP1&dq=Daring%20Pirate%20Women&pg=PA45#v=onepage&f=false|year=2002|publisher=Lerner Publications|pages=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Neville Williams described Mary (whom he erroneously called \"Elizabeth\") as a \"tough and unprincipled businesswoman\" who managed Arwenack House and oversaw the burial of treasure in her garden.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Kathy Lynn Emerson, ''A Who's Who of Tudor Women''</ref> In January 1582 Mary, by that time in her 60s, heard a rumour that there was treasure aboard the Spanish ship ''Marie of San Sebastian'' anchored opposite Arwenack House, and she sent her servants to seize the ship and search the cargo.
