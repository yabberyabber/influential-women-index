Adams was one of the first to announce that if Watt were confirmed, she would run in the ensuing special election.  After Watt was confirmed in December, Adams formally filed paperwork to run in both the Democratic primary for a full two-year term in the [[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]] and the [[North Carolina's 12th congressional district special election, 2014|special election]] for the balance of Watt's 11th term.<ref name=kickoff>{{cite web|last=Cahn |first=Emily |url=http://atr.rollcall.com/watt-confirmation-kicks-off-north-carolina-special-election/ |title=Roll Call: Watt Confirmation Kicks Off North Carolina Special Election |publisher=Atr.rollcall.com |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnalysts thought that Adams was at a geographic disadvantage in the five-way primary for both the special and regular elections (held on the same day).  She is from Greensboro, but the bulk of the district's population is in Charlotte. The three Charlotteans in the race split that region's vote; and Adams won both primaries with approximately 44 percent of the vote, a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid a [[two-round system|runoff]].  She faced Republican Vince Coakley, a former television and radio broadcaster from Matthews, in both the general and special elections, which were held on the same day in November. The 12th is a heavily Democratic district with a majority-black voting population and a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+26, and Adams was overwhelmingly favored in the general election.  She won both handily.\n\nAdams is the second woman of color to represent North Carolina in the House.  The first was [[Eva Clayton]], who represented much of eastern North Carolina from 1992 to 2002.\n\n==Adams' residency questioned==\n\nA court-ordered redistricting in 2016 made the 12th somewhat more compact.  It now comprised nearly all of [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg County]], home to Charlotte.  Adams' home in Greensboro was drawn into the 13th district.  Adams had already filed for a second full term, but announced she would move to Charlotte.<ref>[http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article65183332.html Charlotte Observer]</ref>  She claims the home of Dr. Mary Gaffney,<ref>[http://meckcama.co.mecklenburg.nc.us/relookup/ Mecklenburg County Real Estate Lookup]</ref> one of her prominent supporters,<ref>[https://act.myngp.com/Forms/-2855433295976069120 Alma Adams for Congress]</ref> in Charlotte's Fourth Ward neighborhood as her official residence in the district. Both Gaffney and Adams maintain active voter registrations at that address.<ref>[https://vt.ncsbe.gov/voter_search_public/ NCSBE Public Voter Search]</ref> However, on May 31, [[WBTV]] in Charlotte reported that Adams filed campaign finance documents listing her longtime home in Greensboro as her residence, and also spends most weekends in her Greensboro home.  The WBTV report also revealed that Adams had scrubbed all references to her service as a local official in Greensboro from her campaign website, though her biography on her campaign's Facebook page still contains references to that service.<ref>Ochsner, Nick.

[[WBTV]], 2016-05-31.</ref>  When a WBTV reporter approached Adams at her home in Greensboro, she backed out of her driveway and drove away and was later found hiding out in her car near the entrance to her neighborhood. When the reporter attempted to confront her, she drove away a second time.<ref>Ochsner, Nick. [http://www.wbtv.com/clip/12475594/reporters-notebook-alma-adams]. [[WBTV]], 2016-05-31.</ref>  While members of Congress are only required to live in the state they represent, it has become a strong convention that they live in or close to the district they represent.\n\nHowever, with seven Charlotteans splitting the vote, Adams won the primary with 42 percent.  This all but assured her of a second full term; due to Mecklenburg County's heavy swing to the Democrats in recent years, the reconfigured 12th is no less Democratic than its predecessor.\n\n==Legislative career==\nAdams was previously a member of the Greensboro City School Board from 1984 to 1986 and a Greensboro City Council member from 1987 until her appointment to the house seat in 1994.<ref name=NCManual /><ref name=\"Gist seat\" />\n\nIn 2008, Adams was elected to a second term as chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black

Many of her early legislative efforts centered around juvenile issues and limiting garnishment of wages.\n\nA lot of what she achieved influenced her to convince others to run after their dream, so she went to children's hospitals and encouraged some of the children to never give up. She said: \"No matter what is in your way never give up and chase after your dream, with no interference of discouragement.\"\n\n==Terms in U.S. Congress==\n[[File:Yvonne Brathwaite.jpg|thumb|left|Yvonne Brathwaite Burke]]During her tenure in Congress, she served on the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] and the [[House Committee on Appropriations]]; during her tenure on the Appropriations Committee, she fought for increased funding to aid local jurisdictions to comply with desegregation mandates <ref name=\"SlimPast\"/>\n\nIn 1973, with the birth of her daughter Autumn, Burke became the first Congresswoman to give birth while in office and the first to be granted maternity leave by the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"SlimPast\"/> She did not seek re-election to Congress in 1978 but instead ran for [[Attorney General of California]]. She won the Democratic nomination over [[Los Angeles City Attorney]] [[Burt Pines]] but was defeated in the general election by Republican State Senator [[George Deukmejian]].\n\n==California political involvement==\nIn 1979, shortly after leaving Congress, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] appointed her to the Board of [[Regents of the University of California]]; but she resigned later that year when Governor Brown appointed her to fill a vacancy on the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. Burke was the first female and first African-American supervisor. Her district, however, was largely made up of affluent, conservative white areas on the coast. In 1980, Burke was defeated in her bid for a full term in the seat by Republican Deane Dana. In 1982, Brown again appointed her to the Regents.\n\nIn 1992, Burke ran for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. After a hard-fought campaign that often turned negative, Burke defeated State Senator [[Diane Watson]].\n\nIn 2007, she announced that she would retire when her term expired in 2008. On July 27, 2007, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a front-page story revealing Burke was not living in the mostly low-income district she represented, but rather in the wealthy [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood neighborhood]], an apparent violation of state law.<ref>Leonard, Jack, and Lait, Matt.

Carson was the first woman and first [[African American]] to represent the 7th District. She was also the second African American woman elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]] from [[Indiana]], after [[Katie Hall]].\n\n==Life and political career==\nCarson was born in Louisville, Kentucky. The daughter of Velma V. Porter, she moved to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] while still a girl and worked in various positions to support her family. She graduated from [[Crispus Attucks High School]] in 1955 in Indianapolis.<ref name=is>{{cite news |first=Rob|last=Schneider|title= Carson remembered: Congresswoman gave voice to disadvantaged|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071216/SPECIAL21/712160384 |work= [[Indianapolis Star]] |publisher= |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=December 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071219114344/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071216/SPECIAL21/712160384 |archivedate = December 19, 2007}}</ref> She then attended [[Martin University]] in Indianapolis and [[Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis]]. She was a member of [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority.\n\nIn 1965, while working as a secretary at [[United Auto Workers|UAW]] Local 550, she was hired away by newly elected congressman [[Andrew Jacobs, Jr.|Andrew Jacobs]] to do casework in his Indianapolis office. When his own electoral prospects looked dim in 1972, he encouraged Carson to run for the [[Indiana House of Representatives]], which she did; she was elected in 1972, serving as a member for four years. In 1976, she successfully ran for the [[Indiana Senate]], where she served for 14 years.\n\nIn 1990 she was elected as a trustee for [[Center Township, Marion County, Indiana|Center Township]] (downtown Indianapolis), and was responsible for running [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] in central Indianapolis. Carson served six years as a trustee, creating a $6 million [[Economic surplus|surplus]] from the office's $20 million debt.<ref name='cancer'>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/25/carson.cancer/ | title=Congresswoman has terminal cancer | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=November 25, 2007}}</ref> Jacobs has said Carson \"not only took cheats off the welfare rolls, she [[lawsuit|sued]] them to get the money\". When Jacobs retired in 1996, Carson ran as his replacement in what was then the 10th District, and won [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] endorsement despite being heavily outspent by party chairman Ann DeLaney, 49 percent to 31 percent.\n\nIn the general election she faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Virginia Murphy Blankenbaker]], a state senator and stockbroker who, like Carson, was a grandmother with [[Liberalism|liberal]] views on [[abortion]] and the [[death penalty]]. Each raised a similar sum of money, but Carson won 53 percent that November.\n\n==House record==\nCarson had a reputation for being somewhat unpredictable, including votes for [[anti-terrorism]] bills and normal [[trade]] relations with [[China]]. Carson opposed the [[Iraq war]] resolution in 2002.\n\nCarson's legislative record included leading Congress to pass a House measure awarding [[Rosa Parks]] the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]; cosponsoring, with Sen. [[Richard Lugar]], the removal of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] bottlenecks on child [[health insurance]]; and the commemoration of the life and accomplishments of author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] (H.RES.324<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.RES.324:|title=Honoring the life and accomplishments of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. and extending the condolences of the House of Representatives to his family on the occasion of his death.

She was a co-sponsor of the Equal Employment Non-Discrimination Act and a member of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Equality Caucus in the U.S. House led by U.S. Representative [[Barney Frank]], D-Massachusetts.\n\nCarson was reelected with little difficulty in 1998 and 2000. Her 2000 campaign attracted a personal appearance by President [[Bill Clinton]] that drew thousands to the Indiana State Fairgrounds. In 2006, she traveled from Washington, D.C. to Indianapolis aboard [[Air Force One]] with President [[George W. Bush]] to appear at Indiana Black Expo.\n\nHer poor health and physical struggles led to tighter-than-expected races afterward.  In the 2002 election, her district was renumbered as the 7th District after Indiana lost a Congressional district after the 2000 [[census]], and was made slightly more Republican than its predecessor. Carson faced public affairs specialist Brose McVey. In a heated campaign that led to Carson leaving the stage in protest in their final pre-election debate, she won re-election 53 percent to 44 percent. She was re-elected by just over 11 points in 2004 defeating Republican Andrew Horning and Libertarian Barry Campbell.\n\nCarson defeated [[Eric Dickerson (politician)|Eric Dickerson]] in the [[Indiana's 7th congressional district election, 2006|2006 elections]] 54 percent to 46 percent, a narrow 8-point margin in a year when most incumbent Democrats skated to victory.<ref name='election'>{{cite web | url=http://www.in.gov/apps/sos/election/general/general2006;jsessionid=a3SUQAAWNALg?page=office&countyID=-1&officeID=5&districtID=-1 | title=Indiana General Election November 7, 2007 | publisher=[[Todd Rokita|Secretary of State of Indiana]] | date=November 6, 2007}}</ref>  In the same election, Democratic challengers toppled Republican incumbents in three Indiana districts much more conservative than Carson's.\n\nCarson was a member of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]].\n\nShe was one of the 31 who voted in the House not to count the [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].<ref name='clerk'>{{cite web | url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml | title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 7 | publisher=[[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives|Office of the Clerk]] | date=January 6, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nOn September 29, 2007, the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'' reported that Carson had been an in-patient at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis for the preceding eight days.<ref name='leave'>{{cite web | url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070929/LOCAL19/309290003/-1/RSS | title=Carson hospitalized with leg infection | author=Maureen Groppe | publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]] | date=September 29, 2007}}</ref> She was being treated for an infection in her leg near the area where a vein was removed in 1996 during double bypass heart surgery.

When  Representative Walter Jones, Sr., announced his retirement in 1992, Clayton  entered the Democratic primary to fill his seat. http://history.house.gov/People/Detail?id=11065. http://history.house.gov/People/Detail?id=11065.  Recently reapportioned by the  state legislature, the congressional district was one of two in North Carolina that had  a black majority In 1992.  Clayton and [[Mel Watt]] became the first [[African American]]s to win election to the House from North Carolina since 1898. (As Clayton won a special election, she took office before Watt). [[North Carolina's 12th congressional district|Watt's 12th congressional district]] was one of two minority majority districts developed in the 1990s, in order to give the substantial minority of African Americans in the state the ability to elect candidates of their choice, in compliance with the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref>\n[http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/departments/scr/redist/redsum/NCSUM.HTM senate.leg.state.mn.us \"North Carolina Redistricting Cases: the 1990s\"], National Conference of State Legislatures</ref> \n\nClayton gained national attention as president of her Democratic freshman class in Congress.

Her interests include prisoner rights; she co-founded [[Critical Resistance]], an organization working to abolish the [[prison-industrial complex]].

Her membership in the Communist Party led to [[Ronald Reagan]]'s request in 1969 to have her barred from teaching at any university in the State of California.

Tuggle School, a segregated black elementary school; later she attended Parker Annex, a [[middle-school]] branch of [[A. H. Parker High School|Parker High School]] in Birmingham. During this time Davis' mother, Sallye Bell Davis, was a national officer and leading organizer of the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], an organization influenced by the [[Communist Party]], which was trying to build alliances among African Americans in the South. Consequently, Davis grew up surrounded by communist organizers and thinkers who significantly influenced her intellectual development.<ref name=\"Interview-Angela Davis\">{{cite journal|last=Kum-Kum Bhavnani|first=Bhavnani|author2=Davis,Angela|title=Complexity, Activism, Optimism: An Interview with Angela Y.

She encountered the [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] at a rally during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and became his student. In a 2007 television interview, she said, \"Herbert Marcuse taught me that it was possible to be an academic, an activist, a scholar, and a revolutionary.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2007/aug/23/bourgeois-marxist|title=The Bourgeois Marxist|author=Barbarella Fokos|publisher=sandiegoreader.com|date=August 23, 2007|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}</ref> She worked part-time to earn enough money to travel to France and Switzerland before she attended the eighth [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in [[Helsinki, Finland]].

Davis was accepted by the [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Junior Year in France Program. Classes were initially at [[Biarritz]] and later at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In Paris, she and other students lived with a French family. She was in Biarritz when she learned of the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham church bombing]], committed by a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], in which four girls were killed. She was deeply grieved as she was personally acquainted with the young victims.<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\nNearing completion of her degree in French, Davis realized her major interest was in philosophy instead. She became particularly interested in the ideas of Herbert Marcuse and, on her return to Brandeis, she sat in on his course. Marcuse, she wrote, turned out to be approachable and helpful. She began making plans to attend the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] for [[Graduate school|graduate work]] in philosophy. In 1965 she graduated [[magna cum laude]], a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=\"Waters\"/>\n\n===University of Frankfurt===\nIn Germany, with a stipend of $100 a month, she first lived with a German family.

Many of her roommates were active in the radical [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union (SDS)]], and Davis participated in some SDS actions.

A principal focus of her current activism is the state of prisons within the United States.

According to Davis, between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century, the number of prisons in the United States sharply increased but crime rates continued to rise. During this time, the racism in American society is demonstrated by the disproportionate share of the African-American population who are incarcerated. \"What is effective or just about this \"justice\" system?\" she urged people to question.<ref name=\"Prison Abolishment\">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Are prisons Obsolete?|year=2003|publisher=Open Media Series|location=Canada}}</ref>\n\nDavis has lectured at [[Rutgers University]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Smith College]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Brown University]], [[Syracuse University]], and other schools.

She expressed her opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], racism, sexism, and the prison-industrial complex, and her support of gay rights and other social justice movements. In 1969, she blamed [[imperialism]] for the troubles suffered by oppressed populations. \n<blockquote>\"We are facing a common enemy and that enemy is Yankee Imperialism, which is killing us both here and abroad. Now I think anyone who would try to separate those struggles, anyone who would say that in order to consolidate an anti-war movement, we have to leave all of these other outlying issues out of the picture, is playing right into the hands of the enemy\", she declared.<ref name=Speech-Vietnam>{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Speech by Angela Davis at a Black Panther Rally in Bobby Hutton Park|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/04/15/18589458.php|work=East Bay|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>More than a generation later, in 2001 she publicly spoke against the war on terror following the [[9/11 attacks]], continued to criticize the prison-industrial complex, and discussed the broken immigration system. She said that if people wanted to solve social justice issues, they had to \"hone their critical skills, develop them and implement them.\" Later, in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, she declared that the \"horrendous situation in New Orleans\" was due to the structures of racism, capitalism, and imperialism with which our leaders ran this country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JKENb33U4E|work=YouTube|title=Angela Davis making a live public speech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDavis opposed the 1995 [[Million Man March]], arguing that the exclusion of women from this event necessarily promoted [[male chauvinism]].

Her second term expired at the end of 2005.\n\n== Early life and education==\nClara Virginia Clark was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. She received a [[B.A.]] in sociology from [[Knoxville College]] in [[Tennessee]] in 1967 and an [[M.S.W.]] from [[Indiana University Bloomington]] in 1969. She married Henry Fields in 1971; they divorced in 1985.<ref name=\"NYTimes 2005\"/>\n\nIn 1971, she moved to [[New York]] and became a social worker. In the late 1970s and 1980s she worked in a variety of administrative positions in the social services field, while also becoming involved in community politics.\n\nFields is well known for her activism during the height of the [[civil rights movement]] in which she participated in a number of protests and marches, thus beginning her foray into social and political advocacy.\n\nFields is a member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] sorority, and the [[Links Incorporated]].\n\n==Political offices==\nIn 1989, Fields was elected to the New York City Council.  In 1997, Fields was elected Manhattan Borough President, replacing [[Ruth Messinger]] who ran for Mayor, unsuccessfully, against [[Rudy Giuliani]].  Fields received acclaim for her support of cultural organizations such as the New York Shakespeare Festival and the West Side Arts Coalition. She was in office during the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks.\n\nSome community groups throughout Manhattan, however, have a low opinion of Ms. Fields' record. They argue that she would not listen to community concerns regarding the noisy nightclubs and promoted outsized and ill-advised development projects.  In 1999, Fields supported using eminent domain to seize a family-owned manufacturing plant in Harlem to be replaced by a [[Costco]] store.\n\nIn 2005, Fields was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate for mayor of [[New York City]].  In early polls, she placed second to [[Fernando Ferrer]].  She suffered criticism for her campaign's perceived lack of policy-based motivation, with some critics pointing to the term limits of her position at the time as the real impetus for her campaign.  A small scandal emerged when it was discovered that her campaign literature included photographs doctored to create the impression of diversity in support.  Fields never found traction and in the primary she finished third with 15.92% of the vote.<ref>http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/pdf/results/2005/primary/P2005NewYorkDem.pdf</ref> Fields finished behind former Bronx Borough President [[Fernando Ferrer]] and Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]], but ahead of City Council Speaker [[Gifford Miller]].\n\nIn March 2006 it was reported that Fields would run for the [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] seat representing Harlem and parts of Upper Manhattan, being vacated by Senate Minority Leader [[David Paterson]].  Paterson decided not to seek reelection to the Senate seat in order to run for [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|lieutenant governor]] on a ticket with State Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]]. On June 1, 2006, Fields announced that she was ending her Senate campaign, explaining that now was not the right time for her to run.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Government of New York City]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"NYTimes 2005\">{{cite news\n |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E2D9113EF930A1575BC0A9639C8B63\n|title= Bringing Faith and Conciliation To a Mayoral Bid in New York\n |first= Randal C. |last= Archibold\n |date= August 23, 2005\n |accessdate= March 1, 2011\n |work=The New York Times\n }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box\n |title= [[New York City Council|New York City Council, 5th District]]\n |years= 1990&ndash;1992\n |before= [[Hilton Clark]]\n |after= [[Charles E.F.

In 1996, after she argued on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour]]'' that illegal immigration was responsible for the low quality of Los Angeles schools, some of her colleagues at the school condemned her in an open letter. Two days later, she attended an anti-illegal-immigration rally where several of her supporters were attacked by members of the [[Progressive Labor Party (USA)|Progressive Labor Party]], who allegedly wanted to harm Foster herself. Shortly thereafter, she left her job, which she calls a necessity resulting from her treatment at work.

She was 2007/08 President of the [[National Conference of Democratic Mayors]].\n\nIn 2008, facing a major deficit, Mayor Franklin asked the Atlanta City Council to approve a property tax increase, to avoid public safety cuts. The Atlanta City Council unanimously shot down the measure, which would have caused the average city homeowner to pay an estimated extra $30 in property taxes under Franklin\u2019s plan. As Mayor Franklin warned, without the tax increase, layoffs and pay cuts of Atlanta public safety officials would be imminent.\n\nAccording to the [[Atlanta Journal Constitution]], in December 2008 Franklin announced that 222 city workers would lose their jobs to help fill a projected $50 million to $60 million budget shortfall. Most remaining city workers, including firefighters, will work fewer hours and suffer a pay cut as part of the budget cuts.\n\nMayor Shirley Franklin has said that the deficits in the city of Atlanta are not because of excess city spending. In fact, according to the Atlanta Business Chronicle city spending actually ran slightly below budgeted amounts through the first quarter of the fiscal year that began in July. According to Mayor Shirley Franklin, city tax collections are down by more than 12 percent because of the economic downturn. However, basic accounting mistakes in the city budget also played a significant role in the budget crisis. An independent audit of the 2002 budget by Ernst & Young reported that Atlanta had some of the worst bookkeeping practices the auditors had ever seen and that many finance department employees were clearly unqualified for their jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=489552|title=The chinks in Shirley's armor|date=May 28, 2008|author=Scott Henry|accessdate=November 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\nMayor Shirley Franklin has also asked Congress for a \"bail-out\" of over $30 million for the city of [[Atlanta]].\n\nFranklin, [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Michael Nutter]] and [[Phil Gordon (politician)|Phil Gordon]] of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] lobbied Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] in a joint letter asking for a share of the proposed $700 billion bailout.\n\n==Honors==\n\nMayor Franklin was the recipient of [[Profile in Courage Award]] in 2005, issued by the [[John F.

She graduated in 1971, and went on to earn a master's degree from [[Columbia University]]'s [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]] In the late 1970s, she earned a PhD in developmental psychology from the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY). Fulani was a guest researcher at Rockefeller University from 1973\u20131977, with a focus on how learning and social environment interact for African-American youth.\n\nWhile in college, she became involved in [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] politics, along with her then-husband Richard.

During her studies at City University, Fulani became interested in the work of [[Fred Newman (philosopher)|Fred Newman]] and [[Lois Holzman]], who had recently formed the [[New York Institute for Social Therapy and Research]]. Fulani studied at the Institute in the early 1980s.\n\n==Electoral politics==\n\nFulani became active in the Newman-founded independent [[New Alliance Party]] (NAP) and emerged as a spokesperson who often provoked controversy. In 1982 Fulani ran for Lt. Governor of New York on the NAP ticket but was unsuccessful. She has also been involved in the affiliated (or some say, secret) [[Independent Workers Party]], the Rainbow Alliance, and other shifting groups led by Newman.{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\nShe helped recruit the NAP's 1984 presidential candidate [[Dennis L.

Later, Fulani unsuccessfully sought the Vice Presidential nomination at the national convention organized by a faction of the Reform Party.{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn the 2001 [[Election results for mayor of New York|election]] for [[List of mayors of New York City|Mayor of New York City]], Fulani endorsed the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Michael Bloomberg]] and organized city members of the IP to work for his campaign.

In 1984, she helped found the Castillo Cultural Center in New York City, which produces mostly plays written by Newman, in an unusual arrangement. In 1998, the Castillo Center merged with the All Stars Project youth charity and broadened the single base for Newman's work. Fulani has been active in the development of educational programs associated with the All Stars Project,<ref>http://allstars.org</ref> including the Joseph A. Forgione Development School for Youth and the All Stars Talent Show Network, which create enriching experiences outside school for poor inner city youth, using a performance model.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Derrick Bell. ''Silent Covenants: Brown V. Board of Education and the Unfulfilled Hopes for Racial Reform''Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> Fulani described her approach in [[Derrick Bell]]'s 2004 book ''Silent Covenants: Brown V. Board of Education and the Unfulfilled Hopes for Racial Reform'':\n<blockquote>We teach young people to use performance skills to become more cosmopolitan and sophisticated\u2014to interact with the worlds of Wall Street, with business and the arts. In becoming more cosmopolitan\u2014 in going beyond their narrow and parochial and largely nationalistic identities\u2014they acquire a motivation to learn as a part of consistently creating and recreating their lives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 2004 the [[Anti-Defamation League]] criticized the All Stars/Castillo theater troupe for its play ''Crown Heights'', accusing the playwright of blaming the riots on the Jewish community.<ref>[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/BkJew_21/4446_21.htm \"ADL Says 'Crown Heights' Distorts History and Refuels Hatred\"].

In addition, [[Political Research Associates]] published a critical report on the NAP in 1987, and updated and revised it in 2008 on their website www.PublicEye.org.\n\nAfter working with Fulani for several years, Serrette, who also had a personal relationship with her, has questioned his experience and publicly criticized Newman and Fulani's leadership of the party and its members. \"[I]t was clearly a tactical ...a [[racism|racist]] scheme of using Black and Latino and [[Asian people]] to do the bidding of one man, namely Fred Newman, that's my opinion, and to use other whites as well, you know through the therapy practices.\"<ref>[http://www.observer.com/node/42305 George Gurley, \"Guru Fred Newman Enchants Loyal Followers and Pat Buchanan\"]''The New York Observer'', December 6, 1999</ref>\n\nAfter he raised his concerns internally, Serrette said his treatment by other NAP leaders worsened dramatically. He also questioned the way in which therapy was used in the political work: \"...[T]herapy was a way of getting people to not only operate in an organizational way, but also a way of controlling every aspect of their lives...you certainly couldn't straighten anybody out. But it was certainly effective in terms of controlling a lot of people to do the kinds of things that were asked of them...they would do anything, just about, that he would ask them to do.\"<ref>Chip Berlet, ''Clouds Blur the Rainbow: The Other Side of the New Alliance Party'', Cambridge: Political Research Associates, 1987 [http://www.publiceye.org/newman/nap1.html]</ref>\n\nIn an article published after he left the NAP, Serrette stated:\n<blockquote>\"I knew when I joined NAP that it was not black-led, and I knew when I left it was not black-led.  It took longer to understand that NAP was not even a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] organization as it also pretends.\n\nBe that as it may, I probably still would not take the time to write about the organization.  However, as a long-time activist who made the mistake of joining NAP, and who served on the organization's \"Central Committee,\" I believe I have a responsibility to reveal the intense psychological control and millions of dollars Fred Newman employs to get well-meaning individuals in our communities (they target the black community), to viciously attack black leaders, black institutions, and progressive organizations for purposes of building Newman's power base.\"</blockquote><ref name=\"publiceye.org\"/>\n\nFulani dismissed his charges as related simply to the end of their personal relationship. In her self-published autobiography ''The Making of a Fringe Candidate, 1992'' (1992), Fulani wrote that Serrette frequently fought with black women in the New Alliance Party and would \"criticize and ridicule\" them for their relationship to Newman.<ref>Lenora B.

She sits on the House committees of  Appropriations, Calendars, and State Affairs, of which she is the vice chairman. She previously served on the House Select Committee on Public Education, the House Select Committee on Contested Elections, and the House Committee on Financial Institutions.\n\nGiddings attended the [[University of Texas at Arlington]]. She is the founder and president of Multiplex, Inc. A former board chairman of the Dallas Black Chamber of Commerce, in the 1980s, as Vice-Chair of the Dallas Transit Board, her mediation skills were employed to end a bus driver strike.\n\nShe has focused much of her time and energy on providing equal educational opportunities for children. In 1997, she authored the legislation establishing the \"Read to Succeed Program\" which included then [[governor of Texas|Governor]] [[George W. Bush]]'s reading initiative. The program enables Texas drivers' to order a special license plate, and the proceeds provide financial support to the Texas school library of the driver's choice. The \"Read to Succeed\" license plate is the first Texas license plate designed by a child. She authored legislation that prohibits five-year-olds being placed in alternative education. In 1995, Giddings authored legislation to prohibit alcohol-related businesses near schools.\n\nShe successfully authored legislation on dyslexia and other learning disabilities as well as programs which address adult education. In higher education, she has led efforts to eliminate geographic and ethnic disparities in funding. Her endeavors have led to more equitable funding for institutions of higher learning in the Metroplex. To provide equal opportunities for minorities and rural students, in 1997 Giddings joint authored the Top 10% rule. During the 79th Legislature as the Business and Industry chair, she joint authored legislation creating the new Worker's Compensation system as well as authoring five bills focusing on Identity Theft Prevention, Punishment of Criminals, and Help for Victims of Identity Theft. In 2003, Giddings authored the 900-page Business Organization Code. As a proponent for justice, Giddings authored legislation to create an unsolved crimes unit within the Texas Rangers agency.\n\nIn 2001, she created and passed groundbreaking legislation which requires that every child in Texas receive a course in CPR once in their high school career. The Texas Affiliate of the American Heart Association awarded her the \"Heart of Honor\" for her work and pledged $1.5 million in materials and funding toward the measure. She has served as President of the [[National Foundation of Women Legislators]], the first woman of color and the first Texan to be elected as president of the NFWL. She is an active member of the Women's Legislative Network of the National Conference of State Legislators. She was named to the Texas Association of Realtors 2001 Legislative Honor Roll, and by the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' as a \"Rising Star\" of the Texas Legislature.\n\nShe has worked to improve trade and cultural relations between South Africa and the United States. During her many trips to South Africa, she has received awards and recognition from former President [[Nelson Mandela]] and served on the Texas Host Committee for the visit of President, [[Thabo Mbeki]]. As a tribute to the outstanding work that Helen has done in South Africa, Prairie View A&M University has established the Helen Giddings Scholarships for Exemplary Students from South Africa, which are Presidential level scholarships.\n\nIn 2003, Texas Democrats from the state House and Senate made national headlines when they travelled across the state border to [[Oklahoma]] and [[New Mexico]], respectively, en masse to deny a [[quorum]] for voting on a redistricting plan. The State of Texas ordered a political police [[dragnet (policing)|dragnet]] across the Federal Interstate Highways of Texas in an attempt to stop Democratic legislators from reaching sanctuary in another state or inside of Texas on property solely operated by the US Federal Government like [[Big Bend National Park]] on the [[Rio Grande]]. Big Bend National Park agreed to give sanctuary to legislators if they could get to the park. But the [[Federal Highway Administration]] repeatedly refused safe passage, and offered to cooperate with the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in arresting the legislators on the Federal Interstate Highways of Texas. Giddings was captured and driven to the capitol against her will. Then [[Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Tom Craddick]] apologized for ordering the Texas Rangers to arrest Giddings in May 2003 and then ordered the House sergeant at arms to incarcerate her in the state capitol buildings.\n\nIn 2013, Giddings voted against two key measures to restrict [[abortion]]. One halts the practice after twenty weeks of [[gestation]]. The other requires stricter health, safety, and sanitary regulations in abortion facilities. She did not vote on some dozen other issues brought before the House in 2013.{{Why?|date=September 2015}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/5506/helen-giddings|title=Helen Giddings' Voting Records|publisher=votesmart.org|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> \n\nGiddings was re-nominated in the Democratic primary held on March 4, 2014.

Black people who registered to vote in the South faced serious hardships at that time due to institutionalized [[racism]], including harassment, loss of their jobs, beatings, and [[lynching]]s; nonetheless, Hamer was the first volunteer.

Hamer was elected Vice-Chair.\n\nThe Freedom Democrats' efforts drew national attention to the plight of blacks in Mississippi, and represented a challenge to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who was seeking the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party's]] nomination for reelection; their success would mean that other Southern delegations, who were already leaning toward [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challenger [[Barry Goldwater]], would publicly break from the convention's decision to nominate Johnson&nbsp;\u2014 meaning in turn that he would almost certainly lose those states' [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral votes]]. Hamer, singing her signature hymns, drew a great deal of attention from the media, enraging Johnson, who referred to her in speaking to his advisors as \"that illiterate woman\".\n\nHamer was invited, along with the rest of the MFDP officers, to address the Convention's Credentials Committee. She recounted the problems she had encountered in registration, and the ordeal of the jail in Winona. Near tears, she concluded:\n\n<blockquote>\n{{cquote|''All of this is on account we want to register'' <nowiki>[</nowiki>sic<nowiki>]</nowiki>, ''to become first-class citizens, and if the Freedom Democratic Party is not seated now, I question America. Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily because we want to live as decent human beings&nbsp;\u2014 in America?'' <small>\u2014Fannie Lou Hamer</small><ref name=\"huff\">{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/is-this-america-rememberi_b_5715135.html | title=\"I Question America\" -- Remembering Fannie Lou Hamer's Famous Speech 50 Years Ago | work=Huffington Post | date=26 August 2014 | accessdate=3 March 2015 | author=Dreier, Peter}}</ref>}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn [[Washington, D.C.]], President Johnson, fearful of the power of Hamer's testimony on live television, called an emergency press conference in an effort to divert press coverage.<ref name=\"mcall\">{{cite news | url=http://www.mcall.com/opinion/yourview/mc-fannie-lou-hamer-speech-mayer-yv--20140821-story.html | title=Robert H.

Instead, to the bemusement of journalists, he arbitrarily announced the nine-month anniversary of the shooting of Texas governor, [[John Connally]], during the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/freedomsummer-transcript/ Transcript: \"Freedom Summer\"]: ''American Experience''. PBS, 2014-06-24.</ref> However, many [[television network]]s ran Hamer's speech unedited on their late news programs. The Credentials Committee received thousands of calls and letters in support of the Freedom Democrats.\n\nJohnson then dispatched several trusted Democratic Party operatives to attempt to negotiate with the Freedom Democrats, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] (who was campaigning for the [[Vice-President of the United States|Vice-Presidential]] nomination), [[Walter Mondale]], and [[Walter Reuther]], as well as [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. They suggested a compromise which would give the MFDP two non-voting seats in exchange for other concessions, and secured the endorsement of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] for the plan. But when Humphrey outlined the compromise, saying that his position on the ticket was at stake, Hamer, invoking her Christian beliefs, sharply rebuked him:\n\n<blockquote>\n{{cquote|''Do you mean to tell me that your position is more important than four hundred thousand black people's lives? Senator Humphrey, I know lots of people in Mississippi who have lost their jobs trying to register to vote. I had to leave the plantation where I worked in Sunflower County, Mississippi.

But if you take <nowiki>[</nowiki>the nomination<nowiki>]</nowiki> this way, why, you will never be able to do any good for civil rights, for poor people, for peace, or any of those things you talk about.

The MFDP rejected the compromise, with Hamer making the famous quote:\n<blockquote>\n{{cquote|''We didn't come all the way up here to compromise for no more than we\u2019d gotten here.

Soon after his victory, President Johnson appointed her Ambassador to Luxembourg from 1965 to 1967. She was the first African American woman named as an American envoy.

A testimony to her effectiveness and her commitment to excellence came when President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed her to two cabinet-level posts during his administration.\n\nHarris was appointed to the [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]] of President Jimmy Carter when he took office in 1977.  She thus became the first African American woman to enter the Presidential line of succession, at number 13.

Harris remained as Secretary of the renamed [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] until Carter left office in 1981.

That year, she was appointed a full-time professor at the George Washington National Law Center, a position she served in until her death from [[breast cancer]], on March 23, 1985.

Her particular concerns as a Senator included health care, education, [[public housing]], racial equity, [[economic development]], and job expansion. She served on the Finance Committee, for which she chaired the subcommittee on Health and Human Services, and on the Education Committee. Her interest in health care led her to write legislation to regulate diagnostic radiology centers, require drug testing in hospitals, prohibit discrimination against [[AIDS]] victims, improve access to health care for AIDS patients, and prohibit hospital kickbacks to doctors. As a [[Housing discrimination (United States)|fair housing]] advocate, she sponsored a bill to empower city governments to repair substandard housing at the expense of landlords, and wrote a bill to enforce prohibitions against housing discrimination.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fair housing bill proposed|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w5M9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=6TUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6922,6217253&dq=eddie-bernice-johnson+fair+housing&hl=en|newspaper=The Bonham Daily Favorite|date=December 22, 1988}}</ref>\n\nAs a lawmaker, Johnson was able to bring to a public forum her fight against racism, though she faced discrimination herself in the legislature. \"Being a woman and being black is perhaps a double handicap,\" she told the ''Chicago Tribune''. \"When you see who's in the important huddles, who's making the important decisions, it's men.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Korosec|first=Thomas|title=Eyes On Texas: Where Men Are Men And Women Run For Public Office|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-08-19/features/9003090294_1_lone-star-state-texans-men-and-women/2|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 19, 1990}}</ref> Johnson sponsored several bills aimed towards equity, including a bill to establish goals for the state to do business with 'socially-disadvantaged' businesses, and crafted a fair housing act aimed at toughening up fair housing laws and establishing a commission to investigate complaints of [[housing discrimination (United States)|discriminatory housing practices]].\n\nIn addition to her legislation, Johnson held hearings and investigated complaints.

In 1992, she formally asked the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to investigate harassment of local black students. That same year, she held hearings to examine discrimination charges about unfair contracting bids for the government's [[Superconducting Super Collider]].

(For a detailed account of these elections, see [[Special election musical chairs]].)\n\n===AUMF opposition===\nLee gained national attention in 2001 as the only member of congress to vote \"No\" on the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF), stating that she voted no not because she opposed military action but because she believed the AUMF, as written, granted overly-broad powers to wage war to the president at a time when the facts regarding the situation were not yet clear. She \"warned her colleagues to be 'careful not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target.'\"<ref>Polner, Murray (2010-03-01) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/mar/01/00032/ Left Behind], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Lee explained, \"It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 events\u2014anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration.... The president has the constitutional authority to protect the nation from further attack, and he has mobilized the armed forces to do just that. The Congress should have waited for the facts to be presented and then acted with fuller knowledge of the consequences of our action.\"\n\nThis vote made nationwide news reports and brought about a large and extremely polarized response, with the volume of calls gridlocking the switchboard of her Capitol Hill office. Although it appears to have reflected the beliefs of the majority of her constituents, the majority of responses from elsewhere in the nation were angry and hostile, some referring to her as \"communist\" and \"traitor\". Many of the responses included death threats against her or her family to the point that the Capitol Police provided round-the-clock plainclothes bodyguards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/09/23/INLEE.DTL|title=Why I opposed the resolution to authorize force|work=SFGate|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> She was also criticized by politicians and in editorial pages of conservative-leaning newspapers, e.g. [[John Fund]]'s column in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=95001156|title=Opinion, Editorials, Columns, Op-Ed, Letters to the Editor, Commentary - Wall Street Journal - Wsj.com|publisher=Opinionjournal.com|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> She was awarded the Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize by the [[International Peace Bureau]] in 2002 for that vote.\n\nIn her speech, she quoted the Rev.

Majette''' (born May 18, 1955) is an [[United States|American]] politician from the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], she represented [[Georgia's 4th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 2003 to 2005.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Brooklyn]], she attended [[Yale University]] and completed a [[Juris Doctor]] degree at [[Duke University]] in 1979.  She began her legal career in North Carolina as a Legal Aid staff attorney and a clinical adjunct law professor at [[Wake Forest University]]. A resident of the [[Atlanta]] suburb of [[Stone Mountain, Georgia|Stone Mountain]] since 1983, Majette worked in private law practice before being named an administrative law judge at the Georgia state board of workers' compensation in 1992.  The following year, Georgia Governor [[Zell Miller]] appointed her judge of the State Court of [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]].  Majette held the judgeship for nine years.<ref>http://www.blackpast.org/aah/majette-denise-l-1955#sthash.dFSZa625.dpuf</ref>\n\nShe resigned from the judgeship in [[U.S. House election, 2002|2002]] to run for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in {{ushr|Georgia|4|}}, which is based in DeKalb County. In a major upset, she defeated 10-year [[incumbent]] [[Cynthia McKinney]] in the Democratic [[primary election|primary]]. McKinney had attracted controversy due to her comments after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] and her reported backing by Muslim-American groups which she had said was racial profiling. The primary was also influenced by crossover-Republicans, i.e. Republicans who used their ability to vote in a Democratic caucus in Georgia. Majette, who had never run in a partisan contest before, trounced the seemingly entrenched McKinney by a 58% to 42% margin. Majette's upset win was [[tantamount to election]] in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district.\n\nIn Congress, Majette's voting record was slightly more moderate than that of McKinney.  Nonetheless, she is considered fairly liberal by national Democratic standards.  Among other issues, she supports [[affirmative action]], [[Pro-choice|abortion rights]], and legal status for [[illegal immigrant]]s working in the U.S., while she opposes [[school voucher]]s and the [[death penalty]].<ref>[http://ontheissues.org/GA/Denise_Majette.htm On the Issues: Denise Majette]</ref>\n\n==Runs for higher office and later career==\nMajette would have likely been able to keep her congressional seat for as long as she wanted, given the 4th's heavy Democratic tilt (only the neighboring Atlanta-based 5th is considered more Democratic). However, after only one term, she decided to run for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Zell Miller]], who had been appointed to the seat in 2000 following the death of Republican [[Paul Coverdell]]. Miller's decision not to seek a full term in the Senate had caught the Georgia Democrats by surprise. Majette's announcement that she would seek to replace Miller also caught Democrats by surprise, as she was not on anyone's call list when Democrats began seeking a candidate to replace Miller. Further skepticism among Democrats about the viability of her candidacy surfaced when she announced that \"God\" had told her to run for the Senate.\n\nMajette finished first in the Democratic primary but was forced into a runoff against millionaire businessman Cliff Oxford, which she won. She received important endorsements from Senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[Debbie Stabenow]] of Michigan, along with many others in Washington who campaigned and raised money for Majette. Her Senate campaign slogan was \"I'll be nobody's Senator, but yours.\" Majette was the first [[African American]] and the first woman to be nominated for the U.S. Senate in Georgia.\n\nIn the general election, despite her vigorous attacks against her [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent, 6th District Congressman [[Johnny Isakson]], Majette was soundly defeated, losing by 18 points.\n\nA number of factors led to the severe defeat. Majette was badly under financed and had to spend valuable time and money in the runoff. In contrast, Isakson had won the Republican nomination by an unexpectedly large margin. Due to her late entry in the race, she had little time or chance to make up ground on Isakson. A proposed amendment to the Georgia Constitution banning [[same-sex marriage]]s (which Majette opposed) boosted Republican turnout significantly; it not only passed by a wide margin statewide, but carried in every county, even DeKalb. She got little help from the top of the ticket; [[John Kerry]] had effectively ceded Georgia to [[George W. Bush]] early in the presidential campaign.\n\nMcKinney regained her seat in the 2004 election. While McKinney had made no secret that she wanted her old seat back, it is not known whether Majette's decision to run for the Senate was related to a possible rematch against McKinney.\n\nSoon after leaving the House, Majette entered private law practice in Atlanta.  In March 2006, Majette announced her candidacy for state School Superintendent of Georgia. She defeated substitute teacher Carlotta Harrell in the primary, garnering 67% of the vote. In the general election, however, Majette lost to Republican incumbent [[Kathy Cox]] by a large margin.\n\nOn March 28, 2014, the Georgia Supreme Court disbarred Majette, finding she overbilled clients and misled the Court about how much she was owed in fees.<ref>[http://beta.mirror.augusta.com/news/crime-courts/2014-03-28/ex-congresswoman-disbarred?v=1396016365]</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n[[Image:RepDeniseMajette.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Congressional photo of Denise Majette.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ {{ushr|Georgia|4|}}: 2002 results<ref name=\"clerkresults\">{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |title=Election Statistics |accessdate=2007-08-08 |publisher=Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives }}</ref>\n!|Year\n!\n!|Democrat\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|Republican\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n|-\n|[[U.S. House election, 2002|2002]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |{{nowrap|'''Denise L.

Meek''' (n\u00e9e '''Pittman''';<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/meek.htm Kendrick Brett Meek], RootsWeb, Ancestry.com</ref> born April 29, 1926) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]]. She served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1993 to 2003, representing [[Florida's 17th congressional district]].\n\n==Background and early life==\nMeek, the granddaughter of slaves and daughter of former [[sharecroppers]], was born and raised in segregated [[Tallahassee, Florida]]. She graduated from [[Lincoln High Tigers of Florida|Lincoln High School]]. She remained in north Florida for college and graduated from [[Florida A&M University]] (then known as Florida A&M College for Negroes) in 1946. At this time, African Americans could not attend graduate school in Florida, so Meek enrolled in the [[University of Michigan]] and received her M.S. degree in 1948. After graduation, Meek was hired as a teacher at [[Bethune-Cookman University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], and then at her [[alma mater]], Florida A&M University. Meek moved to Miami in 1961 to serve as special assistant to the vice president of [[Miami-Dade Community College]]. The college was desegregated in 1963, largely due to Meek's integral role in the push for its integration. Throughout her years as an educator, Meek was also active in community projects in the Miami area.\n\n==Political career==\nMeek was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1978 as a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrat]], serving until 1983. As a state representative, she introduced a bill criminalizing [[stalking]]. In 1982, she was the first African American woman elected to the [[Florida State Senate]]. As a State Senator, Meek served on the Education Appropriations Subcommittee. Her efforts in the Legislature also led to the construction of thousands of affordable rental housing units.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nMeek was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1992, after fourteen years in the Florida Legislature. This made her the first black lawmaker elected to represent Florida in Congress since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Upon taking office, Meek faced the task of helping her district recover from [[Hurricane Andrew]]'s devastation. Her efforts helped to provide $100 million in federal assistance to rebuild [[Miami-Dade County]] (then known as Dade County). Also while in the House, Meek successfully focused her attention on issues such as economic development, health care, education and housing. She led legislation through Congress to improve Miami-Dade County's transit system, airport and seaport; construct a new family and childcare center in North Dade County; and fund advanced aviation training programs at Miami-Dade Community College. Meek emerged as a strong advocate for [[Haiti]]an immigrants and senior citizens.\n\nMeek claimed that her district \u2014 Florida's 17th Congressional district \u2014 was undercounted in the 1990 [[Census]]. She believed that her constituents were cheated in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential Election]]. Meek refused to attend a meeting with President [[George W. Bush]] in February 2001.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}} She retired from the House at the end of her term in 2003, and was succeeded by her son, [[Kendrick Meek]].\n\n==Honors and awards==\nMeek has received numerous awards and honors. She is the recipient of honorary doctor of laws degrees from the [[University of Miami]], [[Florida A&M University]], [[Barry University]], [[Florida Atlantic University]] and [[Rollins College]]. Meek was a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, in addition to serving on the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government and the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies.  The Carrie Meek - James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum located in Tallahassee, Florida on Florida A&M University's campus was co-named in her honor. She is a member of [[Delta Sigma Theta]] sorority. In 2001, she was interviewed by ''The HistoryMakers''.\n\n==Electoral history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ {{ushr|Florida|17|}}: Results 1992&ndash;2000<ref name=\"clerkresults\">{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/ |title=Election Statistics |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |publisher=Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives }}</ref>\n!|Year\n!\n!|Democrat\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n!|Republican\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!\n|-\n|[[U.S. House election, 1992|1992]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |{{nowrap|'''Carrie P.

An Assistant United States Attorney, she worked primarily in the civil and appellate law areas.  Her work in housing, health policy, and environmental law won her the Attorney General's Special Achievement Award.<ref>Simmonds, Yusef, [http://www.lasentinel.net/The-Senators.html \"The Senators: Carol Moseley Braun\"].

There, she rose to the post of assistant [[majority leader]]. As a State Representative, she became recognized as a champion for liberal social causes.<ref name=Nordgren/>  As early as 1984, she proposed a moratorium on the application in Illinois of the death penalty. And in what became a landmark reapportionment case, Crosby vs State Board of Elections, she successfully sued her own party and the state of Illinois on behalf of African-American and Hispanic citizens. When she left the state legislature in 1987, her colleagues recognized her in a resolution as \"the conscience of the House.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Carol Moseley-braun|url=http://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/carol-moseley-braun/|work=National Women's History Museum|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}</ref> That same year, she was elected as [[Cook County, Illinois]], [[Recorder of Deeds]], a post she held for four years.\n\n== U.S. Senate ==\n\n=== Elections ===\n[[Image:Carol Moseley Braun NZ.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Senator Moseley Braun]]\nIn 1991, angered by incumbent Democratic senator [[Alan Dixon]]'s vote to confirm [[Clarence Thomas]], Moseley Braun challenged him in the primary election. Candidate Albert Hofeld's campaign ran many anti-Dixon ads, and Moseley Braun won the Democratic primary. On November 3, 1992, she became the first African-American woman to be elected to the United States Senate, defeating Republican [[Richard S. Williamson]]. Her election marked the first time Illinois had elected a woman and the first time a black person was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate. She (along with Republican [[Edward Brooke]]) was one of two African Americans to serve in the Senate in the 20th century and was the sole African American in the Senate for her entire term. She was the first woman to serve on the Senate Finance Committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carol Moseley-Braun|url=http://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/carol-moseley-braun/|website=National Women's History Museum|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nCarol Moseley Braun was a one-term Senator, losing to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]] in her [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 1998|re-election bid in 1998]].\n\n[[Image:Yearofthewoman.jpg|thumb|right|Female Senators of the Democratic Party, 1993.

[[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA)]]\n\n=== Positions ===\nDespite her reputation as a [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]], Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. Moseley Braun voted in favor of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and lawsuit reform measures like the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more [[Populism|populist]] wing of the party by voting for the [[Freedom to Farm Act]] and the [[Telecommunications Act 1997|Telecommunications Act]] of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Paul Simon, she voted in favor of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially former [[Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]].\n\nOn social issues however, she was significantly more liberal than many of her fellow senators. She was strongly [[pro-choice]], voting against the ban on [[partial-birth abortions]] and the restrictions on funding in military bases for abortions. She also voted against the death penalty and in favor of [[gun control]] measures. Moseley Braun was one of only sixteen senators to vote against the [[Communications Decency Act]] and one of only fourteen to vote against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]. She delivered a eulogy to Thurgood Marshall on January 26, 1993.\n\nIn 1993, the Illinois Senator made headlines when she convinced the Senate Judiciary Committee not to renew a design patent for the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] because it contained the [[Confederate flag]]. The patent had been routinely renewed for nearly a century, and despite the Judiciary Committee\u2019s disapproval, the Senate was poised to pass a resolution sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina that included a provision to authorize the extension of the federal patent. Moseley Braun threatened to filibuster the legislation \u201cuntil this room freezes over.\u201d She also made a plea to her colleagues about the symbolism of the Confederate flag, declaring, \u201cIt has no place in our modern times, place in this body, place in our society.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|editor=John Clay Smith Jr.|title=Rebels in Law: Voices in History of Black Women Lawyers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qk05m1uiTDIC|accessdate=19 May 2016|year=2000|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-08646-4|pages=150\u2013156|chapter=The Confederate Flag as Racist Symbolism}}</ref> Swayed by Moseley Braun\u2019s argument, the Senate rejected the UDC\u2019s application to renew its patent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baic.house.gov/member-profiles/profile.html?intID=59 |title=Black Americans in Congress \u2013 Carol Moseley Braun, Senator from Illinois |publisher=Baic.house.gov |date= |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/us/daughter-of-slavery-hushes-senate.html |title=Daughter of Slavery Hushes Senate |author-link1=Adam Clymer | last1=Clymer | first1=Adam |date=July 23, 1993 |website=[[New York Times]] |access-date=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nMoseley Braun was the subject of a 1993 [[Federal Election Commission]] investigation over $249,000 in unaccounted-for campaign funds.

Her parents, Rachel Huggins and McCullough Alva Baker,<ref name=\"Hines\">Hines, C.D., Hines, C.W. & Harrow, S. (2011). The African American Odyssey.

A speech by Yale Law School graduate George Crawford, a civil rights attorney for the New Haven Branch of the NAACP, inspired Baker to attend law school.<ref name=Hines />\n\nWith financial help from a local philanthropist, Clarence W. Blakeslee, she started college at [[Fisk University]], a [[historically black college]] in Nashville, Tennessee, but later returned north to attend integrated [[New York University]].  At NYU, she obtained her Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1943. Motley received her law degree in 1946 from [[Columbia University School of Law]].<ref name=Hines />\n\nIn October 1945, during Baker's second year at Columbia's Law School, future U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] hired her as a law clerk. She was assigned to work on [[Court-martial|court martial]] cases that were filed after World War II.<ref name=Hines />\n\n==Civil rights work==\nAfter graduating from Columbia's Law School in 1946, Baker was hired by the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (LDF) as a civil rights lawyer.  As the fund's first female attorney, she became Associate Counsel to the LDF, making her a lead trial attorney in a number of early and significant civil rights cases.  Baker visited churches that were fire bombed, sang freedom songs, and visited Rev. [[Martin Luther King]] while he sat in jail, as well as spending a night with civil rights activist [[Medgar Evers]] under armed guard.<ref name=Douglas />\n\nIn 1950 she wrote the original complaint in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. The first African-American woman ever to argue a case before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], in ''[[Meredith v. Fair]]'' she won [[James Meredith]]'s effort to be the first black student to attend the [[University of Mississippi]] in 1962. Motley was successful in nine of the ten cases she argued before the Supreme Court. The tenth decision, regarding jury composition, was eventually overturned in her favor. She was otherwise a key legal strategist in the civil rights movement, helping to desegregate [[Southern United States|Southern]] schools, buses, and lunch counters.\n\n==Political and judicial firsts==\nMotley was elected on February 4, 1964, to the [[New York State Senate]] (21st district), to fill the vacancy caused by the election of [[James Lopez Watson]] to the [[New York City Civil Court]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E7D71038E13ABC4D53DFB466838F679EDE ''MRS.

From 1989 to 1993, she worked as an executive vice president of the [[Northern States Power Company]].\n\nIn 1993, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] nominated O'Leary as Secretary of Energy.

It was bequeathed to Fisk by his widow and fellow artist [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] on the condition that it never be sold. Fisk appealed to the Chancery Court to be released from the condition prohibiting sale. The court directed the [[State Attorney General]] to develop an alternative plan to keep the collection in Nashville and the state. In September 2010 Attorney General Bob D. Cooper proposed the collection be transferred to the Tennessee Arts Commission and housed at the [[Frist Center for the Visual Arts]] in Nashville. It would be identified as the \"Alfred Stieglitz Collection at Fisk University\". The proposal is a joint state, city and museum project.<ref>[http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100910/NEWS03/100910024/AG-unveils-plan-to-keep-Fisk-art-in-Nashville?

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], she represented part of the city's [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] in the [[Chicago City Council]]. As an Alderman, Tillman was a strong advocate of [[reparations for slavery]].  In April 2007, she was defeated in a runoff election by challenger [[Pat Dowell]]. Tillman defeated Dowell in 2003.  Prior to her career as an alderman, Tillman was active in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], working for [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King's]] [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) as an [[activist]]. Tillman was known for wearing large hats and has cultivated this image as her trademark [http://images.google.com/images?q=Dorothy+Tillman&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi}]\n\n==Civil rights activities==\nDorothy Tillman was born in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] in 1947. She joined the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) as a trainee and field staff organizer in 1963. Tillman marched with King and was among the SCLC Field Staff to cross the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]]  in [[Selma, Alabama]] in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] on 7 March 1965. She had her first involvement in Chicago politics later in 1965 when King sent her there to campaign for better housing, education and employment conditions for blacks. This campaign marked the start of King's effort to improve socio-economic conditions for blacks. Tillman was involved in organizing King's move into a Chicago tenement in early 1966 and the launch of his campaign in July 1966. While in Chicago, Tillman met her husband, blues drummer Jimmy Lee Tillman. The Tillmans moved to [[San Francisco]] shortly after their marriage and became involved in a successful campaign to improve public transport services to their neighborhood.\n\nThe Tillmans later returned to Chicago where Dorothy Tillman became involved in educational issues. She founded the Parent Equalizers of Chicago, which eventually became active in 300 schools across the city, setting the groundwork for school reform in Chicago. The momentum created by several successful grassroots campaigns Tillman help organize led to the election of Chicago\u2019s first [[African American]] mayor, [[Harold Washington]].\n\n==Chicago Aldermanic tenure==\nDorothy Tillman was elected as an alderman representing Chicago's Third Ward in 1985, being the first woman elected for that ward. Tillman pioneered the first TIF to be used in the black community, with the construction of the 55th and Dan Ryan shopping center. She helped to found the [[African American Home Builders Association]] and advocated for a 70/30 plan to make certain that African Americans received the majority of the contracts.In 2000, Tillman requested that two waiters at the Palmer House hotel in Chicago be replaced with African-American waiters for a banquet hosted by Alderman Tillman. Chicago mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] delivered a strongly worded rebuke in the media.<ref>Spielman, Fran: \"Daley blasts Tillman for waiter request\", 20 July 2001, Chicago Sun-Times, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4600854.html]</ref>\n\nTillman was an advocate of reparations for [[slavery]] and was successful in having a number of resolutions passed in support of the concept. She authored a bill, passed unanimously in 2002, forcing companies who perform contracts with the council to declare any past ties with slavery. In early 2005, Tillman led a campaign against a $500 million refinancing deal with the [[Bank of America]] because of its alleged links with slavery. In the case of the Bank of America, these links are allegedly through [[FleetBoston Financial]], a company which it acquired in 2004. Providene, a predecessor of Fleet Boston, was supposedly founded by a slave owner in 1791.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nDuring one loud session of the City Council, Tillman gained the attention of the entire floor when she produced a pistol from her handbag and brandished it about.<ref>Okpotor, Faith: \"Pistol packin\u2019 aldermen protected by the law\", http://www.chicagodefender.com/page/local.cfm?ArticleID=3863, [[Chicago Defender]], February 3, 2006</ref> This led calls by some aldermen and Chicago citizens to call for a censure on Tillman's professional ethics, and possible mandatory [[gun safety]] training.\"Tillman has been involved in the [[Harold Washington Cultural Center]] (HWCC) since its inception.

Daley|Richard Daley]], Tillman was not able to achieve a majority of votes in Chicago's non-partisan aldermanic election in February, 2007.  As a result, Tillman stood in a runoff election against challenger [[Pat Dowell]]. Dowell took 54 percent of the vote to 46 percent for Tillman.<ref>\"Union candidates surprise Daley-backed Tillman, Haithcock, Coleman,\" April 18, 2007 Chicago Sun-Times, p. 23.</ref> During a heated debate between Tillman and Dowell on April 3, 2007, Dowell charged Tillman with failing to produce business growth beyond the street corner where her ward office was located and stated \"I will be the change agent,\" after which Tillman's daughter (and political staffer) shouted out \"A white man agent!\"<ref>Dumke, Mick: \"Aldermania: The Final Round\", http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/aldermania/, Chicago Reader, April 13, 2007</ref> In October 2008 Tillman was convicted for criminal trespassing at an Alabama hospital in March 2008.

She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district is located entirely in [[Los Angeles County]] and includes much of [[Central Los Angeles]], as well as such wealthy neighborhoods as [[Los Feliz]].\n\nA native of [[Los Angeles]], Watson is a graduate of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and also holds degrees from [[California State University, Los Angeles]] and [[Claremont Graduate University]]. She worked as a psychologist, professor, and health occupation specialist before serving as a member of the [[Los Angeles Unified School District|Los Angeles Unified School Board]] (1975\u201378). She was a member of the [[California Senate]] from 1978 to 1998, and the [[United States Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia|US Ambassador to Micronesia]] from 1999 to 2000.\n\nWatson was elected to Congress in a 2001 special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Representative [[Julian C. Dixon]]. She was re-elected four times, but retired after the end of the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]].\n\n==Early life, education and career==\n[[File:Diane Watson.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Earlier photo of Watson]]\nBorn in [[Los Angeles, California]], Watson was raised Catholic.<ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=BS021500 Representative Diane E.

Watson became a member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]].\n\nShe earned an [[Master of Science|MS]] from [[California State University, Los Angeles]] in [[School Psychology]] (1967) and a [[PhD]] in [[School leadership|Educational Administration]] from [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1987. She also attended the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].  Watson taught [[elementary school]] and was a [[school psychologist]] in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District|Los Angeles public schools]].  She has lectured at [[California State University, Long Beach]] and [[California State University, Los Angeles]]. She was a health occupation specialist with the [[California Department of Education]]'s Bureau of Industrial Education.\n\nWatson was elected to the [[California State Senate]] from 1978 to 1998.  The longtime chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, she gained a reputation as an advocate for [[health care]] for the [[poverty|poor]] and [[child]]ren.  Term limited, she was replaced by [[Kevin Murray (politician)|Kevin Murray]].\n\nWhen, in 1988, the US government proposed the addition of the category of \"bi-racial\" or \"[[multiracial]]\" to official documents and statistics, some African American organizations and African American leaders such as Watson and Representative [[Augustus Hawkins]] were particularly vocal in their rejection and opposition of the category.  They feared massive defection from the [[African American]] self-designation.\n\nIn 1992, Watson ran for the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]].  After a hard-fought campaign that often turned negative, Watson narrowly lost to former Supervisor [[Yvonne Burke]], who was supported by US Representative [[Maxine Waters]].\n\nPresident [[Bill Clinton]] appointed her [[United States Ambassador]] to [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]] in 1999.\n\n==US House of Representatives==\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]]'''\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health|Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health]]\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment|Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment]]\n**[[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade|Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade]]\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]'''\n**[[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Domestic Policy|Subcommittee on Domestic Policy]]\n**[[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and Procurement|Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and Procurement]] (Chairwoman)\n**[[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives|Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives]]\n\n===Caucuses===\n*Chair of the Congressional Entertainment Industries Caucus\n*Co-chair of the Congressional Korea Caucus\n*Co-chair of the U.S.-UK Caucus\n*[[Congressional Black Caucus]]\n\nCongresswoman Watson supports [[withdrawal of US troops from Iraq]],<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_iraq.shtml War in Iraq: 2006]</ref> opposes [[media consolidation]],<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_media.shtml Corporate Media and the FCC]</ref>  supports expanding [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] coverage <ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_welfare.shtml High-Priced Republican Welfare Plan Puts the Burden on States]</ref> and opposed President Bush's proposal to [[privatize]] [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].<ref>[http://www.house.gov/watson/issues_socialsecurity.shtml How will President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security impact America and the 33rd District of California?]</ref>  Watson opposed the [[Bush tax cuts]], saying they were unaffordable.\n\nShe was one of the 31 members of the House who voted not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004]].<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 7]</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the ''[[National Journal]]'' ranked Watson as the most [[Social liberalism|liberal]] member of Congress.<ref>[http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=3655 National Journal - Composite Liberal Score]</ref>\n\nOn the issue of [[Cherokee Freedmen]] membership in the Cherokee tribe, Watson noted that 20,000 Cherokee lived in California.  She opposed the [[Cherokee Nation]]'s March 2007 vote to amend its [[constitution]] to limit membership to only those descendants with at least one [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] ancestor on the [[Dawes Roll]].  She noted that when [[freedmen]] were granted [[citizenship]] in the tribe in 1866 by a treaty which the Cherokees made with the US government, it was without restriction to those freedmen with Indian ancestry. Appeals to the Cherokee Nation's position were pending, in part because the tribe excluded descendants of Cherokee freedmen and intermarried whites from voting on the amendment.  In June 2007 Watson introduced a bill to sever US relations with the tribe and revoke its [[Native American gambling enterprises|gaming privileges]] unless the Cherokee restored membership in the tribe to descendants of Cherokee freedmen.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gillian |last=Flaccus |authorlink=<!-- Gillian Flaccus --> |author= |coauthors= |title=Cherokee identity fight reaches Calif. |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/09/27/cherokee_identity_fight_reaches_calif/ |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Boston Globe |location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]] |id= |pages= |page= |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-28 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090903120550/http://www.boston.com:80/news/nation/articles/2007/09/27/cherokee_identity_fight_reaches_calif/ |archivedate=September 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Political campaigns==\nIn the [[2008 Democratic primary]], Watson's district went overwhelmingly for [[Illinois]] Senator [[Barack Obama]] by a margin of 61-29.

Johnson]], and was the first [[African-American]] secretary in the [[White House]].\n\nJohnson was famous for working long hours and insisting his assistants worked long hours as well. When [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy was assassinated]] and Johnson became president, he requested a new slate of secretaries. He saw Whittington working in a government office, and requested that his \"special assistant\" [[Jack Valenti]] get her home phone number. Johnson called her unannounced one evening, and requested that she come in that night for an interview. According to audiotapes of Johnson's phone calls, Whittington at first thought the call was a joke, but came to believe that it really was the president on the line.<ref>Jon Margolis, ''The Last Innocent Year: America in 1964: The Beginning of the \"Sixties\"''; New York: William Morrow & Co., 1999; p. 60. <blockquote>\"Gerri? Where are you?\"<br />\"I'm at home. Who's this?\" <br /> \"This is the president.\"<br />\"Oh, I think someone's playing with me.\"</blockquote></ref> She applied for the job and was offered the position.\n\nHaving a black woman in the White House was very unusual in the early 1960s. Johnson wanted to advertise the fact that he'd hired a black woman, but chose not to call a [[news conference]]. Instead, he arranged for Whittington to appear on the television [[game show]] ''\"[[What's My Line?]]\"'', wherein contestants attempted to guess her profession. This may have seemed less overt, but probably exposed her to more viewers than if a standard press conference had been held.\n\nWhittington appeared on episode #696 of the game show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' on January 19, 1964. She was the first contestant. The mystery guest that evening was Van Heflin and the panel consisted of Arlene Francis, Steve Allen, Dorothy Kilgallen and Bennett Cerf. After Whittington signed the blackboard as \"Jerri Whittington,\" she told host John Daly that she was from [[West River, Maryland]]. Whittington's occupation was shown on the screen as \"Secretary to President Johnson.\" After her game, she described President Lyndon Johnson with the following words, \"great warmth, fair, kind, a perfectionist.\"\n\nLater Whittington appeared in several magazines, including ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' and ''[[Sepia (magazine)|Sepia]]''.\n\nShe was the first person to learn that Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] had been nominated by President Johnson to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Minutes before LBJ made the official announcement, he took his nominee down to her office and said, \"Here's the next Supreme Court Justice!\" She told friends that she thanked the President for making the choice of the first Black court justice.
