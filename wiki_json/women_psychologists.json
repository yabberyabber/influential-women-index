Her focus is primarily on mental systems that operate in implicit or unconscious mode. In particular, she is interested in the unconscious nature of assessments of self and other humans that reflect feelings and knowledge (often unintended) about their social group membership (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, gender, class) that underlie the us/them distinction.\n\nFrom such study of attitudes and beliefs of adults and children, she asks about the social consequences of unconscious thought and feeling. Banaji\u2019s work relies on cognitive/affective behavioral measures and [[neuroimaging]] ([[fMRI]]) with which she explores the implications of her work for questions of individual responsibility and social justice in democratic societies.\n\n==Major publications==\n*{{citation |date=September 1989 |author=Banaji, Mahzarin R. |author2=Crowder, Robert G |last-author-amp=yes |title=The bankruptcy of everyday memory research |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |volume=44 |issue=9|pages=1185\u20131193 |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~mrbworks/articles/1989_AmrPsy.pdf | doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.9.1185}} A seminal article on two primary research methods (experimental and ecological) and issues associated with each.\n*{{citation |year=1991 |author1=Banaji, M.R.  |author2=Crowder, R.G  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Some everyday thoughts on ecologically valid methods |journal=American Psychologist |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=78\u201379 |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~mrbworks/articles/1991_AmrPsy.pdf|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.46.1.78 }}.

There she published her first of almost 200 papers. In 1928, Bayley moved to the University of California, Berkeley, to work in the Institute of Child Welfare.  It was here that Bayley began work on the Berkeley Growth Study. On April 7, 1929, she married her husband, John, R. Reid. He was at the University of California, Berkeley completing his own doctoral work in philosophy.  In 1954, she went to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] in Bethesda, Maryland, where she worked on child development in the Laboratory of Psychology. In 1964, Bayley returned to Berkeley and published the [[Bayley Scales of Infant Development]]. She retired in 1968 but continued to revise the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.<ref name=\":0\" /> Bayley and her husband lived the remainder of their lives in Carmel, California.

The sample decreased to 42 participating children by 1941, due primarily to family relocation.\n\n=== Measurements<ref name=\":2\" /> ===\nBayley assessed the children on their physical, motor, mental, and physiological development. An analysis of trends in the data was then conducted, with particular reference to the age of developments, as well as a correlational investigation of relating factors. Assessments were conducted once a month from birth to 15 months, once every three months from 15\u201336 months, and every six months after 36 months. Initial measurements focused on reflexes and bodily measurements, such as blood pressure and breathing rates. Additionally, information was gathered regarding the maternal and prenatal history. Subsequent assessments were conducted at the Institute for Child Welfare, as well as at home visits, pediatric centers, and at play-based field group outings.\n\nMental measurements included the California First-Year Mental Scale, the California Pre-school Mental Scale, vocabulary tests, and [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford-Binet]] intelligence tests. Motor assessments examined speed, dexterity, and reflexes, amongst other things. Participants completed the California Infant Scale of Motor Development, as well as examinations of footprint records. Physiological tests assessed exercise and exertion abilities, the [[Skin conductance response|galvanic skin reflex]], and metabolism. Additional assessments involved body dimensions, x-rays, and tests of emotion and personality.\n\n=== Outcomes ===\nVariations in intelligence across the lifespan led Bayley to conclude that intelligence is not fixed at birth, but instead impacted by encounters with environmental factors.<ref name=\":6\" /> Bayley thus argued that hindrances in development stemmed from social influences, such as poverty, rather than psychological influences.<ref name=\":7\" /> Other factors Bayley considered vitally important to development were parenting attitudes and behaviors.<ref name=\":7\" /> Examinations of x-rays and physiological growth led Bayley to become the first scientist to recognize the predictability of adult height based on infant size.<ref name=\":7\" /> Additionally, Bayley discovered no gender differences in terms of physical and psychological development.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMeasures of assessment were later published by Bayley, including the California First-Year Mental Scale and the California Infant Scale of Motor Development, which collectively lead to the development of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Bayley Scales of Infant Development ==\n\n=== Developing The Scales ===\nThe original version of the [[Bayley Scales of Infant Development|Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development]] were published by Nancy Bayley in 1969, though they have since been revised to the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-II (BSID-II) and the currently used BSID-III.<ref name=\":4\" />  The original BSID was developed by combining three previous scales: the California First-Year Mental Scale, the California Preschool Mental Scale, and the California Infant Scale of Motor Development.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal|last1=Nellis|first1=Leah|last2=Gridley|first2=Betty E.|title=Review of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development\u2014Second edition|journal=Journal of School Psychology|date=1994|volume=32|issue=2|pages=201\u2013209}}</ref> The purpose of the BSID-III is to gain further information about a child's developmental milestones and abilities, as well as to intervene at an early age if a learning disability presents itself.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite web|title=NINDS CDE Notice of Copyright  Bayley Scale of Infant Development (Bayley III, BSID)|url=https://commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/Doc/NOC/Bayley_Scales_of_Infant_Development_NOC_Link.pdf|website=Common Data Elements|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Measurements ===\nThe Mental and Motor Scales have remained relatively the same through all versions, with some changes made to the Behavior Rating Scale.  These changes include: age range, norms altered to function more successfully with modernization, and greater validity and reliability. The Mental Scale presented in BSID-II assesses children using a normalized standardized scoring system - the Mental Development Index (MDI) - and a standard scoring system - the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI).  The MDI is used to measure mental capabilities in children, including sensory and perceptual acuities, object constancy, memory, learning, problem solving, early verbal communication, early abstract thinking ability, and early number concepts.  The PDI is used to gauge control of the body, such as fine and gross motor skills.  The Behavior Rating Scale presents a numerical assessment of a child's attention, arousal, orientation/engagement, emotional regulation, and motor ability.  The BSID-III is most beneficial for studies regarding developmental, psychological, and neuropsychological information in children up to 42 months old; after 42 months of age the information becomes less reliable.<ref name=\":9\" />  The amount of time required to administer the test depends greatly on the age of the child.  This variability occurs because each portion of the test has specific instructions on how to administer it to the child. For instance, in the motor tasks there are certain positions the child is to be placed in.<ref name=\":10\" />  When scoring the test, each task throughout both motor and cognitive is either given or not given credit based on how the child responds to the task that is presented.  Notes are made along the way while administering the test if there are refusals made, items are omitted, or there is an issue with the caregiver report. In these cases, an examiner will go back and administer another exam to obtain data for that test.\n\n==   Selected Works ==\nBayley, N., & Jones, H. E. (1937).

Much remains to be done regarding the participation of women in science and technological innovation. Also the empowerment of women in their sexual and reproductive choices remains highly controversial. The most difficult thing, from my experience, are the institutional cultures and subjectivities that are threatened by changes that touch very deep, unconscious fibers that can generate fears and resistance \".

Boomsma''' (born 18 November 1957, Huizen, The Netherlands) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Biological psychology|biological psychologist]] specializing in [[genetics]] and [[twin study|twin studies]].\n\n== Education ==\n* Secondary education: Willem de Zwijgerlyceum, [[Bussum]]\n* Bachelor's: [[Vrije Universiteit]] in Psychology, [[Latin honors|cum laude]], 1979\n* Master's: Vrije Universiteit in Psychophysiology, cum laude, 1983\n* Master's: [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] in Biological Psychology/Behavior Genetics,1983\n* [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]: Vrije Universiteit (thesis: Quantitative Genetics of Cardiovascular Risk), cum laude, 1992\n\n== Career ==\n\nAfter receiving her Ph.D., Boomsma received an appointment as an assistant [[professor]] at the Vrije Universiteit in the Department of [[Psychonomics]]. In 1994 she became associate and in 1998 full professor and head of the Department of [[Biological psychology|Biological Psychology]].\n\n== Twin studies ==\nBoomsma has built a database of over 75,000 twins and family members in The Netherlands,<ref name=\"twins\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tweelingenregister.org/index_uk.html |title=Vrije Universiteit - Nederlands Tweelingen Register |work= |accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref> which has been used for dozens of twin studies. The twins and their families have undergone periodic testing over a period of decades, providing a mass of longitudinal data for [[Statistics|statistical analysis]]. A large number of participants have also provided DNA, blood, and urine samples for testing. Her research has primarily focused on better understanding the influence of [[heredity]] on various physical and mental diseases, including [[cardiovascular disease]]s, pediatric [[bipolar disorder]], and [[major depressive disorder|depression]]. This work has been reported in over 450 published papers and one book and has led to many awards for Boomsma.\n\n== Research ==\n[[Twin study|Twin studies]]<ref>[http://www.tweelingenregister.org/nederlands/verslaggeving/NTR_publicaties/Dorret%20Nature%20Review%20Genetics.pdf Classical Twin Studies and Beyond, www.nature.com]</ref> provide a way to understand how [[genotype]] affects an observable characteristic (called a [[phenotype]]). In short, identical ([[monozygotic]]) twins carry the same [[allele]]s for 100% of their [[gene]]s whereas fraternal ([[dizygotic]]) twins will carry different alleles at 50% of the genes for which their parents had different [[genotypes]]. So if some characteristic (say, depression) that is observed in one identical twin is always observed in the other one, but this does not hold for fraternal twins, then one can conclude that heredity plays an important role in causing the condition.\n\nBoomsma has been a pioneer in collecting a broad spectrum of data (e.g., medical histories, [[Intelligence quotient|IQ tests]], MRI scans) and biological material (e.g., DNA and RNA samples, blood and urine samples) from thousands of twins and analyzing them to determine the role of genetics in characteristics as varied as adult height, brain volume, intelligence, migraine headaches, anxiety, [[drug addiction]], and love of coffee.\n\nHer results span a wide range of behavioral characteristics, including discovery of the surprisingly large genetic component to feelings of loneliness,<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/11/051110222344.htm Heredity May Be the Reason Some People Feel Lonely, Science Daily]</ref> the fact that first borns have higher IQs than their younger siblings,<ref>[http://www.themedguru.com/articles/first_born_babies_more_intelligent_than_their_siblings_study-7323931.html First-Born Babies More Intelligent than their Siblings, Medguru]</ref> and the increased influence of genetics on [[body weight]] as children grow older.<ref>[http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/10475/1/Estourgie_TRHG_2006.pdf Body Size in Five-Year-Old Twins: Heritability and Comparison to Singleton Standards, Twin Research and Human Genetics]</ref>\n\n== European Research Council Advanced Grant ==\nIn 2008, the [[European Research Council]] began awarding grants of about 2.5 million [[euro]] (about $3.5 million) to the top scientists and scholars in Europe via a competition that covered all [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]]. Due to the large amount of money and complete lack of bureaucracy and restrictions, these were extremely competitive, with a very strong applicant pool and a 13% acceptance rate. Boomsma received one of the ERC grants for a project on the genetics of [[mental illness]]. Her research is focusing on three themes:\n\n* Neuropsychiatric disorders (ADHD, anxiety, depression) and cognition\n* Depression, anxiety, substance use, abuse, and dependence\n* Depression, migraine, obesity, and cardiovascular disease\n\nThe goal of this research is to use her twin database and biological specimens to try to determine which genes play a role in causing these conditions.\n\n== Awards ==\nBoomsma has received several awards for her research.

Darasha maintained that in a nurturing environment where they were not set up to fail in comparison with boys, girls would flourish and blossom. Her creative use of drama in education was an extension of her enduring interest in the stage \u2013 as playwright, producer and director. Over the years, Darasha established herself as a distinct and passionate figure in the field of female education in India.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Revolutionary Salutes Another|first= Soma|last= Das|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/one-revolutionary-salutes-another/183198|date=28 September 2012|accessdate= 29 June 2014|publisher=MidDay}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and background ==\n\nShirin Darasha was born and raised in a [[Parsi]] Zoroastrian family in [[Mumbai]], erstwhile [[Bombay]] [[India]].\nOn graduating (matriculation) from Queen Mary School, Bombay she attended [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai]], studying for a Bachelor's in Psychology. On completion, she studied further to earn her master's degree in Psychology, also from [[Bombay University]]. To pursue further studies abroad, Shirin Darasha was awarded the [[Fulbright scholarship]]. She completed her master's degree in Education from [[East-West Center]], Hawaii.\n\n== Career ==\n\nPrior to her appointment as Principal of J.B. Petit School in 1972, Shirin Darasha worked at Hindi Vidya Bhavan and The Bombay International School.\n \nDarasha was a talented playwright who focussed on themes and personalities associated with twentieth century Indian history.  Her popular play \"[[Madam Cama]]\" was first staged in 1988. In 1990, during the Fifth World Zoroastrian Congress, a special performance of the play was included in the proceedings. The play was also televised on [[Doordarshan]].  In her plays, Darasha challenged social conventions that resulted in women being stereotyped.  She was particularly caustic about matrimonial advertisements; she dealt head-on with the Indian preference for \"light complexions\" and made a characteristic case for how \"dark skin\" was beautiful. Darasha's collaborations with [[Pearl Padamsee]] in various stage productions in Mumbai were well known and widely admired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering Pearl Padamsee |first= Anil |last=Dharker|url=http://lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&pageid=30&sectid=edid=&edlabel=TOIM&mydateHid=22-04-2010&pubname=&edname=&articleid=Ar03000&publabel=TOI.php|accessdate=4 July 2014|publisher=The Times Group}}</ref>\nDarasha was elated when her J.B. School Debate Team won the all-India Debate Competition hosted by the [[Foundation for Universal Responsibility of His Holiness the Dalai Lama]]; the prize was a trip for the whole debate team and for Darasha to visit His Holiness the Dalai Lama at his ashram and have a private audience with him.<ref>{{dead link|date=July 2014}}{{cite web|title=Remembering Ms Darasha|url=http://jbpetithighschool.com/remembering_ms_darasha9.php|accessdate=4 July 2014|publisher=J.

In February 1988, the ''Parisiana'' ran an article entitled \"The 'Principal' of Drama\" which focused on her lifelong passion for the stage.  In her interview, she declared that she did not consider herself religious, though she had Buddhist leanings.  When she died, based on her instructions, there was no traditional Parsi funeral.  Instead, her body was cremated in a simple non-denominational funeral service.\n\n== Death ==\n\nAt the age of 74, Shirin Darasha died of pulmonary fibrosis.  She was cremated and her funeral was attended by hundreds of students and teachers who had been taught, mentored and inspired by her over the decades.\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n<gallery mode= packed heights=300px>\nFile:Irish_Blessing_that_Shirin_Darasha_handed_out_to_every_student_and_teacher_under_her_aegis.jpg|Inspirational blessing that Shirin Darasha handed out to each and every student and teacher who was under her aegis when she was principal\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Parsis]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://jbpetithighschool.com/ J.

She will then first be in charge of classes in the [[University of Li\u00e8ge]] in 1984, then Ordinary Professor in 1988 and finally dean of the Faculty of Psychology from 1990 to 1998.  Her academic career - which will see her become an internationally recognised specialist in applied research in security and human reliability in risk environments as well as in ergonomics - will allow her to build bridges between a variety of scientific communities and to develop academic collaborations with the [[United States of America]], [[Russia]], [[South America]] and [[Africa]].  She was president of the \"European Work and Organizational Psychology Association\" (EAWOP), and president of the Ergonomics Society of the French Language, and is currently the director of the Excellency Center of the [[University of Li\u00e8ge]] on the modeling of temporal reasoning in dynamic situations.

Tight cultures are more restrictive, with stricter disciplinary measures for norm violations while loose cultures have weaker social norms and a higher tolerance for deviant behavior. Gelfand found that a history of threats, such as natural disasters, high population density, or vulnerability to infectious diseases, is associated with greater tightness. Her research has shown that tightness allows cultures to coordinate more effectively to survive threats.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Gelfand|first=Michele J.|last2=Raver|first2=Jana L.|last3=Nishii|first3=Lisa|last4=Leslie|first4=Lisa M.|last5=Lun|first5=Janetta|last6=Lim|first6=Beng Chong|last7=et al|date=2011-05-27|title=Differences Between Tight and Loose Cultures: A 33-Nation Study|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6033/1100|journal=Science|language=en|volume=332|issue=6033|pages=1100\u20131104|doi=10.1126/science.1197754|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21617077|bibcode=2011Sci...332.1100G}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Jesse R.|last2=Gelfand|first2=Michele J.|date=2014|title=Tightness\u2013looseness across the 50 united states|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/22/7990.full.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n*  Carol and Ed Diener Award in Social Psychology, [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology]] (2015)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spsp.org/annualawards/diener-award-social-psychology|title=Diener Award in Social Psychology, Past Recipients|website=Society for Personality and Social Psychology|access-date=2016-06-03}}</ref>\n*  William A.

Gottfredson's work has been influential in shaping U.S. public and private policies regarding [[affirmative action]], hiring quotas, and \"[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-norming\" on aptitude tests.\n\nShe is on the boards of the [[International Society for the Study of Individual Differences]] (ISSID), the [[International Society for Intelligence Research]] (ISIR), and the editorial boards of the scientific journals ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'', ''[[Learning and Individual Differences]]'', and ''[[Society (journal)|Society]]''.

She also taught in schools for the disadvantaged for a time when she was young.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0765804972&id=VLtTKixjfYQC&pg=PA97&]</ref> They both went to graduate school at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where she received a Ph.D. in sociology in 1977.\n\nGottfredson took a position at Hopkins' Center for Social Organization of Schools and investigated issues of occupational segregation and typology based on skill sets and intellectual capacity. She married [[Robert A. Gordon]], who worked in a related area at Hopkins, and they divorced by the mid-90s.<ref>[http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/1994/nov2894/gordon.html]</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Gottfredson participated in a conference called \"The [[General intelligence factor|g Factor]] in Employment Testing.\" The papers presented were published in the December 1986 issue of the ''Journal of Vocational Behavior'', which she edited. In 1986, Gottfredson was appointed Associate Professor of Educational Studies at the [[University of Delaware]], Newark.\n\nThat year, she presented a series of papers on general intelligence factor and employment. Gottfredson has said \"We now have out there what I call the egalitarian fiction that all groups are equal in intelligence. We have social policy based on that fiction. For example, the [[1991 Civil Rights Act]] codified ''Griggs vs. Duke Power'', which said that if you have disproportionate hiring by race, you are prima facie -- that's prima facie evidence of racial discrimination. ...Differences in intelligence have real world effects, whether we think they're there or not, whether we want to wish them away or not. And we don't do anybody any good, certainly not the low-IQ people, by denying that those problems exist...\"<ref>[http://aad.english.ucsb.edu/docs/PBS-oct94.htm \"Race, IQ, Success and Charles Murray\"]</ref>\n\nShe was promoted to full professor at the University of Delaware in 1990.\n\nGottfredson's research and views have stirred considerable controversy, especially her testimony on public affirmative action policy and her defense of ''[[The Bell Curve]],'' especially ''[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]'', a statement she wrote, which was signed by 51 colleagues and published in the ''[[The Wall Street Journal]].''<ref name=\"gottfredson\">Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', p A18.</ref> Since then she has written a number of articles on [[race and intelligence]], especially as it applies to occupational qualification.\n\n==Criticism==\nAccording to sociocultural anthropologist [[Francisco Gil-White]], in publishing studies financed by the Pioneer Fund, Linda Gottfredson is part of a concerted effort to legitimize racist ideology through pseudo-science, together with an assortment of other people with inadequate or completely missing scientific qualifications for studying human intelligence:\n<small>\n:''suspicion naturally grows when one finds that Pioneer Fund recipients have only one thing in common: they attack blacks''\n:[...]\n:''The outspoken Linda Gottfredson once again is neither a psychologist nor a biologist, but a sociologist who teaches in the Department of Education at the University of Delaware. So we have a physicist, a philosopher, and a sociologist. What do they have in common with the IQ-testers? Other than that they attack blacks from their academic perches and collect their rewards from the Pioneer Fund, nothing.''<ref>http://www.hirhome.com/rr/rrchap11.htm</ref></small>\n\n[[Barry Mehler]] writes in ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'' that Gottfredson is attempting to promote racial theories used by the [[Nazis]]:\n<small>\n:''Thus we see that Gottfredson's opposition to affirmative action is based not in any such claimed \"objectivity\", but in a sanitized resurrection of ideas put forward by Nazi racial theorists. Under the false pretense of intellectual honesty, she has endorsed the same poisonous ideology that half a century ago led to the Holocaust.''<ref>Mehler 1994</ref></small>\n\nAccording to the website ''Tracking the Alternative Right'':\n<small>\n:''Linda Gottfredson joined Stefan Molyneux for the December 29 broadcast of Freedomain Radio, entitled \"Race, Evolution and Intelligence.\" Using recycled claims from''The Bell Curve'' \u2014 a notorious book by Richard Herrnstein (1930\u20131994) and Charles Murray \u2014 Molyneux asserted that there is a racial hierarchy as far as IQ distribution is concerned.\n:[...]\n:''Gottfredson, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Delaware, agreed, noting that Molyneux neglected to mention one final racial category. \"I would just add one more group, um, and that's African blacks. Um, the IQs of different, uh, groups of African blacks, you know, range more around 70.\" Gottfredson, of course, has accepted $267,000 in research grants by the racist Pioneer Fund since 1988, and was a staunch opponent of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.''<ref>[https://hailtothegynocracy.wordpress.com/2016/01/02/stefan-molyneux-and-linda-gottfredson-promote-scientific-racism/]</ref></small>\n\n== Professional service ==\n* Editorial board, Intelligence, 2004\u2013present.\n* Board of editorial advisors, Society, 1997\u2013present.\n* [[Editorial board]], Learning and Individual Differences, 2004\u20132008.\n* [[Advisory board]], International Society for Intelligence Research, 2000\u20132010 (Founding Member).\n* Board of directors, International Society for the Study of Individual Differences, 2005\u20132001.<ref>[http://www.issid.org/officers/default.html \"List of previous officers\"]</ref>\n* Editorial board, [[The Psychologist-Manager Journal]], 1997\u20132000.\n* National Council, [[Federation of American Scientists]], 1995\u20131999.\n* Testimony before the [[House Judiciary Committee]], Subcommittee on the Constitution, Oversight hearing on the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, [[Washington, D.C.]], May 20, 1997.\n* [[Board of directors]], Society of Psychologists in Management, 1994\u20131997.\n* Board of directors, Society for the Study of Social Biology, 1990\u20131994.\n* Editorial board, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 1983\u20131990.\n* Consultant, Department of Labor (DOT revision [APDOT, contract to American Psychological Association], implementation of \"Goals 2000\" [contract to Institute for Educational Leadership]), 1992\u20131995.\n* [[Consultant]], Department of Defense Student Testing Program contract awarded to Booz-Allen, Inc. 1989\u20131991.\n* Panel member, Advisory Panel on the Identification of Alternative Approaches for reporting Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) scores.

Haste is interested especially in how cultural narratives and metaphors are reflected in the development of young people's beliefs. Her work on science, society, and gender has explored the cultural images of science, how they reflect dominant models of rationality, how these are associated with conceptions of gender, and how they influence motivation to take up science interests.

The study showed that the way in which questions were worded altered the memories subjects reported.<ref name=\"chap 4 Do Justice\" /><ref name=Saletan />  Loftus\u2019 next step was to investigate whether asking leading questions, or providing misleading information in other forms, might also affect people\u2019s memory for the original event.<ref name=\"chap 4 Do Justice\" />  To answer this question, she developed the [[misinformation effect]] paradigm, which demonstrated that the memories of eyewitnesses are altered after being exposed to incorrect information about an event; and that memory is highly malleable and open to suggestion.<ref name=\"chap 4 Do Justice\" /><ref name=Neimark /><ref name = Wilson />  The misinformation effect became one of the most influential and widely known effects in psychology,<ref name=\"chap 4 Do Justice\" /> and Loftus\u2019 early work on the effect generated hundreds of follow-up studies examining factors that improve or worsen the accuracy of memories, and to explored the cognitive mechanisms underlying the effect.<ref name=\"chap 4 Do Justice\" /><ref name=Neimark />\n\n=====Expert testimony=====\nLoftus has testified and advised courts about the nature of eyewitness memory for many cases.<ref name=\"pnas\" /><ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /> This direct involvement with the application of her work to the legal system grew from an article Loftus published in 1974 about the relationship between findings from psychological science and the witness testimony in a murder trial she had observed,<ref name=\"chap 2 Do Justice\" /><ref name=\"pnas\" /><ref name=Saletan /> in which conflicting witness memory played a key role in the evidence.<ref name=Saletan /> Lawyers who read the article began to contact Loftus to consult her about their cases, and judges requested educational seminars about eyewitness evidence, so she began her work as an educator of legal practitioners.<ref name=\"chap 2 Do Justice\" /><ref name=Saletan />  In 1975 Loftus set a legal [[precedent]] when she provided [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]\u2019s first expert testimony about eyewitness memory (specifically, on the topic of eyewitness identification).<ref name=\"pnas\" /><ref name=\"chap 3 Do Justice\" /> She has since testified in over 250 cases and consulted on many more.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson />\n\nNotable cases she has been involved in due to her expertise include the [[McMartin preschool trial]], [[O.J.

The impetus for this new line of research was a case for which Loftus had been asked to provide expert testimony in 1990.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref name=\"chap 1 Do Justice\" /><ref name=\"chap 8 Do Justice\">{{cite book | last = Strange | first = D | author2 = Clifasefi S | author3 = Garry M | year = 2007 | chapter = False memories. | editors = Garry M & Hayne H | title = Do Justice and Let the Sky Fall: Elizabeth F.

Her student Jim Coan developed the [[lost in the mall technique]]. The method involves attempting to implant a false memory of being lost in a shopping mall as a child and testing whether discussing a false event could produce a \"memory\" despite never happening.  In her initial study, Loftus found that 25% of subjects came to develop a \"memory\" for the event which had never actually taken place.<ref name = Wilson /><ref name=\"chap 8 Do Justice\" />  Extensions and variations of the lost in the mall technique found that an average of one third of experimental subjects could become convinced that they experienced things in childhood that had never really occurred\u2014even highly traumatic, and impossible events.<ref name=\"chap 8 Do Justice\" />  Loftus\u2019 work was used to oppose recovered memory evidence provided in court<ref name = Wilson /> and resulted in stricter requirements for the use of recovered memories being used in trials as well as a greater requirement for [[corroborating evidence]].  In addition, some states no longer allowed prosecution based on recovered memory testimony and insurance companies were more reluctant to insure therapists against malpractice suits relating to recovered memories.<ref name=Neimark /><ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson />\n\n=====Criticisms and harassment related to research=====\nLoftus\u2019 first study using the lost in the mall technique was criticized by Lynn Crook and Martha Dean based on the ethics of the subject recruitment method used.<ref name =Crook>{{cite journal | last = Crook | first = L. | year = 1999 | title = Lost in a Shopping Mall--A Breach of Professional Ethics | journal = Ethics & Behavior. | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 39\u201350 | url = http://users.owt.com/crook/memory/ | accessdate = 2008-01-18 | doi = 10.1207/s15327019eb0901_3 | last2 = Dean | first2 = Martha | pmid = 11657487}}</ref>  Also, Kenneth Pope has argued she inappropriately generalized the findings to draw conclusions about false memories and therapeutic techniques.<ref name =Crook /><ref name=pope1996b>{{cite journal | last = Pope | first = K. | year = 1996 | title = Memory, Abuse, and Science: Questioning Claims about the False Memory Syndrome Epidemic | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 51 | issue = 9 | pages = 957\u2013974 | url = http://www.kspope.com/memory/memory.php | accessdate = 2008-01-31 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.51.9.957 | pmid = 8819364}}</ref>  These writers purported to identify errors, exaggerations, and omissions in her research. Loftus published a rebuttal to these critics and stated that the criticisms appeared to be based on personal animosity rather than a valid understanding of the research. Regarding the ethics of the creation of the study, Loftus stated that it was primarily a colleague who piloted the study with his daughter, and later revisited the idea as part of an undergraduate class she was teaching.  She also emphasized that participants demonstrated no adverse effects upon follow-up and pointed out that the study design and findings had been replicated repeatedly, demonstrating the soundness of the conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Loftus | first = E | year = 1999 | journal = Ethics & Behavior | title = Lost in the mall: Misrepresentations and misunderstandings | url = http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall07/brunnquelld/psy8542/Session%2015/Loftus%20-Lost%20in%20the%20Mall%20-%20Misrepresentations%20and%20misubders.pdf | format = PDF | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 51\u201360 | pmid = 11657488 | doi = 10.1207/s15327019eb0901_4}}</ref>  In addition to opposition from fellow researchers, Loftus has been insulted by a prosecutor, attacked by an airplane passenger who recognized her,<ref name=Neimark /><ref name = Wilson /> received hate mail and death threats,<ref name = Wilson /><ref name=Abramsky>{{cite news | last = Abramsky | first = S | date = 2004-08-19 | title = Memory and Manipulation: The trials of Elizabeth Loftus, defender of the wrongly accused | work = [[LA Weekly]] | url = http://www.laweekly.com/2004-08-19/news/memory-and-manipulation/ | accessdate = 2012-06-10}}</ref> and has had to have protection by security guards while giving invited addresses.<ref name=Neimark /><ref name=Saletan />\n\nAfter criticizing the theory of recovered memory and testifying about the nature of memory and [[False allegation of child sexual abuse|false allegations of child sexual abuse]] as part of the [[day care sex abuse hysteria]], Loftus was subject to on-line harassment by [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]] [[Diana Napolis]], who believed Loftus was engaged in [[satanic ritual abuse]] or assisted in covering up these crimes as part of a larger conspiracy.<ref name = Cyberstalking>{{cite book | author = Bocij, Paul | title = Cyberstalking: harassment in the Internet age and how to protect your family | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishers]] | location = New York | year = 2004 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=q8NZLBE0sm0C&pg=PA34 34] | isbn = 0-275-98118-5 | oclc =  | doi =}}</ref>\n\n=====\"Jane Doe\" case=====\n{{main|Jane Doe case}}\nThe case that has arguably had the biggest negative impact on Loftus is that of [[Jane Doe case|\"Jane Doe\"]] (real name Nicole Taus).

(1991, April).[http://micro5.mscc.huji.ac.il/~msninio/INTRO-CODING.doc Introduction to the Ninio and Wheeler taxonomy of verbal communicative acts and to the INCA abridged version.] Paper presented at the Biennial Meeting of the Society for Research in Child Development, Seattle, Washington, April, 1991.</ref> An abridged version of it (Inventory of Communicative Acts-Abridged, INCA-A),<ref name=INCA /> was prepared by Ninio for use by Catherine Snow, Barbara Pan, and colleagues at Harvard University in the research project \u201cFoundations for Language Assessment in Spontaneous Speech\u201d funded by the [[NIH|National Institutes of Health]]. The abridged version has been adopted as the official communicative coding system of the [[CHILDES|Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES)]] project.<ref>MacWhinney, B. (2000). The CHILDES project: Tools for analyzing talk, Vol 1: Transcription format and programs (3rd ed.). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. pp. 99-102. See also the [http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/chat.pdf online manual.]</ref> INCA-A has the same speech act codes but a less detailed repertoire of talk interchange codes than the full Ninio and Wheeler version. Both versions of the Ninio and Wheeler system are widely used in projects on English as well as Hebrew, Dutch, German, Irish, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Romanian, Turkish, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and others. They are also used in research involving young adults, second language learners, peer conversations, children in the Head Start program, aphasics, autistic children, visually impaired children, and more.\n\n==Syntactic development==\n\nUnexpectedly for an empiricist who emphasizes learning and the interactive context of acquisition, Ninio uses as her linguistic framework Chomsky\u2019s Minimalist Program alongside the formally analogous [[Dependency grammar|Dependency Grammar]]. The appeal to the binary combining operation [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] (or Dependency) and the use of grammatical relations as atomic units of analysis makes her work on syntactic development unusual in the field where many researchers prefer such holistic approaches as [[Construction Grammar]], or else forsake linguistically oriented analyses in favor of statistical patterns to be found by automatic means. In her empirical work, Ninio employs the methods of [[Corpus linguistics|corpus-based linguistics]] in order to characterize child-directed speech and young children\u2019s early multiword productions. In her study of the acquisition of the core grammatical relations of English, her research team constructed a 1.5 million words strong parental corpus and a 200,000 words strong child corpus, parsing them manually for the relevant syntactic relations.<ref name=Ninio2011 />\n\nIn describing the development of language in children, Ninio adopts the concepts and methods of [[Complexity Science]] describing the process of acquisition as one in which young children join a [[complex network]] of speakers and speech as new participants in the network. In this theoretical model, children are likened to new users of the [[World-Wide Web]] who both use the WWW and also create it with their own productions<ref name=Ninio2006 /><ref>[http://micro5.mscc.huji.ac.il/~msninio/papers.html_Publications_on_language_acquisition Some of Anat Ninio\u2019s publications on language acquisition]</ref> The pragmatic uses of speech for communication among speakers are thus viewed not only as the background and context of acquisition but also as building blocks of connectivity in the complex system which is [[language]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://micro5.mscc.huji.ac.il/~msninio/ Anat Ninio\u2019s official website]\n* [http://psychology.huji.ac.il/en/?cmd=Faculty.113&page=2&act=read&id=14 Anat Ninio\u2019s faculty biography, Department of Psychology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.]\n* {{GoogleScholar|id=91C1oC4AAAAJ}}\n* [http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~rferrericancho/linguistic_and_cognitive_networks.html Bibliography on cognitive and linguistic networks]\n* [http://www.lingviko.net/dgb.htm Bibliography of Dependency Grammar]\n* [http://www.gabormelli.com/RKB/2000_DependencyGrammar Richard Hudson\u2019s 2000 Dependency Grammar]\n* [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/dick/wg.htm A bibliography on Word Grammar]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ninio, Anat}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1944 births]]\n[[Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni]]\n[[Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty]]\n[[Category:Israeli academics]]\n[[Category:Israeli psychologists]]\n[[Category:Developmental psychologists]]\n[[Category:Cognitive scientists]]\n[[Category:Developmental psycholinguists]]\n[[Category:Psycholinguists]]\n[[Category:Israeli scientists]]\n[[Category:People from Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Women psychologists]]"}]},"2987150":{"pageid":2987150,"ns":0,"title":"Becky Wai-Ling Packard","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"'''Becky Wai-Ling Packard''' is Professor of Psychology and Education, and Director of the Weissman Center for Leadership at [[Mount Holyoke College]].\n\nShe received her B.A. from the [[University of Michigan]] and her Ph.D. from [[Michigan State University]].

She was the first female [[full professor]] in [[psychology]] in the history of [[Yale University]]. She established core resources for the study of development, including the [[Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study]] and the [[Minnesota Adolescent Adoption Study]]. She served as president of multiple societies including the [[Association for Psychological Science]] and was honoured with multiple awards including the [[James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award]]. She was also active in the development of commercial childcare. Her work with [[Twin study|twins]] in the 1960s revealed strong genetic influences on intellectual development. One of her key findings was that this differed with [[Race (human classification)|race]] and [[socioeconomic status]] (SES), with poor and non-white children showing less genetic influence on their IQ and more environmental influence. She demonstrated a successful intervention in [[premature birth|premature]] infants, showing that stimulation improved their health and developmental outcomes.\n\nAt Minnesota, she and [[Richard A. Weinberg]] found that black and interracial children adopted early into white homes initially had outcomes more similar to the white average, suggesting a role of family environment early in life. By their teens, adoptees with two black birth parents achieved lower scores than did adoptees with one or no black birth parents, suggesting a genetic component to race differences in [[IQ]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}<!-- Given that other explanations are possible, this needs a *secondary* source -->\n\nAlong with the Scarr-Rowe effect of SES on the heritability of intelligence, another key intellectual landmark established by Scarr was that \"Rather than the home environment having a cumulative impact across development, its influence ''wanes'' from early childhood to adolescence.\"<ref name=\"models\"/> She sought also to advance scientific psychology, and in 1991 co-founded ''[[Current Directions In Psychological Science]]''.<ref name=\"models\"/> She retired to, and continues to thrive in, Hawaii.\n\n== Biography ==\nScarr was the child of school teacher Jane Powell Wood and [[John Ruxton Wood]], a US Army physician, who in 1942 was appointed director of [[Edgewood Chemical Biological Center|Army Research Laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal]] and who in 1950 headed the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]].<ref name=\"models\"/> Scarr spent most of her childhood in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area and went to the [[Bryn Mawr School|Bryn Mawr School for Girls]] and the [[National Cathedral School]]. After completing her undergraduate studies at [[Vassar College]] in 1958, where she was involved in undergraduate research with [[Harriet Zuckerman]], Scarr worked for a couple of years first at a family and child service and then at [[National Institute of Mental Health]] as a research assistant. In 1960 she enrolled at [[Harvard University]], from where she earned her Ph.D. in psychology in 1965, specializing in [[developmental psychology]] and [[behavioural genetics]]. During graduate school, she married fellow sociology student Harry Scarr with whom she has a son, Phillip (1962).<ref name=\"models\"/>\n\nThough she initially had a difficult time finding a job because she had a child,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} she eventually taught at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[University of Minnesota]], and [[Yale University]]. She was the first woman full professor in psychology in the history of Yale University. In 1983 she accepted a position as Commonwealth Professor and chair of the psychology department at the [[University of Virginia]], where she remained until her retirement.<ref name=\"models\">O'Connell AN (2001).''Models of Achievement: Reflections of Eminent Women in Psychology, Vol.3.''

In 1993, she was elected chairman of the Board and in 1995 became CEO and chairman of KinderCare. While at KinderCare, Scarr instituted NAEYC accreditation for the centers and worked to improve the wages and working conditions of center staffs. In 1997, KinderCare was bought by Kohlberg, Kravitz, and Roberts Investments, and Scarr retired.\n\nIn the 1960s, Scarr studied identical and fraternal twins' aptitude and school achievement scores. The study revealed that intellectual development was heavily influenced by genetic ability, especially among more advantaged children. It also showed that on average, black children demonstrated less genetic and more environmental influence on their intelligence than white children. Scarr also collaborated with Margaret Williams on a clinical study which demonstrated that [[premature birth]] infants who receive stimulation gain weight faster and recover faster than babies left in isolation (the practice at that time).\n\nIn 1972 she married fellow researcher [[Philip Salapatek]], with whom she also coauthored papers. They had a daughter, Stephanie (November 1973).<ref name=\"models\"/> They moved to Minnesota, where Scarr started working with [[Richard A. Weinberg]], on the [[Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study]]. This study concluded that black and interracial children adopted early into white homes had IQ and school achievement scores that averaged similar to those of white children.\n\nIn another adoption study, [[Minnesota Adolescent Adoption Study]], Scarr and Weinberg showed that adolescents, adopted in the first few months of life, did not resemble their adoptive parents or other children adopted into the same family. In Scarr's words: \"Rather than the home environment having a cumulative impact across development, its influence ''wanes'' from early childhood to adolescence.\" (emphasis in original).<ref name=\"models\"/> As of 1995, the study was among the largest of its kind in the United States, together with the [[Colorado Adoption Project]] and the [[Texas Adoption Project]];<ref name=\"Rowe1995\">{{cite book |author=[[David C.

Kimberly Seelbrede is a licensed psychotherapist in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Kimberly holds a graduate degree from [[New York University]] (NYU) and an undergraduate BA in [[Psychology]].\n\nFollowing the pageant, Kimberly embarked on a career in television, commercials and print modeling.  She made numerous appearances in soap operas, appeared in national and regional commercials and print ads.  Kim signed a lucrative contract as the Sony Beta Movie Spokesperson where she appeared in posters and television advertisements. In 1982, Kimberly was asked to pose for Playboy but declined.\n\nIn 1981, Kimberly Seelbrede met her future husband Neil Cole during the Miss Universe pageant in New York City, New York.  Candie's was an official footwear sponsor of the pageant during which Seelbrede represented the company as a spokesperson. The couple married in 1985 and later divorced in 2001, and have two children together.\n\nSeelbrede, who hails from [[Germantown, Ohio]] won the [[Miss Ohio USA]] pageant in late 1980.  She represented her state at the nationally televised 1981 [[Miss USA]] pageant that was held in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] in May 1981, where she became the second woman from Ohio to win the Miss USA title.\n\nSeelbrede later competed at the [[Miss Universe]] pageant held in New York City in July 1981.  This was the first time the pageant had been held in the United States for ten years: the pageant had been staged internationally for the previous decade after originally being held in the United States for the first twenty years of the pageant's existence.  Seelbrede placed in the semi-finals at the pageant, which was won by [[Irene Saez]] of [[Miss Venezuela|Venezuela]].  Her relatively low placement was somewhat unexpected, as she was in the lead in the earliest portion of the contest then fell to second in the preliminary competition. There was speculation that a judge was instructed by a pageant official to give Seelbrede the lowest possible score in an effort to keep her from placing in the finals.\n\nThe host of the 1981 Miss Universe pageant, [[Bob Barker]], has been criticized for his sarcastic manner during the interview round.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050310103120/http://www.geocities.com/pageantmania2000a/1981Irene.html  PageantMania: Miss Universe 1981] (accessed 31 May 2006)</ref>  It has been speculated that Seelbrede's failure to advance into the finals during the main competition was due to his sardonic questioning about the \u201cexciting\u201d places that she had visited since becoming Miss USA in May that year.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050602074745/http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/9699/80sdisha.html  The Dish On The Universe: The 80's - Part One] (accessed 31 May 2006</ref>\n\nSeelbrede was the second Miss Ohio USA to win the national title, the first being [[Sue Downey|Sue Ann Downey]] in 1965.\n\nShe received advanced post-graduate training in psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as well as advanced EMDRIA approved EMDR training, Brainspotting, DBT skills training, Life Coach training, Mindfulness and specialized Couples Therapy training from The Gottman Institute.

Her research on children\u2019s play included working with Jean Piaget.\n   \n==Sara Smilansky and Jean Piaget==\n\nSara Smilansky worked with [[Jean Piaget]] which led to their development of what they called as the three categories of play.  These categories of play included: sensorimotor play, symbolic play, and games with rules.  Sensorimotor play is where children use their sensorimotor skills to explore their surroundings.<ref name=\"Basic Introduction\">{{cite journal|last1=State of New South Wales, Department of Education and Training|title=A Basic Introduction to Child Development Theories|date=2006|pages=10\u201312|url=http://lrrpublic.cli.det.nsw.edu.au/lrrSecure/Sites/LRRView/7401/documents/theories_outline.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>  Symbolic play is play where children use symbols to represent another object or thing.  Games with rules is when children play and are now able to follow rules and understand that there are certain rules for how certain things are played.  Smilansky added to Piaget's definition of constructive play by adding that constructive play had a visual element resulting from children's play<ref name=Waite-Stupiansky>{{cite book|last1=Waite-Stupiansky|first1=Sandra|title=Building Understanding Together: A Constructivist Approach to Early Childhood Education|date=1997|publisher=Delmar Publishers|isbn=0-8273-6835-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BtK15Z_cOi0C&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=israeli+psychologist+smilansky&source=bl&ots=akFxE4j7iF&sig=pBsTJ2du4c2LGYDHIEDa2cGEFqQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l-JaVOfXGcSzogSwzYGgBg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=israeli%20psychologist%20smilansky&f=false|accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Smilanksy's Four Types of Play==\n\nSara Smilansky focused her research on children\u2019s play, how they learn through play, and how it relates to their future success.  One of Smilansky's main findings in her research was that children engage in four types of play: functional play, conditional play, games with rules, and dramatic play.<ref name=\"Facilitating Play\">{{cite book|last1=Smilansky|first1=Sara|last2=Shefatya|first2=Leah|title=Facilitating Play|date=1990|publisher=Psychosocial & Educational Publications|location=Gaithersburg, MD|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>  Functional play is play where children engage in activities that utilize muscles or the sensorimotor.  Smilansky and Shefatya said that functional play is \u201cbased on children\u2019s need to activate his physical organism\u201d.<ref name=\"Facilitating Play\"/>  Conditional play starts around early childhood and lasts until adulthood and involves sensorimotor activities, where children begin using their creativity.  Following conditional play is games with rules which include two categories: table games and physical games.  Games with rules allow children to understand the idea of rules, accept the rules, and play by the rules.<ref name=\"Facilitating Play\"/>  Last is dramatic play which Smilansky and Shefatya described as the most mature type of play.  This is where children begin to understand their surroundings and begin to imitate what they see.  They concluded that these types of play have effects on the future academic success of children.\n\n==Sociodramatic Play==\n\nOne of Smilansky's research focused on sociodramatic play and its importance on children's learning.  She said sociodramatic play is \u201ca form of voluntary social play activity in which preschool children participate\u201d.<ref name=\"Effects of Sociodramatic Play\">{{cite book|last1=Smilansky|first1=Sara|title=The Effects of Sociodramatic Play on Disadvantaged Preschool Children|date=1968|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=United States}}</ref>  Sociodramatic play is also considered as dramatic play children engage in at a social setting.<ref name=McGraw>{{cite book|last1=McGraw|title=Children Understanding the World Through Play: Play is the Answer to the Question, How Does Anything New Ever Come About?|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/dl/free/0073378488/791932/cas78488_Ch04pp95_125_R.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref>  Sociodramatic play occurs as early as age three in children, but the elements can be seen earlier.  This type of play includes two elements: imitative and imaginative.  Imitative is when the child imitates a real person and a real situation.,<ref name=\"Effects of Sociodramatic Play\"/> which includes imitation of the actions and speech of a person or thing.  Imaginative is when children use their imagination to create what they are imitating.  Imaginative is needed to work best which allows children's imitation of real-life events realistic and possible.  Due to their reality, children are unable to fully imitate the person or situation.<ref name=\"Effects of Sociodramatic Play\"/>  Children use both these elements for  sociodramatic play, which has been concluded to be helpful for children because it prepares them for school.\n\n===Effects of Sociodramatic Play===\n\nSmilansky studied the effects of sociodramatic play on children both advantaged and disadvantaged.  One of her main conclusions is that advantaged children have better speech.  This study was an observational research on 36 preschool children.  18 of these children came from a middle to high class background, while the other 18 came from a lower-class background.  Advantaged children participated more in sociodramatic play than disadvantaged children.  Advantaged children tended to \"speak more, in longer sentences, and in longer utterances; use a higher percentage of nouns, adverbs, and numbers; use fewer adjectives, conjunctions, and pronouns; and have a richer vocabulary\".<ref name=\"Effects of Sociodramatic Play\"/>  Advantaged children also demonstrated sociodramatic play, while disadvantaged children lacked sociodramatic play at age three.  Smilansky also compared cultural differences between children and found that children with North African and Middle Eastern parents suffered intellectually and socially in comparison to those with European parents.<ref name=\"Development of Play\">{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=David|title=The Development of Play|date=1993|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=London|edition=2nd}}</ref> Overall, sociodramatic play has an effect on both advantaged and disadvantaged preschool children.\n\n==Sociodramatic Play and the Four Types of Play==\n\nSociodramatic play and the four types of play are key components of children's play and its effects on learning.  Sociodramatic play includes rules and expectations children have learned through their experiences that allow them to adapt to their peers when playing in a social setting.<ref name=CFC>{{cite web|title=CFC Curriculum|url=http://mps.millvillenj.gov/Page/308|website=Child Family Center|publisher=Schoolwires, Inc|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref>  Similarly, games with rules, one of the four types of play, is when children learn about rules on how certain games are played and understand that these rules have to be followed.  These types of play can be seen not only when a child is playing on their own, but also apparent in social group settings, or sociodramatic play.  Sociodramatic play allows Smilansky's four types of play to come into place.  For example, children can use their sensorimotor skills, skills found during functional play, during sociodramatic play.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nSmilansky's research greatly contributed to the world of psychology, especially [[developmental psychology]].  It greatly impacted research on the effects of play and learning.  Her research allowed for great insight into different types of effects of play on children with different cultural and financial backgrounds.  The results of her research and research she's contributed to says that sociodramatic play allows for preparation for children's school years.  It was also found that the type of background children come from has an effect on sociodramatic play, which affects their learning and academics.\n\n==Works==\n\n*1968 The Effects of Sociodramatic Play on Disadvantaged Preschool Children\n*1988 Clay in the Classroom: Helping Children Develop Cognitive and Affective Skills for Learning\n*1988 On Death: Helping Children Understand and Cope\n*1990 Facilitating Play: A Medium for Promoting Cognitive, Socio-Emotional and Academic Development in Young Children\n*1990 Children's Play and Learning: Perspectives and Policy Implications\n*1992 Dramatic Play: A Practical Guide for Teaching Young Children (Learning Through Play)\n*1992 Twins and Their Development: The Roles of Family and Schools\n*1992 Children of Divorce: The Roles of Family and School\n*2004 Facilitating Play: A Medium for Promoting Cognitive, Socio-Economic and Academic Development\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smilansky, Sara}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Israeli psychologists]]\n[[Category:Developmental psychologists]]\n[[Category:Tel Aviv University faculty]]\n[[Category:Women psychologists]]\n[[Category:20th-century women scientists]]"}]},"34580441":{"pageid":34580441,"ns":0,"title":"May Smith (psychologist)","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox person\n| name          = May Smith\n| image         = <!-- just the filename, without the File: or Image: prefix or enclosing [[brackets]] -->\n| alt           = \n| caption       = \n| birth_name    = <!-- only use if different from name -->\n| birth_date    = 29 August 1879\n| birth_place   = [[Hulme]], England\n| death_date    = {{Death-date and age|21 February 1968|29 August 1879}}\n| death_place   = London, England\n| nationality   = \n| other_names   = \n| occupation    = Psychologist\n| years_active  =\n| known_for     = Experimental research in the field of industrial psychology\n| notable_works =\n}}\n'''May Smith''' {{post-nominals|OBE}} (29 August 1879 \u2013 22 February 1968) was a British [[psychologist]].
