She lectured frequently on her travels and illustrated her talks with color slides and movies. \n[[File:Harriet Chalmers Adams in the Gobi desert.jpg|thumb|right|Harriet Chalmers Adams in the [[Gobi Desert]]]]\n\n\n\n==Life and travels==\n\nBorn in [[Stockton, California]] to Alexander Chalmers and Frances Wilkens. On October 5, 1899 she married Franklin Pierce Adams.<ref name=\"Leonard1914\"/> In 1904, Adams went on her first major expedition, a three-year trip around South America with her husband, during which they visited every country, and traversed the [[Andes]] on horseback. The [[New York Times]] wrote that she \"reached twenty frontiers previously unknown to white women.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn a later trip she retraced the trail of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s early discoveries in the Americas, and crossed [[Haiti]] on horseback.<ref name=\"Live\">{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/8-unsung-women-explorers-180658286.html |title=8 Unsung Women Explorers |author=Our Amazing Planet Staff |publisher=LiveScience.com |date=April 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAdams served as a correspondent for [[Harper's Magazine]] in [[Europe]] during [[World War I]]. She was the only female journalist permitted to visit the trenches.<ref name=\"Live\"/> Later{{when|date=April 2013}} she and her husband visited eastern [[Bolivia]] during a second extended trip to South America.\n\nFrom 1907 to 1935, she wrote twenty-one articles for the National Geographic Society that featured her photographs, including \"Some Wonderful Sights in the Andean Highlands\" (September 1908), \"Kaleidoscopic La Paz: City of the Clouds\" (February 1909) and \"River-Encircled Paraguay\" (April 1933). She wrote on [[Trinidad]], [[Surinam]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and the trans-Andean railroad between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Valparaiso]].\n\nIn 1925, Adams helped launch the [[Society of Woman Geographers]]. In all, Adams is said to have travelled more than a hundred thousand miles, and captivated hundreds of audiences. The New York Times wrote \"Harriet Chalmers Adams is America's greatest woman explorer. As a lecturer no one, man or woman, has a more magnetic hold over an audience than she.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nShe died in [[Nice]], [[France]], on July 17, 1937, at age 61. An obituary in the [[Washington Post]] called her a \"confidant of savage head hunters\"{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} who never stopped wandering the remote corners of the world. She is interred at the [[Chapel of the Chimes (Oakland, California)|Chapel of the Chimes]] in [[Oakland, California]].<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6609443 Adams at Find A Grave website]</ref>\n\nOf women as adventurers, she wrote \n:''I've wondered why men have so absolutely monopolized the field of exploration. Why did women never go to the [[Arctic]], try for one pole or the other, or invade Africa, [[Tibet|Thibet]], or unknown wildernesses? I\u2019ve never found my sex a hinderment; never faced a difficulty which a woman, as well as a man, could not surmount; never felt a fear of danger; never lacked courage to protect myself.

Between them, Beckwith and Fisher have published 14 books, and have had their photos appear in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]], [[Natural History]], [[African Arts]], [[The Observer Magazine]], [[Time (magazine)|Time]], [[Life (magazine)|Life]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], [[Marie Claire]]'' and ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]''. They continue to exhibit and lecture at galleries and museums worldwide, including [[The American Museum of Natural History]] and [[The Explorers Club]] in New York City, [[The Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC, and the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London.<ref>[http://www.aladafrica.org/about_us.htm/ Alad]</ref> They have also collaborated on four films about African traditions.

After obtaining her degree in Painting and Photography, she won a traveling fellowship from the [[Boston Museum]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=May 2013}}, which let her travel to other countries for the first time. She spent seven months in Japan, living in a [[Zen]] temple and studying calligraphic painting. She continued to travel through Southeast Asia and [[New Guinea]], where she witnessed a \"[[sing-sing]]\", a gathering of 90,000 Highland warriors, in [[Mount Hagen]], and paddled up [[Chambri Lakes]] in a canoe, an experience she called \"one of the most wonderful, and in a way formative, experiences in my life.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nHer first trip to Africa was in 1973, when she was invited to spend Christmas with a friend in [[Kenya]]. Beckwith bought a 45-day roundtrip ticket and ended up staying eight months. There she encountered the [[Maasai people]] who invited her to witness a [[female circumcision]] ceremony. Astonished by the ritual, she then determined to spend more time with the Maasai.<ref>\"An Interview with Carol Beckwith\", ''African Arts'', Vol. 18, No. 4 (Aug. 1985), pp. 38\u201345.</ref>\n\n===Career===\nBeckwith studied photography in college but had initially intended to become a painter. It was during her travels through New Guinea that she realized the advantages of photography, saying that \"there was such a vast amount of exciting material that I began to photograph instead, approaching photography with the eye of a painter in terms of light, color, composition. I wanted the images to be multilayered experiences in a way that a painting is. . . [Photography] seemed to be a more suitable medium for the pace of travel.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nBeckwith's first major collaboration was with Tepilit Ole Saitoti, an [[anthropologist]] and former Maasai warrior whom she met in Boston during one of her painting exhibitions. Their collaboration produced the book ''Maasai'' ([[Abrams Books|Abrams]], 1980). She also collaborated with anthropologist Marion van Offelen to produce ''Nomads of Niger'' ([[Abrams Books|Abrams]], 1983), a monograph on the [[Wodaabe]] cattle herders. Although she did not have formal training in [[anthropology]], through working alone as well as with other anthropologists such as Saitoti, van Offelen and Linda Donley-Reid, she \"was able to absorb techniques of interviewing, to learn what questions to ask in order to explore the many aspects of traditional African life.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Collaboration with Angela Fisher===\nBeckwith first heard about Angela Fisher through Fisher's brother Simon in 1974, during a hot air balloon ride in Maasai country. They met during Fisher's exhibition of traditional African jewelry in Nairobi, where they discovered they shared a passion for documenting traditional African cultures. Within one week, they were photographing a Maasai warrior ceremony together.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1020_041020_africa_faces.html \"Faces of Africa\" Photographers on Their 30-Year Endeavor]</ref> \n\nDuring more than three decades of collaboration, they produced ''African Ark'' (Abrams, 1990), ''African Ceremonies'' (Abrams, 1999), ''Passages'' (Abrams, 2000), ''Surma'' (Taller Experimental, 2002), ''Karo'' (Taller Experimental, 2002), ''Maasai, Himba, Hamar'' (Taller Experimental, 2002), ''Faces of Africa'' (Abrams, 2004), ''Lamu: Kenya\u2019s Enchanted Island'' (Abrams, 2009), and ''Dinka'' (Abrams, 2010). They are currently (2011) working on completing their pan-African study of the art of [[body painting]] for a book entitled ''Africa: Spirit of Paint'', as well as on their third and final installation of ''African Ceremonies'', titled ''African Twilight'', scheduled for publication in 2013.

Gertrude Bell was just three at the time, and the death led to a lifelong close relationship with her father, [[Sir Hugh Bell, 2nd Baronet]], who was three times mayor of [[Middlesbrough]] (1874, 1883 and 1911), [[High Sheriff of Durham]] (1895), [[Justice of the Peace]], [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of County Durham and [[Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire]]. Throughout her life she consulted with him on political matters.  Some biographies say the loss of her mother had caused underlying childhood trauma, revealed through periods of depression and risky behaviour.\n\nAt the age of seven Bell acquired a stepmother, [[Florence Bell]], and eventually, three half-siblings. Florence Bell was a playwright and author of children's stories, as well as the author of a study of Bell factory workers. She instilled concepts of duty and decorum in Gertrude and contributed to her intellectual development. Florence Bell's activities with the wives of [[Bolckow Vaughan]] ironworkers in [[Eston]], near [[Middlesbrough]], may have helped influence her step-daughter's later stance promoting education of Iraqi women.<ref>O'Brien, pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\nGertrude Bell received her early education from [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] in London and then later at [[Lady Margaret Hall]], [[Oxford University]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Alumni/Prominent-alumni.aspx | title=LMH, Oxford - Prominent Alumni|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref> at the age of 17. History was one of the few subjects women were allowed to study, due to the many restrictions imposed on them at the time. She specialised in modern history, in which she received a [[first class honours degree]] in two years.\n\nBell never married or had children. She befriended British colonial administrator Sir [[Frank Swettenham]] on a visit to Singapore with her brother Hugo in 1903 and maintained a correspondence with him until 1909.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barlow |first=Henry S. |date=1995 |title=Swettenham |location=Kuala Lumpur |publisher=Southdene |pages=654\u20135}}</ref> She had a \"brief but passionate affair\" with Swettenham following his retirement to England in 1904.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barlow |first=Henry S. |title=Malaysia: Swettenham's Legacy |journal=Asian Affairs |volume=28 |issue=3 |page=333 |date=1997}}</ref> She also had an unconsummated affair with [[Major (United Kingdom)|Maj.]] [[Charles Doughty-Wylie]], a married man, with whom she exchanged love letters from 1913 to 1915.<ref>Lukitz, 2006. pp. 14\u201317</ref> After his death in 1915 during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], Bell launched herself into her work.\n\n==Travels and writings==\nBell's uncle, Sir [[Frank Lascelles (diplomat)|Frank Lascelles]], was British minister ([[Minister (diplomacy)#Ranks|similar to ambassador]]) at [[Tehran]], [[Persia]]. In May 1892, after leaving Oxford, Bell travelled to [[Persia]] to visit him. She described this journey in her book, ''Persian Pictures'', which was published in 1894. She spent much of the next decade travelling around the world, [[mountaineering]] in Switzerland, and developing a passion for archaeology and languages. She had become fluent in Arabic, Persian, French and German as well as also speaking Italian and Turkish. In 1899, Bell again went to the Middle East. She visited [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Syria]] that year and in 1900, on a trip from [[Jerusalem]] to Damascus, she became acquainted with the [[Druze]] living in [[Jabal al-Druze]].<ref name=\"Gertrude Bell and the Birth of Iraq\">{{cite web|url=http://theava.com/04/0526-gertrude-bell.html |title=Gertrude Bell and the Birth of Iraq |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023092937/http://theava.com/04/0526-gertrude-bell.html |archivedate=23 October 2004 }}</ref> She travelled across Arabia six times over the next 12 years.<ref name=\"Gertrude Bell and the Birth of Iraq\"/>\n\nBetween 1899 and 1904, she conquered a number of mountains including the La [[Meije]] and [[Mont Blanc]] as she recorded 10 new paths or first ascents in the [[Bernese Alps]]. One Alpine peak in the [[Bernese Oberland]], the {{convert|2632|m|ft|abbr=on}} Gertrudspitze, was named after her after it was first traversed by her and her guides Ulrich and Heinrich Fuhrer in 1901. However, she did fail in an attempt of the [[Finsteraarhorn]] in August 1902 when inclement weather including snow, hail and lightning forced her to spend \"forty eight hours on the rope\" with her guides, clinging to the rock face in terrifying conditions which nearly cost her her life.<ref>Helen Berry: BBC History Magazine September 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:BinbirkiliseBell.jpg|thumb|280px|upright=1.3|Bell's workers at the [[Binbirkilise]] excavations in 1907]]\nShe published her observations in the book ''Syria: The Desert and the Sown'' published in 1907 (William Heinemann Ltd, London). In this book she described, photographed and detailed her trip to Greater [[Syria]]'s towns and cities like [[Damascus]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Beirut]], [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandretta]]. Bell's vivid descriptions opened up the Arabian [[deserts]] to the western world. In March 1907, Bell journeyed to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and began to work with the archaeologist and [[New Testament]] scholar Sir [[William M. Ramsey]]. Their excavations in [[Binbirkilise]] were chronicled in ''A Thousand and One Churches''.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.de/books?id=WRqqcOMUkz8C&pg=PA167&dq=binbirkilise&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=4#v=onepage&q=binbirkilise&f=false bei GoogleBooks |title=Breaking Ground: Pioneering Women Archaeologists |authors=Cohen, Getzel M. et Martha Sharp Joukowsky |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2006 |page=167 |isbn=978-0-472-03174-0 }}</ref> In 1907, they discovered a field of ruins in northern Syria on the east bank of the upper course of the Euphrates to the steep slope of the former river valley.

She visited the [[hittites|Hittite]] city of [[Carchemish]], mapped and described the ruin of [[Ukhaidir]] and finally went to [[Babylon]] and [[Najaf]]. Back in Carchemish, she consulted with the two archaeologists on site. One of them was [[T. E. Lawrence]]. Her 1913 Arabian journey was generally difficult. She was the second foreign woman after [[Lady Anne Blunt]] to visit [[Ha'il]].\n\nIn 1927, a year after her death, her stepmother [[Florence Bell|Dame Florence Bell]] published two volumes of Bell's collected correspondence written during the 20 years preceding [[World War I]].<ref name=\"letters\" />\n\n==War and political career==\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]], Bell's request for a Middle East posting was initially denied. She instead volunteered with the [[Red Cross]] in France.\n\nLater, she was asked by [[British Intelligence]] to get soldiers through the deserts, and from the World War I period until her death she was the only woman holding political power and influence in shaping British imperial policy in the Middle East. She often acquired a team of locals which she directed and led on her expeditions. Throughout her travels Bell established close relations with tribe members across the Middle East. Additionally, being a woman gave her exclusive access to the chambers of wives of tribe leaders, giving her access to other perspectives and functions.\n\n===Work in the Middle East: From Basra to Bagdad===\n[[File:Harry St. John Bridger Philby.jpg|thumb|199px|St John Philby]]\nIn November 1915, however she was summoned to [[Cairo]] to the nascent [[Arab Bureau]], headed by General [[Gilbert Clayton]]. She also again met [[T. E. Lawrence]].<ref>Howell, 2008. pp 160\u2013161.</ref>\n\nLike Lawrence, Bell had attended Oxford and earned [[British undergraduate degree classification|First Class Honours]] in Modern History.  Bell spoke Arabic, Persian, French and German.  She was an archaeologist, traveller and photographer in the Middle East before World War I.  Upon the recommendation of renowned archaeologist and historian Lt. Cmdr. [[David George Hogarth|David Hogarth]], first Lawrence, then Bell, were assigned to Army Intelligence Headquarters in Cairo in 1915 for war service. Because both Bell and Lawrence had travelled the desert and established ties with the local tribes and gained unique perspectives of the people and the land before World War I, Hogarth realised the value of Lawrence and Bell's expertise.  Both Bell and Lawrence stood hardly 5'5\", yet both could ride with great determination and endurance through the desert for hours on end.\n\nArriving in February 1916, she did not, at first, receive an official position, but instead helped Hogarth set about organising and processing her own, Lawrence's and [[William Shakespear (explorer)|Capt. W. H. I. Shakespear]]'s data about the location and disposition of [[Arab]] tribes that could be encouraged to join the British against the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence and the British used the information in forming alliances with the Arabs.\n\nOn 3 March 1916, Gen. Clayton abruptly sent Bell to [[Basra]], which British forces had captured in November 1914, to advise Chief Political Officer [[Percy Cox]] regarding an area she knew better than any other Westerner.  Cox found her an office in his headquarters, where she was employed for the two days per week she was not at Military GHQ Basra.<ref>...He is going to give me a room in his office where I shall go two or three mornings a week... the other days I shall go on working at GHQ....Sir Percy's office is a quarter of an hour away. To Herbert Baker, Basrah, June 25th 1916, Letters, vol.1, p.379</ref> She drew maps to help the British army reach [[Baghdad]] safely.  She became the only female [[political officer (British Empire)|political officer]] in the British forces and received the title of \"Liaison Officer, Correspondent to Cairo\" (i.e. to the Arab Bureau where she had been assigned). She was [[St. John Philby]]'s field controller, and taught him the finer arts of behind-the-scenes political manoeuvering.\n\n{{quotation|I went out last week along the light railway 25 miles into the desert it's the Nasariyeh Railway - ...it was so curious to travel 50 minutes by rail and find...General Maude, our new army commander, has just arrived.

London: Alfred Knopf, 2005. p. 327 ISBN 1-84115-007-X</ref>}}\n\nAfter British troops took Baghdad on 10 March 1917, Bell was summoned by Cox to Baghdad<ref>Howell, 2008. pp 274\u2013276.</ref> and given the title of \"Oriental Secretary.\" She, Cox and Lawrence were among a select group of \"Orientalists\" convened by [[Winston Churchill]] to attend a [[Cairo Conference (1921)|1921 Conference in Cairo]] to determine the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|boundaries of the British mandate]] (e.g., \"the British Partitions\") and nascent states such as Iraq.<ref name=HowellConf>Howell, 2008. pp 365\u2013369.</ref> Gertrude is supposed to have described Lawrence as being able \"to ignite fires in cold rooms\".\n\nThroughout the conference, she, Cox and Lawrence worked tirelessly to promote the establishment of the countries of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] and Iraq to be presided over by the Kings [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]], sons of the instigator of the [[Arab Revolt]] against the Ottoman Empire (ca. 1915\u20131916), [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]], Sharif and Emir of Mecca.<ref name=HowellConf/> Until her death in Baghdad, she served in the Iraq British High Commission advisory group there.\n\nAnother target of her efforts was thwarting the ambitions of Zionist movement. Gertrude Bell's hostility towards Zionism was as passionate as her advocacy of the Arab cause - she thought the Jews had no place in Palestine.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3655036/Putting-the-dons-on-their-mettle.html</ref>\n\nReferred to by Persians as \"al-Khatun\" (a Lady of the Court who keeps an open eye and ear for the benefit of the State), she was a confidante of King Faisal of Iraq and helped ease his passage into the role, amongst Iraq's other tribal leaders at the start of his reign. He helped her to found Baghdad's great [[National Museum of Iraq|Iraqi Archaeological Museum]] from her own modest artefact collection and to establish The British School of Archaeology, Iraq, for the endowment of excavation projects from proceeds in her will. The stress of authoring a prodigious output of books, correspondence, intelligence reports, reference works, and white papers; of recurring bronchitis attacks brought on by years of heavy smoking in the company of English and Arab cohorts; of bouts with malaria; and finally, of coping with Baghdad's summer heat all took a toll on her health. Somewhat frail to start with, she became nearly emaciated.\n\nSome consider the present troubles in Iraq are derived from the political boundaries Bell conceived, to create its borders. Perhaps so, but her reports indicate that problems were foreseen, and that it was clearly understood that there were just not many (if any) permanent solutions for calming the divisive forces at work in that part of the world.<ref name=HowellEnd>Howell, 2008. pp 413\u2013419.</ref>\n\n[[Mark Sykes]], the British diplomat responsible for the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]], was not fond of her. He once described her as {{quotation|\"conceited, gushing, flat-chested, man-woman, globe-trotting, rumpwagging, blethering ass.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/museums/10651309/How-Gertrude-Bell-caused-a-desert-storm.html|title=How Gertrude Bell caused a desert storm|accessdate=2016-06-10|date=2014-02-21|work=The Telegraph}}</ref>}}\n\n===Creation of Iraq===\nAs the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire was finalised by the end of the war in late January 1919, Bell was assigned to conduct an analysis of the situation in Mesopotamia. Due to her familiarity and relations with the tribes in the area she had strong ideas about the leadership needed in Iraq. She spent the next ten months writing what was later considered a masterly official report, \"Self Determination in Mesopotamia\".<ref>Sheth, Jagdish & Sobel, Andrew. Clients for Life. Location (Kindle) 4480)</ref> The British Commissioner in Mesopotamia, [[Arnold Wilson]], had different ideas of how Iraq should be run, preferring an Arab government to be under the influence of British officials who would retain real control, as he felt, from experience, that Mesopotamian populations were not yet ready to govern and administer the country efficiently and peacefully.\n\nOn 11 October 1920, [[Percy Cox]] returned to Baghdad and asked her to continue as Oriental Secretary, acting as liaison with the forthcoming Arab government. Gertrude Bell essentially played the role of mediator between the Arab government and British officials. Bell often had to mediate between the various groups of Iraq including a majority population of Shias in the southern region, Sunnis in central Iraq, and the Kurds, mostly in the northern region, who wished to be autonomous. Keeping these groups united was essential for political balance in Iraq and for British imperial interests. Iraq not only contained valuable resources in oil but would act as a buffer zone, with the help of Kurds in the north as a standing army in the region to protect against [[Turkey]], Persia (Iran), and Syria.  British officials in London, especially Churchill, were highly concerned about cutting heavy costs in the colonies, including the cost of quashing tribal infighting.  Another important project for both the British and new Iraqi rulers was creating a new identity for these people so that they would identify themselves as one nation.<ref name=Wallach6/>\n\nBritish officials quickly realised that their strategies in governing were adding to costs. Iraq would be cheaper as a self-governing state. The [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo Conference of 1921]] was held to determine the political and geographic structure of what later became Iraq and the modern Middle East.<ref>Howell, 2008, pp.365-369.</ref> Significant input was given by Gertrude Bell in these discussions thus she was an essential part of its creation. At the Cairo Conference Bell and Lawrence highly recommended [[Faisal bin Hussein]], (the son of Hussein, [[Sherif of Mecca]]), former commander of the Arab forces that helped the British during the war and entered Damascus at the culmination of the Arab Revolt. He had been recently deposed by France as King of Syria, and British officials at the Cairo Conference decided to make him the first king of Iraq.  They believed that due to his lineage as a Hashemite and his diplomatic skills he would be respected and have the ability to unite the various groups in the country. Shias would respect him because of his lineage from [[Muhammad]]. Sunnis, including Kurds, would follow him because he was Sunni from a respected family.  Keeping all the groups under control in Iraq was essential to balance the political and economic interests of the British Empire.\n\nUpon Faisal's arrival in 1921, Bell advised him in local questions, including matters involving tribal geography and local business. She also supervised the selection of appointees for cabinet and other leadership posts in the new government.\n\nThroughout the early 1920s Bell was an integral part of the administration of Iraq. The new Hashemite monarchy used the Sharifian flag, which consisted of a black stripe representing the [[Abbasid caliphate]], white stripe representing the [[Umayyad caliphate]], and a green stripe for [[Fatimid Dynasty]], and lastly a red triangle to set across the three bands symbolising Islam. Bell felt it essential to customise it for Iraq by adding a gold star to the design.<ref>Lukitz,2006. p. 149</ref> Faisal was crowned king of Iraq on 23 August 1921, but he was not completely welcomed. Utilizing Shi'ite history to gain support for Faisal, during the holy month of [[Muharram]], Bell compared Faisal's arrival in Baghdad to Husayn, grandson of Muhammad.\n\nHowever, she did not find working with the new king to be easy: \"You may rely upon one thing&nbsp;\u2014 I'll never engage in creating kings again; it's too great a strain.\" <ref>{{Cite web|title=The Letters.

The Baghdad Peace Library (''Maktabat al-Salam'') was a private, subscription library, but in c.1924 was taken over by the Ministry of Education and became known as the Baghdad Public Library (or sometimes as the General Library). In 1961, this became the [[Iraq National Library and Archive|National Library of Iraq]].\n\n===Baghdad Archaeological Museum===\n{{further|National Museum of Iraq}}\n\nGertrude Bell's first love had always been archaeology, thus she began forming what became the Baghdad Archaeological Museum, later renamed the [[National Museum of Iraq|Iraqi Museum]]. Her goal was to preserve Iraqi culture and history which included the important relics of Mesopotamian civilisations, and keep them in their country of origin. She also supervised excavations and examined finds and artefacts. She brought in extensive collections, such as from the Babylonian Empire.<ref name=Wallach6/> The museum was officially opened in June 1926, shortly before Bell's death. After her death, at the Emir's suggestion, the right wing of the Museum was named as a memorial to her.\n\n==Death==\nBell briefly returned to Britain in 1925, and found herself facing family problems and ill health. Her family's fortune had begun to decline due to the onset of post-World War I worker strikes in Britain and economic depression in Europe. She returned to Baghdad and soon developed [[pleurisy]]. When she recovered, she heard that her younger half brother Hugh had died of [[typhoid]].\n\nOn 12 July 1926, Bell was discovered dead, of an apparent overdose of sleeping pills. There is much debate on her death, but it is unknown whether the overdose was an intentional suicide or accidental since she had asked her maid to wake her.<ref name=Wallach6/>\n\nShe was buried at the British cemetery in Baghdad's Bab al-Sharji district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/mar/12/iraq.jamesbuchan|title=Miss Bell's lines in the sand|last=Buchan|first=James|publisher=The Guardian|date=12 March 2003|accessdate=29 August 2009}}</ref> Her funeral was a major event, attended by large numbers of people including her colleagues, British officials and the King of Iraq.

G. Hogarth]] expressed the respect British officials held for her. Hogarth honoured her by saying,\n\n<blockquote>No woman in recent time has combined her qualities \u2013 her taste for arduous and dangerous adventure with her scientific interest and knowledge, her competence in archaeology and art, her distinguished literary gift, her sympathy for all sorts and condition of men, her political insight and appreciation of human values, her masculine vigour, hard common sense and practical efficiency&nbsp;\u2013 all tempered by feminine charm and a most romantic spirit.<ref>H.D.G. \"Obituary: Gertrude Lowthian Bell\", ''The Geographical Journal'' 68.4 (1926): 363\u2013368.

Her parents were Rev Edward Bird BA (1794-1858) and his second wife,  Dora Lawson (1803-1866).<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Boroughbridge was her father's first curacy after taking orders in 1830, and it was here he met Dora.\n\nBird moved several times during her childhood. In 1832, Reverend Bird was appointed curate in [[Maidenhead]], where Isabella's brother Edward was born and died in his first year. Because of her father's ill health Bird's family moved again in 1834 to [[Tattenhall]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Lucas, Charles Prestwood |title=Bishop, Isabella Lucy |publisher=Dictionary of National Biography |year=1912 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bishop,_Isabella_Lucy_%28DNB12%29}}</ref> in [[Cheshire]], a living presented to him by his cousin [[John Sumner (bishop)|Dr John Bird Sumner, Bishop of Chester]], where in the same year Bird's sister, Henrietta, was born.\n \nBird was outspoken from an early age. When six years old, she confronted the local [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[South Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cheshire]]: \"[[Sir Philip Grey Egerton, 10th Baronet|Sir Malpas de Grey Tatton Egerton]], while he was campaigning, asking him \"did you tell my father my sister was so pretty because you wanted his vote?\"<ref name=\"Stoddart\"/>\n\nEdward Bird's controversial views against Sunday labour caused his congregation to dwindle, and in 1842 he requested a transfer to St. Thomas's in [[Birmingham]]. Here again objections were raised which culminated in the minister's being pelted \"with stones, mud, and  insults\".\n\nIn 1848, the family moved again and, after spending some time in [[Eastbourne]], took up residence in [[Wyton, Cambridgeshire|Wyton]] in Huntingdonshire (now Cambridgeshire.)<ref name=\"Stoddart\">Stoddart, Anna M, (1906) ''The Life of Isabella Bird, Mrs Bishop'' : London, J. Murray OCLC  4138739</ref>\n\nFrom early childhood Bird was frail, suffering from a spinal complaint, nervous headaches, and insomnia.  The doctor recommended an open-air life,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and consequently, Bird learned to ride in infancy, and later to row. Her only education came from her parents:  her father was a keen botanist, and Isabella studied flora with him, and her mother taught her daughters an eclectic mix of subjects. Isabella became an avid reader.<ref name=\"Stoddart\"/>  However, her \"bright intelligence, [and] an extreme curiosity as to the world outside, made it impossible for her brain and her nature generally to be narrowed and stiffened by the strictly evangelical atmosphere of her childhood\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Life of Isabella Bird|journal=The Spectator|date=26 January 1907|pages=6|location=London}}</ref>\n\nBird's first publication was at the age of 16, a pamphlet addressing Free Trade v Protectionism after which she continued writing articles for various periodicals.<ref name=\"Times Obit\"/>\n\nIn 1850, a \"fibrous tumour was removed from the neighbourhood of the spine\".  Bird continued to be unwell, suffering from unspecified ailments resulting in lassitude and insomnia. The family spent six summers in Scotland in an effort to improve her health.\n\nDoctors urged a sea voyage and in 1854 Bird's life of travelling began when the opportunity arose for her to sail to the United States accompanying her second cousins to their family home. Her father \"gave her [\u00a3]100 and leave to stay away as long as it lasted\".<ref name=\"Stoddart\"/>  Bird's \"bright descriptive letters\"<ref name=\"Times Obit\"/> written home to her relations formed the basis for her first book, ''An Englishwoman in America'' (1856),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Englishwoman in America|year=1856|publisher=John Murray OCLC 169934144|author=Bird, Isabella L. }}</ref> published by [[John Murray (publisher)|Murray]].

While there she climbed [[Mauna Kea]] and [[Mauna Loa]].<ref name=bird>{{cite news|author=Bird, Isabella |title=Biographical Note|work=The Hawaiian Archipelago|publisher= eBooks|date=2004|page= i}}</ref> She then moved on to [[Colorado]], then the newest state in the USA, where she had heard the air was excellent for the infirm. Dressed practically and riding not sidesaddle but frontwards like a man (though she threatened to sue the ''Times'' for saying she dressed like one), she covered over 800 miles in the [[Rocky Mountains]] in 1873. Her letters to her sister, first printed in the magazine ''[[The Leisure Hour]]'',<ref name=bird/> comprised Bird's fourth and perhaps most famous book, ''A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains''.\n\nBird's time in the Rockies was enlivened especially by her acquaintance with Jim Nugent, \"[[Rocky Mountain Jim]]\", a textbook outlaw with one eye and an affinity for violence and poetry. \"A man any woman might love but no sane woman would marry\", Bird declared in a section excised from her letters before their publication.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Nugent also seemed captivated by the independent-minded Bird, but she ultimately left the Rockies and her \"dear desperado\". Nugent was shot dead less than a year later.\n\n[[File:PSM V34 D092 Ainu of yezo.jpg|thumb|180px|The illustration of two [[Ainu people|Ainu]] men, originally from her 1880 book ''Unbeaten Tracks in [[Japan]]'']]\nAt home, Bird again found herself pursued, this time by Dr John Bishop, an [[Edinburgh]] surgeon in his thirties. Predictably ill, she went traveling again, this time to Asia: [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Singapore]], and [[Malaysia]]. When her sister Henrietta Amelia Bird died of [[typhoid]] in 1880, Isabella was heartbroken and thereafter accepted John Bishop's marriage proposal. They were married in February 1881.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Bird's health took a severe turn for the worse but recovered following John Bishop's death in 1886, at which point she inherited a  large amount of disposable income. Feeling that her earlier travels had been hopelessly dilettante, Bird studied medicine and resolved to travel as a [[missionary]]. Despite being nearly 60 years of age, she set off for [[India]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Korea and Her Neighbours.png|thumb|200px|right|''Korea and Her Neighbours'' (1898)]]\nArriving on the subcontinent in February 1889, Bird visited missions in [[India]], visited [[Ladakh]] on the borders of [[Tibet]], and then travelled in [[Persia]], [[Kurdistan]], and [[Turkey]]. In India, she worked with [[Fanny Jane Butler]] to found the John Bishop Memorial Hospital in memory of her recently deceased husband. The following year, she joined a group of British soldiers travelling between [[Baghdad]] and [[Tehran]]. She remained with the unit's commanding officer during his survey work in the region, armed with her revolver and a medicine chest supplied \u2013 in possibly an early example of corporate sponsorship \u2013 by [[Henry Wellcome]]'s company in [[London]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nFeatured in journals and magazines for decades, Bird was by now something of a household name. In November 1892, she became the first woman inducted into the [[Royal Geographical Society]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Admission of Women Fellows to the Royal Geographical Society, 1892-1914; the Controversy and the Outcome|url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/3059652|journal = The Geographical Journal|date = 1996-01-01|pages = 295\u2013312|volume = 162|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/3059652|first = Morag|last = Bell|first2 = Cheryl|last2 = McEwan}}</ref> She was elected to membership of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] on 12 January 1897. Her final great journey took place in 1897, when she travelled up the [[Yangtze]] and [[Han River (Korea)|Han]] rivers in [[China]] and [[Korea]], respectively. Later still, she went to [[Morocco]], where she travelled among the [[Berber people|Berbers]] and had to use a ladder to mount her black stallion, a gift from the Sultan.<ref name=bird/>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:The grave of Isabella Bird, Dean Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The grave of Isabella Bird, Dean Cemetery]]\nA few months after returning from a trip to Morocco, Bird fell ill and died at her home on 16 Melville Street, Edinburgh on 7 October 1904. She was buried in the [[Dean Cemetery]] on the west side of [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Her parents, sister and husband Dr John Bishop, an Edinburgh surgeon (who, after his premature death in 1886, had funded her travels through his inheritance), lie with her. The grave lies in the small curved southern section.\n\nShe  was planning another trip to China at the time of her death. \"There never was anybody,\" wrote the Spectator, \"who had adventures as well as Miss Bird\".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Caryl Churchill]] used Bird as a character in her play ''[[Top Girls]]'' (1982). Much of the dialogue written by Churchill comes from Bird's own writings.\n\nBird was featured in ''Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology'' (2006), edited by Lauret E. Savoy, [[Eldridge M. Moores]], and Judith E. Moores ([[Trinity University (Texas)#Trinity University Press|Trinity University Press]]) which looks at writing over the years and how it pays tribute to the Earth and its geological features.<ref>{{cite book|title=2006|authors=Savoy, Lauret E. & [[Eldridge M.

A native of [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]], she and her sister were brought as young children to the United States by their mother about 1850 to escape the poverty of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. The family lived first in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where the girls also worked when old enough, before migrating to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in 1865.\n\nCashman established her first boarding house for miners in British Columbia during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], asking for donations to the [[Sisters of St. Anne]] in return. During her time there, she led a rescue of tens of miners in the [[Cassiar Mountains]].\n\nAfter moving to [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], Arizona, c. 1880, Cashman built the [[Sacred Heart Church (Tombstone, Arizona)|Sacred Heart Catholic Church]], and did charitable work with the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]]. She successfully reared the five children of her sister Fanny after they were orphaned in 1883. In the late 1880s, Cashman set up several restaurants and boardinghouses in Arizona.\n\nIn 1898 she went to the [[Yukon]] for gold prospecting, working there until 1905. She became nationally known as a frontierswoman, with the [[Associated Press]] covering a later trip. In 2006 Cashman was inducted into the [[Alaska Mining Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early years==\nBorn at Belvelly, near [[Cobh]], County Cork in 1845, Cashman was brought to the United States around 1850 by her mother, along with her sister Frances (known as Fanny); they settled first in Boston. As an adolescent, Cashman worked as a bellhop in a Boston hotel. In 1865 she and her family migrated to San Francisco, California.\n\n==British Columbia==\nFollowing the onset of the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], Cashman left her family home in 1874 for the [[Cassiar Mountains]] in British Columbia, Canada. A lifelong Catholic, she set up a boarding house for miners, asking for donations to the [[Sisters of St Anne]] in return for the services available at her boarding house. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}Cashman was travelling to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] to deliver 500 [[US dollar|dollars]] to the sisters of St. Anne when she heard that a [[snowstorm]] had descended on the Cassiar Mountains, stranding and injuring 26 miners, who were also suffering from [[scurvy]]. She took charge of a six-man search party and collected food and medicine to take to the stranded miners. Conditions in the Cassiar Mountains were so dangerous that the [[Canadian Army]] advised against attempting the rescue. Upon learning of Cashman's expedition, a commander sent his troops to locate her party and bring them to safety. An army trooper eventually found Cashman camped on the frozen surface of the [[Stikine River]]. Over tea, she convinced the trooper and his men that it was her will to continue, and that she would not head back without rescuing the miners. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}After 77 days of harsh weather, Cashman and her party located the sick men, who numbered far more than 26. Some historical accounts credit Cashman with saving the lives of as many as 75 men. She administered a diet containing [[Vitamin C]] to restore the men to health. She was afterward fondly known in the region as the \"Angel of the Cassiar\". {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Arizona==\n[[File:NELLIE CASHMAN HOTEL - TOMBSTONE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Nellie Cashman's Hotel in Tombstone]]\nAbout 1880, Cashman moved to [[Tombstone, Arizona]]. She raised money to build the [[Sacred Heart Church (Tombstone, Arizona)|Sacred Heart Catholic Church]], and committed herself to charity work with the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]]. She took a position as a nurse in a [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] hospital but also opened another restaurant and boarding house.\n\nHer sister Fanny (Cashman) Cunningham was widowed in 1881, following the death of her husband Tom, a bootmaker. Cashman arranged for Fanny and her five children to move to nearby [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Fanny died in 1884 of [[tuberculosis]], leaving her children in Cashman's care. Honoring her sister's wishes, Cashman raised the children as her own. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nSoon after her sister's death in 1884, Cashman travelled to [[Baja California]] after hearing rumours of untapped gold and silver deposits. She joined 21 men in a short-lived prospecting venture. Sixteen hours into the 100-mile journey, in conditions of extreme heat and drought, the group had already nearly depleted their water supplies, and most of the men were suffering from [[dehydration]]. They abandoned their venture. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn December 1883, bandits committed the [[Bisbee Massacre]] in Tombstone, killing four innocent bystanders and wounding two others in the course of a robbery. The five men were convicted and sentenced to die by [[hanging]] on 28 March 1884. Many people were eager to make a spectacle of the execution. A local carpenter built a grandstand next to the hanging site, planning to charge for tickets. Cashman was outraged, feeling that no execution should be celebrated. She befriended the five convicts, visiting them to provide spiritual guidance. Cashman convinced the sheriff to set a curfew on the day of the hangings to prevent a crowd from forming. The night before the execution, Cashman and a crew of volunteers tore down the grandstand. The hangings proceeded as scheduled, but out of public view. When Cashman learned that a medical school planned to exhume the bodies of the convicts for study, she enlisted two prospectors to stand watch over the [[Boot Hill]] Cemetery for 10 days. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nCashman and her associate Joseph Pascholy co-owned and ran a restaurant and hotel in Tombstone called Russ House, now known as Nellie Cashman's. According to a popular legend, a client once complained about Cashman's cooking. Fellow diner [[Doc Holliday]] drew his pistol, asking the customer to repeat what he had said. The man said, \"Best I ever ate.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn 1886, Cashman left Tombstone to travel across Arizona, opening restaurants and boarding houses in [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]], [[Jerome, Arizona|Jerome]], [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], and [[Harquahala, Arizona|Harquahala]], near [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Yukon and Alaska==\nIn 1898, Cashman left Arizona for the [[Yukon]] in search of gold, staying until 1905. Her prospecting ventures took her to [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], and [[Nolan Creek, Alaska|Nolan Creek]]. She later owned a store in [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} She settled in [[Koyukuk, Alaska|Koyukuk]], along with other established miners.\n\nIn 1921, Cashman visited California, where she declared her desire to be appointed [[U.S. Marshal|US deputy Marshal]] for the area of [[Koyukuk, Alaska|Koyukuk]]. In 1922, the [[Associated Press]] documented her lengthy trip from Nolan Creek to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn January 1925, Cashman developed [[pneumonia]] and [[rheumatism]]. Friends admitted her to the Sisters of St. Anne, the same hospital which she had helped to build fifty-one years earlier. She died and was interred at [[Ross Bay Cemetery]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]].\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n*The 1959\u20131960 season of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]], ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', with [[Hugh O'Brian]] starring as [[Wyatt Earp]], featured a fictional character based on Nellie Cashman played by actress [[Randy Stuart]].\n*[[Grace Lee Whitney]] played Cashman in \"The Angel of Tombstone\" of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] western series ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] a few months before his own death in 1969. In the story line, Cashman and several men from Tombstone travel to [[Baja California]] in search of [[gold]] found by a [[Mexico|Mexican]] prospector. On reaching the site, Cashman learns how a prosperous Catholic [[Mission (station)|mission]] has been quietly financing its charitable work. [[Gregg Barton]], [[Tris Coffin]], and [[Joaquin Martinez]] also guest starred in this episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0962296/|title=The Angel of Tombstone on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}</ref>\n*On March 15, 2006, Nellie Cashman was inducted [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] into the Alaska Mining Hall of Fame.<ref>[http://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/cashman.php \"Ellen (Nellie) Cashman (1845\u20131925)\"], Alaska Mining Hall of Fame Foundation</ref>\n*In 2007, she was inducted into the [[National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas.\n*In June 2014, a monument in Nellie's honour was erected near her home in [[Midleton]] [[Co.

Louis and Alexandrine had met in Belgium, where the school teacher and publisher of a republican journal was exiled when Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte became emperor. Between the penniless husband and the wife who would not come into her inheritance until after her father would die, the reasons for disagreements grew with the birth of Alexandra. Although her mother wanted her to receive a Catholic education, her father had her secretly baptized in the Protestant faith.\n\nIn 1871, appalled by the execution of the last Communards in front of the Communards' Wall at the ''P\u00e8re-Lachaise'' cemetery in Paris, Louis David took his daughter of two years, Eug\u00e9nie, future Alexandra, there to see and never forget, by this early encounter of the face of death, the ferocity of humans.\n\nIn 1873, the Davids emigrated to Belgium.<ref name=\"Foster_chronology\">{{harvp|Foster|Foster|1998|loc=pp. vii\u2013ix ('Chronology')}}</ref>\n\nSince before the age of 15, she had been exercising a good number of extravagant austerities: fasting, corporal torments, recipes drawn from biographies of ascetic saints found in the library of one of her female relatives, to which she refers to in ''Sous des nu\u00e9es d'orage'', published in 1940.<ref name=\"Brodeur_180\">{{harvp|Brodeur|2001|p=180}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 15, spending her holidays with her parents at Ostende, she ran for and reached the port of [[Vlissingen]] in the Netherlands to try and embark for England. Lack of money forced her to give up.<ref>{{harvp|Reverzy|2001|p=273}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 18, she had already visited England, Switzerland and Spain on her own, and she was studying in [[Madame Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophical Society]]. \"She joined various secret societies \u2013 she would reach the thirtieth degree in the mixed Scottish Rite of [[Freemasonry]] \u2013 while [[feminist]] and anarchist groups greeted her with enthusiasm...\nThroughout her childhood and adolescence, she was associated with the French geographer and anarchist [[Elis\u00e9e Reclus]] (1820\u20131905). This led her to become interested in the anarchistic ideas of the time (Max Stirner, Mikhail Bakunin, etc.) and in feminism, that inspired her to the publication of ''Pour la vie'' (For Life) in 1898. \nIn 1899, she composed an anarchist treatise with a preface by [[Elis\u00e9e Reclus]].

But on the other hands, she rejected certain positions advocated during those meetings (for example the right to vote), preferring the struggle for economic emancipation. She distanced herself for that matter from these \"lovely birds, with precious plumage\", in reference to those feminists coming mainly from the high society, forgetting the economic battle in which most women are bound.\n\nAccording to Raymond Brodeur, she converted to Buddhism in 1889, which she noted in her diary that was published under the title ''La Lampe de sagesse'' (The Lamp of Wisdom) in 1986. She was 21 years old. That same year, to refine her English, an indispensable language for an orientalist's career, she went to London where she frequented the library of the British Museum and, moreover, made the acquaintance of several members of the Theosophical Society. The following year, back in Paris, she initiated herself to Sanskrit and Tibetan and followed different instructions at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and at the Ecole pratique des hautes Etudes (practical school of high studies) without ever passing an exam there.<ref>{{harvp|Brodeur|2001|pp=180\u2013182}}</ref> According to Jean Chalon, her vocation to be an orientalist and Buddhist originated at the [[Guimet Museum]].<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|pp=63\u201364}}</ref>\n\n===1895\u20131904: opera singer===\nAt the suggestion of her father, David-N\u00e9el attended the Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles (Royal Conservatory of Brussels), where she studied piano and singing.<ref>{{harvp|Kuhlman|2002}}</ref> To help her parents who were experiencing setbacks, David-N\u00e9el, who had obtained a first prize for singing, took the position of first singer at the [[Hanoi Opera House]] (Indochina) during the seasons 1895\u20131896 and 1896\u20131897 under the name Alexandra Myrial.{{efn|\"At last, in the autumn of 1895, Alexandra landed a ... 31 She spent the next two years touring French Indochina, now Vietnam, appearing in Hanoi, Haiphong, and elsewhere, while performing lead roles in such operas as La Traviata and Carmen\"<ref>Alexandra David-Neel: Explorer at the Roof of the World \u2013 Page 24 Earle Rice \u2013 2004.</ref>}}\n\nShe interpreted the role of the Violetta in [[La Traviata]] (by [[Verdi]]), then she sang in [[Les Noces de Jeannette]] (by [[Victor Mass\u00e9]]), in [[Faust]] and in [[Mireille]] (by [[Gounod]]), [[Lakm\u00e9]] (by [[L\u00e9o Delibes]]), [[Carmen]] (by [[Bizet]]), and [[Tha\u00efs]] (by [[Massenet]]).

She left to sing at the opera of Athens from November 1899 to January 1900. Then, in July of the same year, she went to the opera of [[Tunis]]. Soon after her arrival in the city, she met a distant cousin, Philippe N\u00e9el, chief engineer of the Tunisian railways and her future husband. During a stay of Jean Haustont in Tunis in the Summer of 1902, she gave up her singing career and assumed artistic direction of the casino of Tunis for a few months, while also continuing her intellectual work.<ref name=\"Chalon\"/>\n\n===1904\u20131911: Marriage===\nOn 4 August 1904,at age 36, she married Philippe Ne\u00e9l de Saint-Sauveur,<ref>{{harvp|D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Marchand|2009}}</ref> whose lover she had been since 15 September 1900. Their life together was sometimes turbulent but characterized by mutual respect. It was, however, interrupted by her departure, alone, for her third trip to India (1911\u20131925) (the second one was carried out for a singing tour) on 9 August 1911. David-N\u00e9el did not want children, she was aware that the charges of motherhood were incompatible with her need of independence and her inclination for education.<ref name=\"Brodeur_181\">{{harvp|Brodeur|2001|p=180}}</ref> She promised to Philippe to get back to the conjugal domicile in nineteen months: but only fourteen years later, in May 1925, did the two spouses meet again, separating after some days, David-N\u00e9el having come back with her exploration partner, the young Lama Aphur Yongden, whom she would make her adopted son in 1929.<ref>(fr) Biographie officielle d'Alexandra David-N\u00e9el (5e partie), on the site alexandra-david-neel.org.</ref><ref name=\"Brodeur_181\"/>\n\nHowever, both spouses started an extensive correspondence after their separation, which only ended with the death of Philippe N\u00e9el in February 1941. From these exchanges, many letters by David-N\u00e9el remain, and some letters written by her husband, many having been burnt or lost on the occasion of David-N\u00e9el's tribulations during the [[Chinese Civil War]], in the middle of the 1940s.\n\nLegend has it that her husband was also her patron, the truth is probably quite different. She had, at her marriage, a personal fortune<ref>(fr) Nico P., Alexandra David-N\u00e9el, exploratrice, f\u00e9ministe, anarchiste, Alternative libertaire, no 187, septembre 2009.</ref> and in 1911, three departments helped her to finance an educational trip. Through the embassies, she sent her husband proxies in order for him to manage her fortune.\n\n===1911\u20131925: The Indo-Tibetan tour===\n\n====Arrival in Sikkim (1912)====\nAlexandra David-N\u00e9el traveled for the second time to India to further her study of [[Buddhism]]. In 1912, she arrived at the royal monastery of [[Sikkim]], where she befriended Maharaj Kumar (crown prince) [[Sidkeong Tulku Namgyal]], the eldest son of the sovereign (Chogyal) of this kingdom (which would become a state of India), and traveled in many Buddhist monasteries to make her knowledge of Buddhism more perfect. In 1914, she met young Aphur Yongden in one of these monasteries, 15 years old, whom she would later adopt as her son. Both decided to retire in a hermitage cavern at more than 4000 meters above sea level in northern Sikkim.\n\nSidkeong, then the spiritual leader of Sikkim, was sent to the meeting with Alexandra David-N\u00e9el by his father, the Maharaja of Sikkim, having been told about her arrival in April 1912 by the British resident at Gangtok. On the occasion of this first encounter, their mutual understanding is immediate: Sidkeong, eager for reformation, was listening to Alexandra David-N\u00e9el's advice, and before returning to his occupations, he left behind the Lama Kazi Dawa Samdup as a guide, interpreter and professor of Tibetan. After that, Sidkeong confided in Alexandra David-N\u00e9el that his father wished for him to renounce the throne in favor of his half-brother.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|p=199}}</ref><ref>[http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Lama_Kazi_Dawa_Samdup&title=Lama%20Kazi%20Dawa%20Samdup Lama Kazi Dawa Samdup]</ref>\n\n====Meeting with the 13th Dalai Lama in Kalimpong (1912)====\nLama [[Kazi Dawa Samdup]] accompanied Alexandra David-N\u00e9el to [[Kalimpong]], where she returned to meet with the [[13th Dalai Lama]] in exile. She received an audience on 15 April 1912, and met [[Ekai Kawaguchi]] in his waiting room, whom she would meet again in Japan. The Dalai Lama welcomed her, accompanied by the inevitable interpreter, and he strongly advised her to learn Tibetan, an advice she followed. She received his blessing, then the Dalai Lama engaged the dialogue, asking her how she had become a Buddhist. David-N\u00e9el amused him by claiming to be the only Buddhist in Paris, and surprised him by telling him that the Gyatcher Rolpa, a sacred Tibetan book, had been translated by [[Phillippe-\u00c9douard Foucaux]], a professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. She asked for many additional explanations that the Dalai Lama tried to provide, promising to answer all her questions in writing.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|pp=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\n====Stay at Lachen (1912\u20131916)====\nIn late May, she went to [[Lachen, Sikkim|Lachen]], where she met ''Lachen Gomchen Rinpoche'', the superior (gomchen) of the town's monastery, with the improvised interpreter M. Owen (E. H. Owen), a reverend who replaced the absent Kazi Dawa Samdup.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|pp=195\u2013201}}</ref> In Lachen, she lived for several years close to one of the greatest gomchens of whom she had the privilege to be taught, and above all, she was very close to the Tibetan border, which she crossed twice against all odds.\n\nIn her anchorite cave, she exercised the methods of Tibetan yogis. She was sometimes in ''tsam'', that is to retreat for several days without seeing anyone, and she learned the technique of [[tummo]], which mobilized her internal energy to produce heat. As a result of this apprenticeship, her master, the Gomchen of Lachen, gave her the religious name of Yshe Tome, \"Lamp of Sagesse\", which proved valuable to her because she was then known by Buddhist authorities everywhere she went in Asia.<ref>{{harvp|Brodeur|2001|pp=184, 187}}</ref>\n\nWhile she was in company of Lachen Gomchen Rinpoche, Alexandra David-N\u00e9el encountered Sidkeong again on an inspection tour in Lachen on 29 May 1912. These three personalities of Buddhism thus reunited reflected and worked together to reform and spread out Buddhism, as the Gomchen would declare.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|p=201}}</ref> For David-N\u00e9el, Sidkeong organized an expedition of one week into the high areas of Sikkim, at 5,000 meters of altitude, which started on 1 July.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|p=202}}</ref>\n\nThere is an epistolary correspondence between Sidkeong and Alexandra David-N\u00e9el. Thus, in a letter by Sidkeong written at Gangtok on 8 October 1912, he thanked her for the meditation method she had sent him. On 9 October, he accompanied her to [[Darjeeling]], where they visited a monastery together, while she prepared to return to [[Calcutta]].<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|pp=205\u2013206}}</ref> In another letter, Sidkeong informed Alexandra David-N\u00e9el that, in March 1913, he was able to enter the [[Freemasonry]] at Calcutta, where he had been admitted as a member, provided with a letter of introduction by the governor of Bengal, a further link between them. He told him of his pleasure of having been allowed to become a member of this society.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|pp=224\u2013225}}</ref>\n\nWhile his father was about to die, Sidkeong called Alexandra David-N\u00e9el for help, and asked her for advice in bringing about the reform of Buddhism that he wished to implement at Sikkim once he would arrive at power.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|p=225}}</ref> Returning to Gangtok via Darjeeling and [[Siliguri]], David-N\u00e9el was received like an official figure, with guard of honor, by Sidkeong on 3 December 1913.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|p=228}}</ref> On 4 January 1914, he gave her, as a gift for the new year, a lamani's (female lama) dress sanctified according to the Buddhist rites.

The campaign of religious reform could begin, Kali Koumar, a monk of the southern Buddhism was called to participate in it, as well as [[S\u012bl\u0101c\u0101ra]] (an Englishman) who was then living in [[Birma]]. Ma Lat (Hteiktin Ma Lat) came from that same country, Alexandra David-N\u00e9el was in correspondence with her, and Sidkeong had to marry her, Alexandra David-N\u00e9el becoming in fact the Maharaja's marriage counselor.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|pp=230\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nWhile she was at the monastery of Phodong, the abbot of which was Sidkeong, Alexandra David-N\u00e9el declared to hear a voice announcing to her that the reforms would fail.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|p=235}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 November 1914, leaving the cavern of Sikkim where she had gone to meet the ''gomchen'', David-N\u00e9el was received at [[Lachen Monastery]] by Sidkeong.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|p=242}}</ref> One month later, she learned about Sidkeong's sudden death, news that affected her and made her think of poisoning.<ref>{{harvp|Chalon|1985|p=243}}</ref>\n\n====First trip to Tibet and meeting with the Panchen Lama (1916)====\nOn 13 July 1916, without asking anyone for permission, Alexandra David-N\u00e9el left for Tibet, accompanied by Yongden and a monk. She planned to visit two great religious centers close to her Sikkim retreat: the monastery of Chorten Nyima and [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]], close to [[Shigatse]], one of the biggest cities of southern Tibet. At the monastery of Tashilhunpo, where she arrived on 16 July, she was allowed to consult the Buddhist scriptures and visit various temples. On the 19th, she met with the [[Panchen Lama]], by whom she received blessings and a charming welcome: he introduced her to his entourage's persons of rank, to his professors, and to his mother (with whom David-N\u00e9el tied bonds of friendship and who suggested to her to reside in a convent). The Panchen Lama bade and proposed her to stay at Shigatse as his guest, what she declined, leaving the town on 26 July, not without having received the honorary titles of a Lama and a doctor in Tibetan Buddhism and having experienced hours of great bliss.{{efn|\"In 1916 she again went into Tibet, this time at the invitation of the Panchen Lama [...]. He gave her access to Tashilhunpo's immense libraries of Buddhists scriptures and made every corner of the various temples accessible to her. She was lavishly entertained by both the Panchen Lama and his mother, with whom she remained a longtime friend. 'The special psychic atmosphere of the place enchanted me,' she later wrote. 'I have seldom enjoyed such blissful hours.'\"<ref name=\"Stockwell_121\">{{harvp|Stockwell|2003|p=121}}</ref>}} She pursued her escapade at Tibet by visiting the printing works of Nartan (snar-thang) before paying a visit to an anchorite which had invited her close to the lake Mo-te-tong. On 15 August, she was welcomed by a Lama at Tranglung.\n\nUpon her return to Sikkim, the colonial British authorities, pushed by missionaries exasperated by the welcome afforded David-N\u00e9el by the Panchen Lama and annoyed by her having ignored their ban of entering Tibet, thrust a notification of expulsion upon her.{{efn|\"Alexandra David-Neel then returned to Sikkim with honorary lama's robes and the equivalent of a Doctor of Philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism. There she found herself slapped with a deportation notice by the British colonial authorities.

There she met the philosopher [[Ekai Kawaguchi]] who had managed to stay for eighteen months in [[Lhasa]] as a Chinese monk in disguise a few years earlier. David-N\u00e9el and Yongden subsequently left for [[Korea]] and then [[Beijing]], [[China]]. From there, they chose to cross China from east to west, accompanied by a colourful Tibetan Lama. Their journey took several years through the Gobi, Mongolia, before a break of three years (1918\u20131921) at [[Kumbum Monastery]] in Tibet, where David-N\u00e9el, helped by Yongden, translated the famous [[Prajnaparamita]].<ref name=\"Brodeur_180\"/>\n\n====Incognito stay in Lhasa (1924)====\n [[File:Alexandria David-NeelinLhasa.gif|thumb|upright|In Lhasa in 1924.]]\nDisguised as a beggar and a monk, respectively, and carrying a backpack as discreet as possible, Alexandra David-N\u00e9el and Yongden then left for the Forbidden City. In order not to betray her status as a foreigner, David-N\u00e9el did not dare to take a camera and survey equipment, she hid, however, under her rags a compass, a pistol, and a purse with money for a possible ransom.

In Brisbane, Davidson shared a house with biologists and studied zoology. Later, she went to Sydney and lived a bohemian life as a member of [[Sydney Push|the Push]].\n\nIn 1975, Davidson moved to [[Alice Springs]] in an effort to work with camels for a desert trek she was planning. For two years she trained camels and learned how to survive in the harsh desert.  She was peripherally involved in the Aboriginal Land Rights movement.\n\nFor some years in the 1980s she was in a relationship with [[Salman Rushdie]], to whom she was introduced by their mutual friend [[Bruce Chatwin]].<ref>Bruce Chatwin, letter to Ninette Dutton, 1 November 1984, in ''Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin'', ed.

She was the first woman to have crossed the [[Sahara]] desert by car. She was perhaps the first female rally driver in Sweden (1925), and the third Swedish female aviator (1923).\n\n==Biography==\nEva Dickson was the daughter of the wealthy Albert Lindstr\u00f6m, who managed stud farms for [[horse breeding]], and his wife Maria. In 1925 she married the rally driver Olof Dickson, great-grandson of [[James Dickson (merchant)|James Dickson]], but they divorced in 1932 as he didn't agree to her travels. Her travels attracted great attention, and she published several travel guides and descriptions of her experiences. She financed her travels by making bets with various wealthy society people.\n\nIn 1932 she met the former spouse of [[Karen Blixen]], Baron [[Bror von Blixen-Finecke]], in [[Kenya]], and they became lovers. After her meeting with Blixen in 1932, she took a bet and drove by car from [[Nairobi]] to [[Stockholm]] in 1932, thus becoming the first woman to have crossed the Sahara by car.<ref name=PopHist>[http://www.popularhistoria.se/artiklar/aventyraren-eva-dickson/ Popul\u00e4r Historia, 23 januari, 2009: ''\u00c4ventyraren Eva Dickson''] (in Swedish) Linked 2014-04-06</ref>\n\nIn 1934 she was back in Kenya with Bror Blixen, where she participated in various scientific expeditions. The following year they both travelled to [[Ethiopia]], where she covered the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] as a [[war correspondent]] for a Swedish newspaper. They left Ethiopia on [[mule]]s, on a 2,000 kilometre trip back to Kenya.<ref name= PopHist/>\n\nIn 1936, they married in [[New York]] and spent their honeymoon sailing around [[Cuba]] and the [[Bahamas]] with friends [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Martha Gellhorn]].<ref name= PopHist/>\n\nOn 3 June 1937, she started a car trip from [[Stockholm]] to [[Beijing]] via the [[Silk Road]]. To become the first person to drive the Silk Road had long been her big dream, and something she wanted to do before settling down with Bror in Kenya.<ref name= PopHist/> Driving without any companions, the trip took her through [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Turkey]], [[Syria]] and [[Iran]]. After having reached [[Afghanistan]], she was advised to detour via [[India]], as her intended route was regarded too dangerous for a lone woman. When she reached [[Calcutta]], she was taken ill and treated with a cure of arsenic in a hospital, which worsened her condition.<ref name= PopHist/>\n\nWhile in Calcutta she realised that she was running out of money. She also learned the news of the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]], so she realised that she had to give up her plan to reach Beijing. Although weak after her hospital spell, she decided to drive back to Europe.<ref name= PopHist/> When she reached [[Baghdad]] in [[Iraq]] in March 1938, her trip had been going on for nine months. After a dinner one evening outside Baghdad at some friends' house, she was driving back to her hotel, but lost control over the car in a steep curve and crashed. She died immediately. Her husband, Bror von Blixen, was immediately telegraphed about her death, but he was out on a safari and didn't get the telegram until he came back to Nairobi on 28 July 1938.

She was the wife of [[Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy]]. Together with her husband, she is known for her excavations at [[Susa]].\n\n==Career==\nJane Dieulafoy was born Jeanne Henriette Magre to a wealthy family in [[Toulouse, France]]. She studied at the [[convent|Couvent]] de l\u2019Assomption d\u2019Auteuil in a suburb of Paris from 1862 to 1870. She married Marcel Dieulafoy in May 1870, at the age of 19. That same year, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began. Marcel volunteered, and was sent to the front. Jane accompanied him, [[cross-dressing during wartime|wearing a soldier's uniform]]{{sfn |Adams|2010|pp =49}} and fighting by his side.{{sfn |MME. JANE DIEULAFOY DEAD...}}\n\nWith the end of the war, Marcel was employed by the Midi railways, but during the next ten years the Dieulafoys would travel in [[Egypt]] and [[Morocco]] for archaeological and exploration work. Jane did not keep a record of these journeys. Marcel became increasingly interested in the relationship between Oriental and Western architecture, and in 1879 decided to devote himself to archaeology.{{sfn|Cohen|Joukowsky|2006|pp=39}}\n[[File:Citadel of Varamin by Jane Dieulafoy.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Citadel of [[Varamin]] by Jane Dieulafoy]]\n[[File:Bazar Shiraz as seen by Jane Dieulafoy, 1881.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An illustration of a Persian bazaar in Shiraz|[[Vakil Bazaar]] of [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], as seen by Jane Dieulafoy in 1881.]]\nThe Dieulafoys first visited Persia in 1881, and would return twice after that. The first journey to Persia was by freighter from [[Marseilles]] to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], by a Russian boat to [[Poti]] on the east coast of the [[Black Sea]], and then across the [[Caucasus]] and via Azerbaijan to [[Tabriz]].{{sfn|Cohen|Joukowsky|2006|pp=41}} From there they travelled widely through Persia, to Tehran, Esfahan and Shiraz.{{sfn|Cohen|Joukowsky|2006|pp=39}} Jane Dieulafoy documented the pair's explorations in photographs, illustrations, and writing. She took daily notes during her travels, which were later published in two volumes.{{sfn|Calmard|1995}}\n\nAt Susa, the couple found numerous artifacts and friezes, several of which were shipped back to France. One such find is the famous Lion Frieze on display at the [[Louvre]].{{sfn|Adams|2010|pp=42}} Two rooms in the museum contain artefacts brought back by the Dieulafoy missions. For her contributions, the French government conferred upon her the title of Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1886.{{sfn|Calmard|1995}}\n\nAfter their journeys in Persia, Dieulafoy and her husband spent time traveling in [[Spain]] and Morocco between 1888 and 1914. She also wrote two novels: Her first was ''Parysatis'', in 1890, set in ancient Susa. It  was later adapted into an opera by [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]. Her second, ''D\u00e9ch\u00e9ance'', was published in 1897.{{sfn|Calmard|1995}} Marcel volunteered to go to [[Rabat, Morocco]] during [[the First World War]], and Jane accompanied him. While in Morocco, her health began to decline. She contracted [[amoebic dysentery]]{{sfn|Adams|2010|pp=61}} and was forced to return to France where she died in [[Pompertuzat]] in 1916. The childless couple left their home at 12, rue Chardin in Paris to the French Red Cross who continue to operate an office from the building to this day. {{sfn|Gran-Aymeric|1991|pp=311}}\n\n==Cross-dressing==\n\n[[File:Jane et Marcel Dieulafoy.jpg|thumb|alt=Jane and Marcel Dieulafoy|Jane (left, in men's clothing) with her husband.]]\nDuring her travels abroad, Jane Dieulafoy preferred to [[cross-dressing|dress in men's clothing]] and wear her hair short, because it was otherwise difficult for a woman to travel freely in a Muslim country. She had also dressed as a man when she fought alongside Marcel Dieulafoy during the Franc-Prussian war and she kept dressing in men's clothing when she came back in France. This was against the law in France at the time, but when she returned from the Middle East she received special \"permission de travestissement\" from the prefect of police.{{sfn|MME. JANE DIEULAFOY DEAD...}} It is difficult to determine Dieulafoy's motives for choosing to wear men's clothing. {{sfn|Irvine|1999|pp=13-23}} She wrote, \"I only do this to save time. I buy ready-made suits and I can use the time saved this way to do more work\"{{sfn|Adams|2010|pp=56}} but, given that she includes many characters who cross-dress in her fiction (see her novels Volontaire and Fr\u00e8re P\u00e9lage, for example) she was clearly fascinated with the subject of cross-dressing and her motives appear to be more complex than mere convenience.\n\nDieulafoy considered herself an equal to her husband, but was also fiercely loyal to him. She was opposed to the idea of divorce, believing it degraded women.{{sfn|Adams|2010|pp=57}} During the [[First World War]], she petitioned for allowing women a greater role in the military.{{sfn|Calmard|1995}} She was a member of the jury of the [[prix Femina]] literary prize from its creation in 1904 until her death.{{sfn|Irvine|2008|pp=10-11}}\n\n==Bibliography==\nMajor published works:{{sfn|Calmard|1995}}\n*{{cite book |title=La Perse, la Chald\u00e9e et la Susiane 1881\u20131882 |location=Paris |year=1887}}\n*{{cite book |title=L\u2019Orient sous le voile.

In 1975, she went on holiday to Africa with a girlfriend and two men. The men stole their jeep, leaving the women stranded until they found two wild horses to ride. Her friend returned home, but Dodwell stayed in Africa for three years, travelling by horse, elephant and [[camel]].  During this time she spent seven weeks going down the [[Congo River]] in a dug-out [[canoe]]. After travelling twenty thousand miles around Africa, between 1975 and 1978, Dodwell returned to England and wrote a book about her African experiences, ''Travels with Fortune''. However, she found home life boring and went on to other explorations. Her second major expedition was to [[Papua New Guinea]], travelling by horse and canoe, in 1980 to 1981, and her later travels have included [[Turkey]], China, [[Madagascar]] and [[Siberia]], and a seven thousand mile flight by [[Ultralight aviation|microlight]] across West Africa.<ref name=Who/><ref name=Kay/><ref name=trust>[http://www.dodwell-trust.org/christina.html CHRISTINA DODWELL, EXPLORER, AUTHOR, BROADCASTER AND FOUNDER OF THE DODWELL TRUST] at dodwell-trust.org</ref> She was arrested in [[Gonbad, Afghanistan|Gonbad]] and [[Kurdistan]].<ref name=Kay/>\n\nIn [[Kraimbit]], [[New Guinea]], Dodwell was initiated into manhood by the crocodile people{{Clarify|date=October 2009}} of the [[New Guinea]] lowlands.

Mark Patterson co-led the expedition with Earle. Their aquanaut team also included underwater filmmaker D.J. Roller and oceanographer M.

She was educated in Switzerland by her father, who was a tutor, and published short stories under a male pseudonym as a teenager. She took an interest in North Africa and wrote about the area with \"remarkable insight and knowledge\" despite having only heard about it via correspondence. Upon invitation Eberhardt relocated to Algeria in May 1897, where she dressed as a man and converted to [[Islam]], eventually adopting the name '''Si Mahmoud Saadi'''.  Eberhardt's unorthodox behaviour made her a social pariah from both the European settlers in Algeria and the French administration.\n\nEberhardt was accepted into the [[Qadiriyya]], which convinced the French administration that she was either a spy or an agitator. She survived an assassination attempt shortly thereafter. In 1901 she was ordered to leave Algeria by the French administration though was allowed to return the following year after she married her long-time partner Slimane Ehnni, an Algerian soldier. After returning to Algeria she found employment at a newspaper and also worked for General [[Hubert Lyautey]]. In 1904 she was killed in a [[flash flood]] in [[A\u00efn Sefra]] at the age of 27. The majority of her writings, which found critical acclaim, were not published until after her death. [[Anti-imperialism|Anti-colonialism]] was a regular theme of her writings.\n\n==Early life and family background==\nEberhardt was born in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, to Alexandre Trophimowsky, an [[anarchism|anarchist]], tutor and former Orthodox priest<ref name=\"ren\">{{cite web | url=http://www.kritische-ausgabe.de/hefte/reich/Rentsch_Wolff_Eberhardt.pdf | title=Stillgestellter Orient \u2013 100th anniversary of death of Isabelle Eberhardt | publisher=Kritische Ausgabe | date=February 2004 | accessdate=20 June 2012 | author=Rentsch, Steffi | language=German}}</ref> turned atheist,<ref name=\"Blanch\"/> and Nathalie Moerder (n\u00e9e Eberhardt), who was the [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] daughter of a middle-class [[Lutheran]] German and a Russian Jew.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|pp=141}}{{sfn|Abdel-Jaouad|1993|page=95}} Nathalie had married a widower, General Pavel de Moerder, who was forty years older than she was,{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} and the general had hired Trophimowsky to tutor his and Nathalie's two children, Nicolas and Vladimir.\n\nEventually, Nathalie took their children and left her husband for Trophimowsky, who had a wife and family that he likewise deserted.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|pp=142}} After eventually settling in Geneva{{sfn|Bodley|1968|pp=142}} in either late 1871 or early 1872 Nathalie gave birth to a son, Augustin; de Moerder recognised the son as his own.

The story was about a medical student's physical attraction to a woman's corpse. The following year she wrote the short story \"Per fas et nefas\", which focused on the theme of male homosexuality.{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}}\n\n==Relocation to North Africa==\n[[File:IsEberhardt.jpg|thumb|right|Eberhardt in Arab dress, around the year 1900|alt=Eberhardt as a young adult wearing traditional arabic clothing]]\nIn November 1895 Eberhardt received a letter telling her that Augustin had joined the [[French Foreign Legion]] and was assigned to Algeria. Eberhardt wrote to him, asking him to keep a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa and send it to her.{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} She also kept in regular correspondence with Eug\u00e8ne Letord, a French officer stationed in the Sahara who had taken out a newspaper advertisement seeking a [[pen pal]].{{sfn|Bodley|1968|pp=143}}{{sfn|Abdel-Jaouad|1993|page=96}} In 1895 Eberhardt published \"Vision du Moghreb [sic]\" ({{lang-en|Vision of the [[Greater Maghreb|Maghreb]]}}),{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} under her pseudonym Podolinsky in ''Nouvelle Revue Moderne''.{{sfn|Abdel-Jaouad|1993|page=96}} The story depicted religious life in North Africa.{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} For someone who had only heard about North Africa by correspondence, Eberhardt displayed \"remarkable insight and knowledge\" of the area,{{sfn|Abdel-Jaouad|1993|page=96}} and her writings had a strong [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] theme. Louis David, an Algerian-French photographer who had been touring Switzerland and was intrigued by her writings, met with Eberhardt and invited her to visit him in [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]], Algeria.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|pp=144}} She travelled there with her mother in May 1897.{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}}{{sfn|Abdel-Jaouad|1993|page=96}} The two initially lived with the Davids, who disapproved of Eberhardt and her mother spending too much time with Arabic people.

By chance in Paris, however, she met the widow of [[Marquis de Mores]]. It was reported that de Mor\u00e8s had been murdered by [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] tribesmen in the Sahara, though no-one had been arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt was familiar with the area in which de Mor\u00e8s had been murdered, she offered to pay for Eberhardt to go and make private investigations into his murder. Eberhardt, who was destitute by this time and longing to get back to the Sahara, enthusiastically accepted the offer. She crossed into Algiers on July 21, 1900 and settled in [[El Oued]]. According to [[R. V. C. Bodley]], an expert on the Sahara, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate the death of de Mor\u00e8s, though rather than deliberate dishonesty Bodley considered this to be due to a combination of Eberhardt's [[Fatalism|fatalist]] attitude and the unwillingness of the French to co-operate in any investigation of de Mor\u00e8s.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=149}}\n\nEberhardt set about making friends with in the area, and met an Algerian soldier named Slimane Ehnni. The two fell in love and eventually lived openly together. This gesture, however, completely ostracised Eberhardt from the French authorities, who were already outraged by her lifestyle.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=150}} On her travels she made contact with a [[Sufism|Sufi]] order, the [[Qadiriyya]]. The order was led by Hussein ben Brahim, who was so impressed with Eberhardt's knowledge of and passion for Islam he initiated her into his [[Zawiya (institution)|zawiya]] without the usual formal examinations.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=151}} This, however, convinced the French authorities that she was either a spy or an agitator, and they placed her on a widely circulated [[Blacklisting|blacklist]]. The French transferred Ehnni to the [[spahi]] regiment at [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]], possibly to punish Eberhardt, whom they could not harm personally.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=152}} As she was too poor to travel with Ehnni to Batna, Eberhardt attended a Qadiriyya meeting at the beginning of 1901 in Behima, where she hoped to ask a [[marabout]] for financial assistance. Here she was attacked by a man with a [[sabre]]. Eberhardt managed to dodge most of the man's attacks until others at the meeting overpowered and disarmed him.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=153}} Eberhardt suspected that the French authorities had hired him to assassinate her.{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} Her arm and shoulder were badly injured, and she was transported to the military hospital at El Oued the following day. Once she had recovered, she journeyed to join Ehnni, having gathered funds from members of the Qadiriyya, who regarded Eberhardt's survival of the attack as a miracle.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=153}}\n\n[[File:Slimane Ehnni.png|thumb|left|Slimane Ehnni, Eberhardt's husband|alt=A portrait photograph Ehnni, a dark-skinned man wearing a turban]]\n\nAfter being reunited with Ehnni, the French authorities ordered Eberhardt to leave North Africa, without giving any reason. As she was an immigrant, she had no choice but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors' to marry Eberhardt in order to allow her to stay, though his request was denied. She travelled to France in May 1901, though was summoned to [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] in the middle of June in order to give evidence at the trial of Abdallah ben si Mohammed, the man who had attacked her. Abdallah stated that God had ordered him to destroy Eberhardt, who he had never seen or heard of before the attack.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=154}} Eberhardt said she held no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and stated she hoped he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment; the prosecutor had called for the death penalty. Once the trial had finished, Eberhardt was once again ordered to leave the country, and she returned to France. She lived with her brother Augustin and his wife, and, while disguised as a man, joined her brother in working as a [[Stevedore|dock labourer]]. During this time she began to write the novel ''Trimardeur''.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=155}}\n\nEberhardt was encouraged to write by [[Eug\u00e8ne Brieux]], who was opposed to the way the French were ruling in North Africa and was in favour of Arab emancipation. He sent her several hundred [[French franc|francs]] as an advanced royalty and tried to publish her stories, though was unable to find anyone willing to publish pro-Arab writings. Eberhardt, however, was not discouraged and continued writing. Her morale was lifted when Ehnni was transferred to a [[spahi]] regiment near [[Marseille]], where he was to complete his final months of service.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=156}} In France, Ehnni did not require permission from his military superiors to marry.{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} The couple were married<ref name=\"enni\">{{cite web | url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D42698.php | title=Eberhardt, Isabelle | publisher=Swiss Historical Lexikon | work=Biography | date=7 November 2005 | accessdate=20 June 2012 | author=Vuilleumie, Marc | language=German}}</ref> on 17 October 1901.

Throughout 1902 and 1903 she published several short stories in the newspaper; ''Trimardeur'' began to appear as a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] in the newspaper in August 1903. Barrucand dispatched Eberhardt to report on the aftermath of the [[Battle of El-Moungar]], which occurred on 2 September 1903. She stayed with soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, and at their headquarters met [[Hubert Lyautey]], the French officer placed in charge of [[Oran]]. The two became friends, and due to Eberhardt's knowledge of Arabic and Islam, she became a liaison between Lyautey and the local Arabic people.{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} While specific details are unclear, it is generally accepted that Eberhardt also engaged in some form of espionage for Lyautey.{{sfn|Belenky|2011|page=103}} Such behaviour has caused discussion about Eberhardt's complicity with colonialism by modern historians.{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} Weakened by fever, Eberhardt headed for [[A\u00efn Sefra]], and requested Ehnni, whom she had not seen for several months, to join her.{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} Reunited on 20 October 1904, the two rented a small mud house.

Barrucand collected these, many of which were water-logged and damaged. After reconstituting the documents, and substituting his own words where the originals were too damaged to decipher,{{sfn|Chouiten|2012|pp=59\u201366}} Barrucand began to publish her works. The first of the posthumous publications, ''Dans l'Ombre Chaude de l'Islam'' (\"In the Warm Shadow of Islam\") was met with critical acclaim when it was released in 1906. A street was subsequently named after Eberhardt in [[B\u00e9char]], and another in Algiers.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=165}} Eberhardt was posthumously regarded to be an advocate of [[decolonisation]], and according to Hedi Abdel-Jaouad wiriting in ''[[Yale French Studies]]'', her work may have inaugurated the decolonisation of North Africa.{{sfn|Abdel-Jaouad|1993|page=102}}\n\nIn 1954, the critic and novelist [[Cecily Mackworth]] published \"The Destiny of Isabelle Eberhardt\", an evaluation of her work Mackworth undertook after following routes taken by Eberhardt in Algeria and the Sahara.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bowker|first1=Gordon|title=Cecily Mackworth|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cecily-mackworth-410094.html|work=The Independent|date=July 31, 2006}}</ref> Mackworth maintained that \"The Oblivion Seekers\" was \"[o]ne of the strangest human documents that a woman has given to the world.\"\n\nIn 1976 [[William Bayer]] published ''Visions Of Isabelle'', a fictionalized account of the life of Eberhardt.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bayer |first=William |authorlink=William Bayer |year=1976 |title=Visions of Isabelle |publisher=Delacorte Press |isbn=978-0-440-09315-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]] premiered a play about Eberhardt entitled ''New Anatomies''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=Verna A. |date=2007 |title=Reinventing Isabelle Eberhardt: Rereading Timberlake Wertenbaker's New Anatomies |url=http://www.connotations.de/pdf/articles/foster01701.pdf |journal=Connotations: A Journal for Critical Debate |publisher= |volume=17 |issue= |pages=109\u2013128 |doi= |access-date=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988 [[Leslie Thornton]] directed a biography on Eberhardt entitled ''There Was An Unseen Cloud Moving''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Blaetz |first=Robin |date=25 September 2007 |title=Women's Experimental Cinema: Critical Frameworks |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=e8Wj-XgOMdAC&pg=PA252 |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |ASIN=B0140D5CEG |page=252}}</ref>\n\nEberhardt was portrayed by [[Mathilda May]] in the 1991 film ''[[Isabelle Eberhardt (film)|Isabelle Eberhardt]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/518333/Isabelle-Eberhardt/ |title=Isabelle Eberhardt (1991) |work=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 [[John Berger]] and [[Nella Bielski]] published a cinematic \"novel in shots\" based on Eberhardt's life, ''Isabelle''.\n\nOn 24 February 2012, an opera composed by [[Missy Mazzoli]], ''Song from the Uproar: The Lives and Deaths of Isabelle Eberhardt'', premiered in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2012-02-24/song-uproar-opera-isabelle-eberhardt |title='Song from the Uproar': An Opera on Isabelle Eberhardt |last=Mullins |first=Lisa |date=24 February 2012 |work=[[Public Radio International]] |access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n{{library resources box|by=yes|onlinebooksby=yes|viaf=73871242}}\n{{div col|cols=2}}\n*''Dans l'ombre chaude de l'Islam'', by Eberhardt and Victor Barrucand (Paris: Fasquelle, 1906)\n*''Notes de route: Maroc-Alg\u00e9rie-Tunisie'', edited by Victor Barrucand (Paris: Fasquelle, 1908)\n*''Au Pays des sables'' (B\u00f4ne, Algeria: Em.

This convent was attached to the parish of San Sebastian<nowiki>'s el antiguo. Called this after the tradition of calling the place named that the first town. At that time, it was normal for young girls to enter education according to the criteria of Catholicism promoting the learning of ''female tasks''</nowiki> and subsequently to be betrothed \"as God intended\". Because of her explosive character and given the difficulty the nuns had to control her, she was transferred to the Monastery of San Bartolome de San Sebastian until she was 15, where the rules were much stricter. She realized that she had no religious vocation, for which she felt imprisoned and refused to profess her vows. Catalina de Erauso was detained in her cell because of the constant fights she had with a widow novice named Mrs Catalina de Alirli. For this reason, on the night of March 18, 1600, the eve of San Jose, she found the keys of the convent hanging in a corner and took advantage of it to escape. She made menswear with the materials she found, cut her hair and hid her habit.\n\n== Fugitive status in Spain ==\nFrom this moment, she began the life of a fugitive. Later, she narrated this in her autobiography, which gave her great fame. She ate what she found on the way walking through different villages, this is how she reached Vitoria, a city 20 miles from San Sebastian. There she met a doctor and professor Mr. Francisco de Cerralta, who gave her clothes and took her in without recognising her. He was married to her mother's cousin. She stayed with him for 3 months, during which she learnt some Latin . After having forced her to continue studying and attempted sexual abuse,Catalina took money from the doctor and met a mule driver and went to Valladolid with him. In which the court of King Philip III resided, widely influenced by the [[Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval, 1st Duke of Lerma|Duke of Lerma]], \"Valido del Rey\". Catalina, disguised as a man, by the name of Francisco de Loyola, served in the court as a page of the secretary of King Juan de Idiaquez for seven months. She had to flee from [[Valladolid]] when she met her father, who came looking for his good friend Mr. Juan de Idi\u00e1quez. Her father asked for information to find her, describing her physical appearance and the way she escaped from the convent. Surprisingly, her father did not recognise her despite having spoken with her. however, she decided to run away again. This time, she took the longest route towards Bilbao. When she arrived, she was not as lucky as before, she did not find a place to sleep nor a patron. In addition, she had a fight with some young men who tried to assault her, so she took a stone and wounded one of them.  Thus, she was arrested and stayed in prison for a month.  Once released from prison she went to Estella de Navarra and managed to settle herself as a page of an important lord of the town called Alonso de Arellano. Catalina was his servant for two years, always well treated and well dressed. Between 1602 and 1603, After her years of service to Arellano, she returned to San Sebasti\u00e1n, her hometown, where she lived as a man, taking care of her relatives, whom she saw frequently. She also attended mass in her old convent with her former colleagues.  It's said that she has also served her aunt without ever being recognized. After some time, she came to Puerto de Pasajes, where she met Captain Miguel de Berr\u00f3iz, who took her to Seville. They were there for only two days. She later returned to Sanlucar de Barrameda, where she found a job as a cabin boy on a ship. Captain Estaban Egui\u00f1o, who was a cousin of her mother, owned the galleon.

From there they left for Cartagena and Nombre de Dios, where they stayed for nine days. Several sailors died there because of the weather. They boarded the silver and once ready to return to Spain, Catalina shot and killed her uncle and stole 500 pesos. She told to the sailors that her uncle had sent her on an errand. An hour later, the ship returned to Spain without her. From there she went with an usher to Panama, where she spent three months. In Panama she started working with Juan de Urquiza, merchant of Trujillo with whom she went to the port of Paita (now Peru ), where the trader had a large shipment. In the port of Manta (now Ecuador ), a strong wind destroyed the ship and she had to swim to save herself and her master. The rest of the crew perished. After a brief time in Paita, she went to Zana. A place full of cattle, grains, fruits and tobacco from Peru . There, her master happily accommodated her. He gave her a home, clothing and a large amount of money, as well as three black slaves. In Sa\u00f1a she had a fight with a young man who threatened her in a comedy theater. She ended up cutting off the face of the boy who challenged her. She was taken to jail again and through efforts of her master Juan de Urquiza, and the bishop of that place, she was released on the condition that she married Dona Beatriz de Cardenas, lady of her master and aunt of the man who had his face cut. Not wanting to be discovered, she refused to marry. Then she went to the city of Trujillo, where her master opened a store. However, the man who was wounded in the face, came to challenge her again accompanied by two friends. She went to the fight with another person, and in the fight the man's friend was killed. She was again imprisoned, and after her master saved her again, he gave her money and a letter of recommendation and sent her to Lima, which was the capital of the then Viceroyalty of Peru. She gave the letter of recommendation to Diego de Solarte, a very rich merchant and greater consul of Lima, and after a few days she was given his shop. She was responsible for the business for nine months, but was fired when discovered fondling a woman, the sister of her masters wife. After being dismissed, she found a company recruiting, whose aim was the conquest of [[Chile]] and, beset by the need to find a new job, she enlisted under the command of Captain Gonzalo Rodriguez. She was accompanied by 1600 men from [[Lima]] to the city of Concepci\u00f3n.\n\n== Military exploits ==\nAfter marching with her company to [[Chile]] in 1619, her army swept through the lands and property of the Mapuches, showing her aggressive side as conqueror, massacring many Indians. In Chile she was welcomed by the secretary of the governor, who was her brother, Don Miguel de Erauso, but did not recognize her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/39681/27534|title=Catalina de Erauso.

There she fought in the service of the crown in the War of Arauco against the Mapuches in today's Chile, earning a reputation for being brave and skillful with weapons and without revealing that she was a woman.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn the battle of Valdivia she received the rank of second lieutenant. In the next battle of Puren her captain died and she took command, winning the battle. However, due to the many complaints that existed against her for her cruelty against the Indians, she was not promoted to the next military rank. This frustration led to a period devoted to vandalizing, killing as many people as she crossed the road, causing extensive damage and burning entire crops. In Conception she assassinated the chief auditor of the city, for which she was locked in a church for six months. After being released, she killed her brother Don Miguel de Erausco in another duel and was again imprisoned eight months. She later fled to Argentina across the Andes, through a difficult transition path. She was saved at the brink of death by a villager and taken to Tucum\u00e1n, where she promised marriage to two young women, the daughter of an Indian widow (which had hosted Catalina on his farm during her convalescence) and the niece of a canon. She ended up fleeing from there without marrying any of them, but kept the money and clothing from Holland, given by the niece of the canon as a sign of love. Then she went to Potos\u00ed, where she became the assistant to a sergeant, and returned again to fight against the Indians, participating in mass killings in Chuncos. In la Plata (Chuquisaca) she was accused of a crime she did not commit, she was tortured and finally set free again (without revealing her identity). Once out of prison, she devoted herself to smuggle wheat and cattle on the orders of Juan Lopez de Arquijo. A new lawsuit forced her to take refuge in a church. In Piscobamba, by quarreling, she killed another individual. This time she was sentenced to death, but was saved at the last minute by the deposition of another prisoner sentenced to death. Then she remained in a holy asylum for five months in a church due to a duel with a jealous husband. When she moved to La Paz, she was sentenced again to death for another offense. To escape, she pretended to confess and, after seizing a consecrated host fled to Cuzco<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/39681/27537|title=Catalina de Erauso en Bolivia|last=|first=|date=|website=Euskomedia|publisher=|access-date=11 July 2013|language=es}}</ref> and returned to Peru. On this fact, the traditionalist Peruvian Ricardo Palma wrote the tradition entitled \"To church called me!\"\n\n== Return to Spain and audience with Pope Urban VIII ==\nIn 1623 she was arrested in Huamanga, Peru, because of a dispute. To prevent her execution she begged for mercy to Bishop Agustin de Carvajal, and confessed that she was actually a woman who had been in a convent. Following a review by a group of matrons, they determined it was true that she was a woman and a virgin, the bishop protected her and she was sent to Spain.\n\nIn 1625-1626, she petitioned the Spanish Crown for financial reward for her services as a soldier in the New World. She did this in her ''relaci\u00f3n de m\u00e9ritos y servicios'' (Account of Merits and Services). In addition to seeking reward for her time at war, she also sought compensation for money she lost while spent traveling to Rome. This document includes accounts from \"witnesses\" or others who knew Erauso. However, many of the accounts are contradictory in nature and some do not know what to make of Erauso's predicament. The reason that their accounts are different is for a few reasons. Firstly, they all knew Erauso by different names and different accomplishments. They may have known Alonso D\u00edaz de Guzm\u00e1n, the name Erauso used while dressing as a man, but they did not know Catalina.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Goldmark|first=Matthew|date=2015-04-03|title=Reading Habits: Catalina de Erauso and the Subjects of Early Modern Spanish Gender and Sexuality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10609164.2015.1040278|journal=Colonial Latin American Review|volume=24|issue=2|pages=215\u2013235|doi=10.1080/10609164.2015.1040278|issn=1060-9164}}</ref>\n\nScholars are conflicted as to whether or not this visit between Erauso and Pope Urban VIII actually occurred, but her Account of Merits and Services can be found in the [[Archivo General de Indias and the Real Academia de la Historia de Madrid]] and it was filed between 1625 and 1626, which would match up with the accounts of her being in Rome at that time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Return to America and death ==\nIn 1630 she settled in the [[New Spain]], probably in the city of Orizaba in the state of Veracruz, where she established a businessas a mule skinner between Mexico City and Veracruz . Locals state that she died carrying a load on a boat, although some argue that her death occurred at the top of Orizaba, alone among their asses cargo. The most plausible is that she died in the village of Cotaxtla . According to the historian Joaquin Arroniz, her remains rest in the Church of the Royal Hospital of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception of the Juaninos Brothers, which today is popularly known as the Church of San Juan de Dios city of Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico . Although there is no solid evidence to support it, some postulate that Bishop Juan de Palafox tried to move her remains to the city of Puebla, home to the bishopric, but failed. Instead, according to other historians, the remains of Catalina de Erauso rest in the same place where it is believed she died, in the village of Cotaxtla.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmundodeorizaba.com/opinion/columnas/1570656-01|title=Historia, cultura y turismo en Orizaba|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Agust\u00edn Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez|access-date=12 July 2014}}</ref> <sup>[</sup>However, there is no documentation that can demonstrate the exact date and place of death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/archivo/20140519/abci-monja-alferez-catalina-erauso-201405161602.html|title=Catalina de Erauso, la monja espa\u00f1ola que se disfraz\u00f3 de hombre y combati\u00f3 como soldado en Am\u00e9rica|last=VILLATORO|first=MANUEL P.|date=|website=ABC.es|publisher=|access-date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Autobiography and controversy over its authorship ==\nCatalina wrote or dictated a book of her memoirs, that were first published in [[Paris]] in 1829 at the request of Joaquin Maria Ferrer, a second time in Barcelona in 1838 and for the third time (1894) in Paris, with illustrations by Spanish artist Daniel Vierge . Then they were translated into several languages and versions of the theme, as idealized by Thomas De Quincey, entitled ''The Ensign Nun'' in English.\n\nIn addition to these editions, a series of reprints of her autobiography after 1894, and about her return to Spain, a comedy was released by [[Juan P\u00e9rez de Montalb\u00e1n]], ''Comedia famosa de la Monja Alferez'' (1625).

While Erauso never mentions specifically in her [[memoir]] being attracted to a man, there are numerous instances of relationships with other women. There was an encounter with the sister-in-law of a [[Lima]] merchant, a quarrel with Erauso's brother over his mistress and other occasions of Erauso being betrothed to women in the [[New World]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Those betrothals, however, usually ended after Erauso exploited the situation and rode off with gifts and dowry money.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/literature/erauso_c_L.pdf|title=Erauso, Catalina de (ca 1592- ca1650)|last=Rapp|first=Linda|date=|website=www.glbtq.com|publisher=|access-date=17 February 2016}}</ref> Catalina also mentions a [[Lesbian feminism|lesbian]] encounter when a hostess surprises her by \"touching between her legs,\" and also acknowledges having taken advantage twice of her disguise as a man to get gifts from her future fianc\u00e9e who didn't know her true identity.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://mith.umd.edu/eada/html/display.php?docs=erauso_autobiography.xml&action=show|title=The Autobiography of do\u00f1a Catalina de Erauso, by Catalina de Erauso 1592-1650|last=|first=|date=|website=mith.umd.edu|publisher=|access-date=17 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars, such as Sherry Velasco, have also written on the subject of [[gender]] and [[sexual identity]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCEweX1U3MEC|title=The Lieutenant Nun: Transgenderism, Lesbian Desire, and Catalina de Erauso|last=Velasco|first=Sherry|date=2000-01-01|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292787469|language=en}}</ref> In Velasco's case, she argues for Erauso's [[lesbianism]] and [[Transgender people and religion|transgenderism]]. She argues that, throughout the years since the first printings of Erauso's memoirs, there have been a lot of different retellings and exaggerations. In those retellings of Erauso's story, she says that there has been an effort to \"de-lesbianize\" Erauso through the invention of different heterosexual relationships as well as downplaying her relationships and behavior with other women.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> This happened mostly in versions of the story told and published in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Velasco argues, there was actually a \"re-lesbianization\" of Erauso. This happened originally in heterosexual, femme-fatale in the 1940s to appeal to younger women as glamorous. Then, later in the 1980s, she appeared as a \"melancholy lesbian whose lover dies and a voyeuristic lesbian whose narrative ends with the optimistic image of the [[protagonist]] accompanied by the object of her sexual desire.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOther scholars, such as Matthew Goldmark, also argue for Erauso's sexual orientation and identity. However, he takes the approach of examining her Accounts of Merits and Services document. In particular, Goldmark examines the \"''h\u00e1bitos\"'' or \"habits\" section of the document. This section gives accounts from witnesses or other people that knew Erauso and could speak to her demeanor in her petition of the King and the Pope. This section also was an intersection of not only gender, but also class and profession. The accounts in Erauso's document support and show how Erauso and others navigated ideas of gender and identity at that time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRegardless of how Erauso identified, researchers are still divided into different camps on the reason for Erauso's grand story of adventures. Some argue that Erauso had to pretend to be attracted to women in order to keep her identity a secret and to blend in with her fellow Spanish soldiers. Others argue that Erauso was actually a lesbian who used dress as a way to not attract attention from church authorities and to continue to be attracted to women. Still others fall into the third camp that Erauso actually did identify as a man. Those in this school of thought therefore conclude that Erauso was merely expressing their sexual identity through transgenderism.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qAZ5AgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures|last=Haggerty|first=George|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Bonnie|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2003|isbn=9781135578701|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nDespite the existence of her own memoirs, probably published in 1626, Catalina de Erauso ended up disappearing from most known historical records, specifically in the period running between her return to Spain in 1624 and her return to the Indies, until the eighteenth century. At the end of the century, states Sonia Perez-Villanueva, on a certain Sunday Urbir\u00fa she had in her possession a manuscript copy of her memoirs, which was duplicated by a friend, the poet and playwright Candido Maria Trigueros One of the copies made by Trigueros ended up in the hands of the academic [[Juan Bautista Mu\u00f1oz]], who was writing the ''History of the New World'' and included a mention of Catalina in his work. Eventually, the copy was used as a reference by Mu\u00f1oz finished in the hands of the Royal Academy of History in 1784, and later was rediscovered in the early nineteenth century by the political Felipe Bauza, who persuaded his friend, the astronomer and merchant Joaquin Maria Ferrer for publish it. Finally, the manuscript was published in 1829 in Paris by Julio Didot with the title ''story of The Nun Lieutenant, written by herself,'' and a few decades later was republished by Heredia in 1894, marking this version of her autobiography the revival of interest and research into her life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2011-09-16-hernandez-en.html#footNote6|title=From Spain to the Americas, from the convent to the front: Catalina de Erauso's shifting identities - Isabel Hern\u00e1ndez|last=|first=|date=|website=www.eurozine.com|publisher=|access-date=17 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://148.206.53.84/tesiuami/UAMI11565.pdf|title=An\u00e1lisis hist\u00f3rico y literario de Vida i sucesos de la monja alf\u00e9rez, do\u00f1a Catalina de Erauso|last=Guadalupe S\u00e1nchez Rodr\u00edguez|first=Sandra|date=|website=|publisher=Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana Iztapalapa|access-date=July 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe character of The Nun Lieutenant was, and remains today, a source of inspiration for writers, playwrights, filmmakers and artists (most notably her 1630 portrait, attributed to [[Juan van der Hamen]]).

And similarly it has been a source of inspiration for many analysis and academic papers trying to explain her complex personality. In the twentieth century the Monja Alferez hit the screens and became more popular through several film versions, as in ''La Monja Alferez,'' directed by Mexican Emilio G\u00f3mez Muriel (1947). At present, this character is attractive to the poststructuralist critique because she is a clear example of instability and relativity of the notion of gender in the construction of the identity of an individual.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{es}} ''Historia de la monja alf\u00e9rez escrita por ella misma.''

A century of apathy followed, with the museum used as an apple shed among other functions; but in 1949 it was made the home of the Art Society of Tasmania, who rescued the building.<ref>\nhttp://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/L/Lady%20Franklin%20Museum.htm</ref> It is now known as the Lady Franklin Gallery.\n\n==Following the disappearance of her husband==\n[[File:Lady Franklin Cape, Memoirs Bishop Museum, Vol. VII, Plate II.jpg|thumb|Lady Franklin's ''[[\u02bbahu\u02bbula]]'', a Hawaiian feather cape presented to her by King [[Kamehameha IV]] during her visit in 1861, [[Bishop Museum]].]]\nHer husband started on his last voyage in May 1845, and when it was realized that he must have come to disaster, Lady Franklin devoted herself for many years to trying to ascertain his fate. Until shortly before her own death, Lady Franklin travelled extensively, generally accompanied by her husband's niece Sophia Cracroft, who remained her secretary and [[lady's companion|companion]] until her death. Lady Franklin travelled to [[Out Stack]] in [[Shetland]], the northernmost of the British isles, to get as close as she could to her missing husband.\n\nLady Franklin sponsored seven expeditions to find her husband or his records (two of which failed to reach the Arctic):\n* 1850 ''[[Ketch Prince Albert|Prince Albert]]'' under [[Charles Codrington Forsyth]] and [[William Parker Snow]],\n* 1851 ''Prince Albert'' under [[William Kennedy (explorer)|William Kennedy]] and [[Joseph Ren\u00e9 Bellot]],\n* 1852 ''[[Auxiliary Steamship Isabel (1850)|Isabel]]'' (one under Donald Beatson aborted, the other under [[Edward Inglefield]] explored [[Greenland]]),\n* 1853 ''Isabel'' (William Kennedy and Robert Grate, aborted),\n* 1857 ''[[Fox (ship)|Fox]]'' under [[Francis Leopold McClintock]], and\n* 1875 ''[[USS Jeannette (1878)|Pandora]]'' under [[Allen Young]].\nBy means of sponsorship, use of influence and by offering sizeable rewards for information about him, she instigated or supported many other searches. Her efforts made the expedition's fate one of the most vexed questions of the decade. Ultimately evidence was found by Francis McClintock in 1859 that Sir John had died twelve years previously in 1847. Prior accounts had suggested that, in the end, the expedition had turned to [[cannibalism]] to survive, but Lady Franklin refused to believe these stories and poured scorn on explorer [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]], who had in fact been the first person to return with definite news of her husband's fate.\n\nThe popularity of the Franklins in the Australian colonies  was such that when it was learned in 1852 that Lady Franklin was organising an expedition in search of her husband using the auxiliary steamship ''[[Auxiliary Steamship Isabel (1850)|Isabel]]'', subscriptions were taken up and those in Van Diemens Land alone totalled \u00a31671 13/4.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2958286 |title=LOCAL. |newspaper=[[The Courier (Hobart)|The Courier (Hobart, Tas. : 1840 - 1859)]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=27 October 1852 |accessdate=5 August 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAlthough McClintock had found conclusive evidence that Sir John Franklin and his fellow expeditioners were dead, Lady Franklin remained convinced that their written records might remain buried in a cache in the Arctic. She provided moral and some financial support for some later expeditions that planned to seek the records, including those of [[William Parker Snow]] <ref>Trevelyan, Raleigh, ''A Pre-Raphaelite Circle'', Chatto and Windus, 1978, ISBN 0-7011-1885-7</ref>  and [[Charles Francis Hall]] <ref>Chauncey C. Loomis, ''Weird and Tragic Shores: The Story of Charles Francis Hall, Explorer'', New York, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc, 1971.</ref> in the 1860s.  Finally, in 1874 she joined forces with [[Allen Young]] to purchase and fit out the former steam gunboat HMS ''[[USS Jeannette (1878)|Pandora]]'' to undertake another expedition to the region around [[Prince of Wales Island (Nunavut)|Prince of Wales Island]].  The expedition left London in June 1875, and returned in December, unsuccessful, as ice prevented her from passing west of the [[Franklin Strait]].\n\nLady Franklin died in the interim, on 18 July 1875.  At her funeral on 29 July, the pall-bearers included Captains McClintock, [[Richard Collinson|Collinson]] and [[Erasmus Ommanney|Ommanney]], R.N., while many other \"Old Arctics\" engaged in the Franklin searches were also in attendance. She was interred at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in the vault, and commemorated on a marble cross dedicated to her niece Sophia Cracroft.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nLady Franklin was a woman of unusual character and personality. Her determined efforts, in connection with which she spent a great deal of her own money to discover the fate of her husband, added much to the world's knowledge of the arctic regions. It was said: 'What the nation would not do, a woman did'. In addition, as one of the earliest women in Tasmania who had had the full benefit of education and cultural surroundings, she was both an example and a force, and set a new standard in ways of living to the more prosperous settlers who had past the stage of merely struggling for a living.\n\nNatural features named after her include [[Lady Franklin Bay]], on [[Ellesmere Island]] in [[Nunavut]]; [[Lady Franklin Rock]], an island in the Fraser River near [[Yale, British Columbia]], named at the end of her visit there during the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]]; [[Lady Franklin Rock (Yosemite)|Lady Franklin Rock]], near [[Vernal Fall]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] in California; and Mount Lady Jane Franklin, a hill near Barnawartha in Northern Victoria, which she climbed on her trip from Port Phillip to Sydney in 1839.\n\n[[Jane Franklin Hall]], a residential college in [[Hobart, Tasmania]], is named in her honour, as is the art gallery mentioned above. The ballad ''[[Lady Franklin's Lament]]'' commemorated her search for her lost husband.\n\nMost of Lady Franklin's surviving papers are held by the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* Founder's Gold Medal, the Royal Geographical Society<ref>{{cite news |first=Kenn |last=Harper |title=Taissumani: A Day in Arctic History Dec.&nbsp;4, 1791, The Birth of Jane Griffin, the Future Lady Franklin |url=http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/61222/opinionEditorial/columns.html |work= |publisher=Nunatsiaq.com |date=1 December 2006 |accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref>\n\nThe biography \"The Ambitions of Jane Franklin\" by Tasmanian historian [[Alison Alexander]] won the 2014 [[National Biography Award]].<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books/rivers-run-deep-for-lady-of-letters-alison-alexanders-national-biography-award/story-e6frg8nf-1227013355972 \"Rivers run deep for lady of letters\"], [[The Australian]], 5 August 2014, page 4</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Lady Franklin's Revenge]]'', a history of explorations of the Arctic funded by Lady Franklin\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=5011 Biography at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']\n* Frances J.

While not the [[Jeanne Bar\u00e9|first woman to circumnavigate the world]], she was the first to record her experiences, in a diary. Being not intended for publication and being both frank and personal musings  about people, places and events, her writings represent an important anthropological resource.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nDe Freycinet was born Rose Pinon in [[Saint-Julien-du-Sault]], in the [[Yonne]] department, to a middle-class family. Her mother was possibly called Jeanne Pinon; the name of her father is not known today. Jeanne Pinon ran a boarding school for girls. Rose was educated in that school, along with some 40 young ladies from [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Rivi\u00e8re\">{{cite book|last=Rivi\u00e8re|first=Marc Serge|title=A woman of courage: The journal of Rose de Freycinet on her voyage around the world, 1817-1820|year=2003|publisher=National Library Australia|isbn=978-0-642-10767-1|pages=xi-xxiv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7vI0BbFLlkC&pg=PR13}}</ref>\n\nRose was the oldest daughter. Her father died while she was relatively young, followed by her brother, leaving Rose with the responsibility of looking after her sisters. She had a younger sister, St\u00e9phanie, who later also took to the sea and sailed for [[Mauritius]] in 1818; St\u00e9phanie married a civil servant, M. Maillard, who later repudiated her.<ref name=\"Rivi\u00e8re\"/>\n\n===Marriage to de Freycinet===\n[[File:Louis Claude de Saulces de Freycinet.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Louis de Freycinet]]\nAt age 19, Rose married 35-year-old Louis Claude de Saulces de Freycinet, a member of the French aristocracy. The difference in social class proved no impediment for a happy marriage; by all accounts her in-laws loved and respected her, and throughout her life Rose maintained an animated correspondence with her in-laws, wherever her travels took her.<ref name=\"Rivi\u00e8re\"/>\n\n===Aboard the ''Uranie''===\nLouis de Freycinet had earlier  participated in the Baudin voyage that produced the first map of the [[Australia]]n coastline in the period 1801-3. It is on that voyage he would have been aware of   his leader Nicolas Baudin's meeting with [[Matthew Flinders]] and of their virtually simultaneous proving that  New Holland of the Dutch  and New South Wales of Cook  were part of one island continent Australia. Displaying considerable cartographic skill, when  Baudin's second ship was sent home under [[Jacques F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Hamelin|Jacques Hamelin]] laden with specimens and records, de Freycinet  was elevated above others to command {{ship||Casuarina|schooner|2}}, a small vessel purchased in order to continue  the surveys. After finalising an account of the voyage after the death of  both Baudin and the voyage anthropologist Fran\u00e7ois Peron who attempted to complete the account,   in 1817 he was given command of the ''Uranie'' on an expedition under the auspices of the [[French Navy]] and the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]], in which [[Louis Isidore Duperrey]], [[Jacques Arago]], [[Adrien Taunay the Younger]], and others went to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to perform various scientific measurements and to collect specimens in natural history. Newly married to Rose Pinon and perhaps aware of  Flinder's imprisonment and his enforced separation from his wife Ann,  they conspired to avoid a similar fate aboard. Dressed in men's clothes; Rose deFreycinet became the first woman to write an account of her experiences circumnavigating the world.<ref name=\"mccarthy\">{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Michael|title=Rose de Freycinet and the French Exploration Corvette ''L\u2019Uranie'' (1820): a Highlight of the 'French Connection' with the 'Great Southland'|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archeology|year=2005|volume=34|issue=1|pages=62\u201378|doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.2005.00044.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rose de Freycinet, 1817-1820|url=http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/exhibitions/journeys/The_Explorers/Rose_de_Freycinet.html|work=Journeys of Enlightenment: French Exploration of Terres Australes|publisher=[[Western Australian Museum]]|accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nTo prepare the ship for his wife's presence, de Freycinet had the living quarters of the [[corvette]] renovated (they were refurbished and extended, even at the expense of the ship's navigability), and much attention was paid to hygienic standards aboard the ship, food safety, and health. Apparently, becoming a stowaway was Rose's own idea; she may have hatched the plan as early as 1815, and probably solidified her scheme after her husband received approval for the expedition, in October 1816. She went on board<!--for what?  a visit?  the expedition did not begin until the next year--> on 16 September 1817; report of her presence reached the French media soon after, leading to sensational reports in the press and \"indignation in official circles.\" The presence of women aboard Navy vessels was illegal, and it is possible that the Navy, the Ministry of the Interior, and the press learned of Rose's presence from an officer who was removed to make way for her. At any rate, Rose initially dressed as a man, and even visited the governor of [[Gibraltar]] dressed in \"a blue frock-coat with trousers to match.\"<ref name=\"Rivi\u00e8re\"/>\n\nThe Navy was powerless, since the first French port of call for the ''Uranie'' was [[R\u00e9union]], in the [[Indian Ocean]], which was not reached until 1818. When the ship did land there, the local governor was unable or unwilling to act, swayed as he was, according to Rose, by her husband's arguments and her charm. A court martial that investigated the shipwreck, in 1820, never mentioned Rose's presence.<ref name=\"Rivi\u00e8re\"/>\n\nThe expedition brought back a great number of scientific specimens, including minerals, plants, insects, animals, despite the shipwreck of the ''Uranie'' in 1820 in the [[Falkland Islands]]. According to Jacques Arago, the artist who had been hired to do botanical and other illustrations and who was the only civilian on board, during the shipwreck Rose de Freycinet behaved herself admirably.<ref name=\"Rivi\u00e8re\"/> Her diary, however, was not published until 1927.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freycinet|first=Rose de|title=Journal de Madame Rose de Saulces de Freycinet, d'apr\u00e8s le manuscrit original accompagn\u00e9 de notes|year=1927|publisher=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Editions G\u00e9ographiques, Maritimes et Coloniales|location=Paris|editor=Charles Duplomb}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nIn Paris, 1832, Louis fell ill with [[cholera]].

Her early life was uneventful, and she lived there until her marriage on 21 April 1806 to [[Jean-Baptiste Lagimodi\u00e8re]]. Lagimodi\u00e8re was originally from nearby [[Saint-Ours, Quebec|Saint-Ours]]; he had become a [[Coureur des bois]] employed in the [[fur trade]] by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in [[Rupert's Land]].\n\n== Travels in the west ==\n\nImmediately following their marriage, and in defiance of the custom of the time, Gaboury travelled to the west with her new husband.  They went first to the area near the confluence of the [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] and [[Red River of the North|Red Rivers]] near what would later become the [[Red River Colony]], and, eventually, modern [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. They wintered at a [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] encampment near [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]], [[North Dakota]], where the first of her eight children was born on 6 January 1807.\n\nThe following spring, the Lagimodi\u00e8res travelled to the valley of the [[Saskatchewan River]], settling eventually in what is now northern [[Saskatchewan]], where they remained until 1811, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle among other French-Canadian trappers and their native wives. During this period, Marie-Anne accompanied her husband on many trapping and [[American bison|buffalo]] hunting expeditions, often venturing as far west as present-day [[Alberta]]. Her second child was born on the open [[prairie]] shortly after her horse had bolted towards a herd of buffalo, and on another occasion she fought and shot a large [[bear]] that had attacked one of their companions.\n\nThe young family was once taken prisoner while trapping by [[Tsuu T'ina]] tribesmen because of their association with local [[Cree]]. Although they managed to escape on horseback, they were pursued for five days until reaching the safety of Fort des Prairie (also known as Fort Augustus, a counterpart to [[Fort Edmonton]]) near modern [[Edmonton, Alberta]].\n\nBefore his marriage, Jean-Baptiste had previously been involved [[marriage '\u00e0 la fa\u00e7on du pays'|\"\u00e0 la fa\u00e7on du pays\"]] [in the style of the country] with a native woman who had borne his children. Marie-Anne was tolerant and accepting of the children arising from this previous relationship, although the other woman was jealous and reportedly threatened to poison her. Despite this incident, the Lagimodi\u00e8res generally had good relationships with the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] they encountered. Marie-Anne was often regarded as an object of curiosity by the Natives during her travels, as she was invariably the first white woman they had ever seen &ndash; some were even led to believe that she possessed supernatural powers.\n\n== Return to the Red River ==\n\nOn hearing that [[Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk|Lord Selkirk]] was establishing a permanent colony at the Red River, they returned to help establish the new [[Red River Colony]] in the spring of 1812. The early history of the settlement was characterized by struggles between the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and its rival, the [[North West Company]], culminating in the [[Battle of Seven Oaks (1816)|Battle of Seven Oaks]] in 1816. Although the Lagimodi\u00e8res managed to avoid involvement with the violent confrontations, Jean-Baptiste was asked by HBC representative [[Colin Robertson (fur trader)|Colin Robertson]] to take news of the events to Lord Selkirk. Over the winter of 1815\u20131816, Lagimodi\u00e8re travelled over 2,900 kilometers on horseback and on foot in fulfillment of this mission. During this time, Marie-Anne was obliged to seek shelter among the aboriginal tribes when the Nor'Westers took possession of [[Fort Douglas (Canada)|Fort Douglas]]. On his return from the east, Jean-Baptiste was taken prisoner by the Nor'Westers and was imprisoned in [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] until August 1816. The Lagimodi\u00e8res were not reunited until September 1816, after the unrest had subsided.\n\nIn recognition of his service, Lord Selkirk awarded Jean-Baptiste a tract of land near the Red River, which the Lagimodi\u00e8res successfully homesteaded for many years. They had six more children, including, in 1822, Julie Lagimodi\u00e8re, the future mother of [[Louis Riel]].

Along with her husband [[\u00deorfinnur Karlsefni]], they led an expedition to [[Vinland]] where they begat their son [[Snorri \u00deorfinnsson]], the first European born in the [[Americas]] outside of [[Greenland]].\n\nIn Iceland, Gudrid is known by her byname ''v\u00ed\u00f0f\u00f6rla'' (lit. ''wide-fared'' or ''far-travelled''). \n\n==Biography==\nAs recorded in ''The Saga of Eirik the Red'', Gudrid was the daughter of a chieftain by the name of Thorbjorn of Laugarbrekka. As the story goes, a young man by the name of Einar asked for her hand in marriage, but because his father was a slave, Gudrid\u2019s father refused to give her hand in marriage.  Gudrid and her father promptly left Iceland and voyaged to Greenland to accompany [[Eric the Red|Eirik the Red]]. Thirty others went with them on the journey, but the group experienced complications due to poor weather, which slowed their progress during the summer. After this setback, illness plagued the group and half of the company died. Despite these failures, Gudrid and her father landed safely in Greenland in the winter.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gwyn|title=Eirik the Red: And Other Icelandic Sagas.|year=1961|publisher=Oxford UP|location=London}}</ref> Although it is not mentioned in ''The Saga of Eirik the Red'', according to the ''[[Saga of the Greenlanders]]'', at the time Gudrid was married to a Norwegian merchant named Thorir.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sigurosson|first=Gisli|title=The Vinland Sagas: The Icelandic Sagas about the First Documented Voyages across the North Atlantic|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=London}}</ref> According to this account, [[Leif Eirikson]] rescued Gudrid and fifteen men from a [[skerry]], brought them safely to [[Brattahlid]], and invited Thorir and Gudrid to stay there with him. That winter, Thorir died of illness.\n\nAccording to both sagas, Gudrid then married [[Thorstein Eiriksson]], [[Leif Eiriksson]]'s younger brother and [[Eric the Red|Eirik the Red]]'s son. According to the ''Saga of the Greenlanders'', Gudrid then accompanied her husband on his quest to [[Vinland]], with the hope that he could retrieve the body of his brother Thorvald. The two spent the winter in Lysufjord with a man by the name of Thorstein the Black and his wife Grimhild, but illness soon struck the group and both Grimhild and Gudrid\u2019s husband Thorstein died. According to this account, Thorstein temporarily rises from his dead bed to tell Gudrid that she will be married to an Icelander, and that they will have a long life together with many descendants. He stated that she would leave [[Greenland]] to go to [[Norway]] and then [[Iceland]], and after a pilgrimage south, she would return to Iceland, where a church would be built near her farm.  According to the ''Saga of Eirik the Red'', Thorstein makes the voyage to Vinland by himself, and it is only upon his return that the two marry. According to the Saga, \u201cThorstein had a farm and livestock in the western settlement at a place called Lysufjord\u201d and another man by the name of Thorstein (whose wife in this version is named Sigrid) owned a half-share on this farm. The couple moved to the farm and, like in the ''Saga of the Greenlanders'', Thorstein died and told Gudrid of her future, although in this version he focuses more on the importance of [[Christianity]], asking Gudrid to \u201cdonate their money to a church or poor people.\u201d <ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gwyn|title=Eirik the Red: And Other Icelandic Sagas.|year=1961|publisher=Oxford UP|location=London}}</ref>\n\nAfter his death, Gudrid moved back to [[Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0]], where she married a merchant named [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]], who is described in the ''Saga of Eirik the Red'' as being \u201ca man of good family and good means\u201d and \u201ca merchant of good repute\u201d. According to ''The Saga of the Greenlanders'', after their marriage, and at Gudrid\u2019s urging, the two led an attempt to settle V\u00ednland with sixty men, five women, and a cargo of various livestock (while it is implied in ''The Saga of Eirik the Red'' that she accompanies him, Gudrid is never actually mentioned in the account of the journey).  While in V\u00ednland, the couple had a son whom they named [[Snorri Thorfinnsson]], who is the first European reported to be born in the Western Hemisphere.  Shortly after Snorri was born, the family traveled back to Greenland. According to ''The Saga of Eirik the Red'', the couple had another son named Thorbjorn. Although it is only mentioned in ''The Saga of the Greenlanders'', Thorfin died, leaving Gudrid to live as a widow.<ref>{{cite book|last=Logan|first=Donald|title=The Vikings in History: Third Edition|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n[[Christianisation of Iceland]] during this period meant that religious conversions were common.<ref>[http://www.arnastofnun.is/page/the_history_of_christianization ''Christianisation of Iceland'' (\u00c1rni Magn\u00fasson Institute for Icelandic Studies) ]</ref>  Gudrid converted to Christianity and, when Snorri married, went on a pilgrimage to [[Rome]]. While some have discussed the possibility that Gudrid spoke with the [[Pope]] on her journey, there is no proof of it.  While she was away, Snorri built a church near the estate, fulfilling the prediction that [[Thorstein Eiriksson|Thorstein]] had made.

She told Rob her dream on their honeymoon, and had only six-weeks sailing experience at the time. [[Chay Blyth]] lent her the boat ''Spirit of Cutty Sark'' (later renamed ''Express Crusader''), other people raised money for supplies, and the ''[[Daily Express]]'' raised sponsorship money.

She was the first woman back and broke the women's speed record with a time of 25 days, 19 hours. Rob also competed in that race, finishing twelfth in the trimaran Boatfile.\n\nShe gave up sailing in 1982 after winning the two thousand mile [[Round Britain and Ireland double handed Yacht Race|Round Britain Race]] with her husband Rob James, because she suffered badly from sea sickness during that voyage (possibly augmented by morning sickness due to her pregnancy).

She came from a family of writers, as she was also the niece of novelists [[Charles Kingsley]] and [[Henry Kingsley]]. The family moved to [[Highgate]] less than a year after her birth, the same home where her brother Charles George R. (\"Charley\") Kingsley was born in 1866, and by 1881 were living in Southwood House, [[Bexley]] in [[Kent]].\n\nHer father was a doctor and worked for [[George Herbert, 13th Earl of Pembroke]] and other aristocrats and was regularly away from home on his excursions. During these voyages he collected information for his studies. Dr. Kingsley accompanied [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|Lord Dunraven]] on a trip to North America in 1870-1875. During this trip, Dr. Kingsley was invited to accompany [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]]'s U.S. Army expedition against the [[Sioux]] Indians. The reported [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|massacre of Custer's force]] terrified the Kingsley family, but they were relieved to learn that bad weather had kept Dr. Kingsley from joining Custer. It is possible that her father's views on injustices faced by the Native Americans helped shape Mary's later opinions on British [[cultural imperialism]] in West Africa.{{sfn|Frank|2006|pp=37-38}}\n\nIn terms of Kingsley's education, she had little formal schooling compared to her brother, other than German lessons at a young age;{{sfn|Gwynn|Rattray|1932|p=}} because, at that time, and at her level of society, education was not thought to be necessary for a girl.{{sfn|Wilcox|1975|p=173}}  She did, however, have access to her father's large library and loved to hear her father's stories of foreign countries.{{sfn|Frank|2006|p=28}} She did not enjoy novels that were deemed more appropriate for young ladies of the time, such as those by [[Jane Austen]] or [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] but preferred books on the sciences and memoirs of explorers. In 1886, her brother Charley entered [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], to study law; this allowed Mary to make several academic connections and a few friends.\n\nWith respect to religion, there is little indication that Kingsley was raised [[Christian]]; instead, she was a self-proclaimed believer with, \"summed up in her own word [...] 'an utter faith in God'\" and even identified strongly with what was described as 'the' African religion'.{{sfn|Gwynn|Rattray|1932|p=362}} She is known for criticizing Christian missionaries and their work for taking away African culture without proving any real benefits in return.{{sfn |Kingsley|Brandt|2002|p=xiv}}\n\nThe 1891 England [[census]] finds Mrs. Kingsley - Mary's mother - and her two children living at 7 Mortimer Road, [[Cambridge]], where Charles is recorded as a BA Student at Law and Mary as a Student of Medicine.\n\nIn her later years, Kingsley's mother became ill, and she was expected to care for her well-being. Unable to leave her mother's side, she was limited in her travel opportunities. Soon, her father was also bedridden with rheumatic fever following an excursion. Dr. Kingsley died in February 1892, and Mrs. Kingsley followed a few months later in April of the same year. \"Freed\" from her family responsibilities and with an inheritance of \u00a38,600 to be split evenly with her brother, Kingsley was now able to travel as she had always dreamed.{{sfn |Frank|2006|p=57}} Mary decided to visit Africa, some say to finish collecting material for a book that her father had started on African culture.\n\n== Journeys to Africa ==\n\nAfter a preliminary visit to the [[Canary Islands]], Kingsley decided to travel to the west coast of Africa. Generally, the only non-African women who embarked on (often dangerous) journeys to Africa were the wives of [[missionaries]], government officials, or explorers. Exploration and adventure were not seen as fitting roles for [[women in the Victorian era]]. African women were surprised that a woman of Mary's age was travelling without a man, as she was frequently asked why her husband was not accompanying her.\n\nMary landed in [[Sierra Leone]] on 17 August 1893 and pressed on into [[Luanda]] in [[Angola]]. She lived with local people, who taught her necessary skills for surviving in the African jungles and gave her advice. She often went into dangerous areas alone. Her training as a nurse at the [[Kaiserworth Medical Institute]] had prepared her for slight injuries and jungle maladies that she would later encounter. Mary returned to England in December 1893.\n\nUpon her return, Kingsley secured support and aid from Dr. [[Albert G\u00fcnther]], a prominent zoologist at the [[British Museum]], as well as a writing agreement with publisher [[George Macmillan]], for she wished to publish her travel accounts.\n\nShe returned to Africa yet again in December 23, 1894 with more support and supplies from England, as well as increased self-assurance in her work. She longed to study '[[cannibal]]' people and their traditional religious practices, commonly referred to as '[[fetishism|fetish]]' during the Victorian Era. In April, she became acquainted with Scottish missionary [[Mary Slessor]], another female living among native populations with little company and no husband. It was during her meeting with Slessor that Kingsley first became aware of the custom of twin killing, a custom which Slessor was determined to stop. The native people believed that one of the twins was the offspring of the devil who had secretly mated with the mother and since the innocent child was impossible to distinguish, both were killed and the mother was often killed as well for attracting the devil to impregnate her. Kingsley arrived at Slessor's residence shortly after she had taken in a recent mother of twins and her surviving child.{{sfn|Frank|2006|pp=130-131}}\n\nLater in [[Gabon]], Mary Kingsley [[canoe]]d up the [[Ogoou\u00e9 River]], where she collected specimens of previously unknown fish, three of which were later named after her. After meeting the [[Beti-Pahuin#Fang|Fang]] people and travelling through uncharted Fang territory, she daringly climbed the {{convert|4040|m}} [[Mount Cameroon]] by a route not previously attempted by any other European. She moored her boat at [[Donguila]].{{sfn|Alexander|1990|p=254}}\n\n== Return to England ==\n\nWhen she returned home in November 1895, Kingsley was greeted by journalists, who were eager to interview her. The reports that were drummed up about her voyage, however, were most upsetting, as the papers portrayed her as a \"[[New Woman]],\" an image which she did not embrace. Kingsley distanced herself from any feminist movement claims, arguing that [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] was \"a minor question; while there was a most vital section of men disenfranchised women could wait\".{{sfn |Flint|1963|p=96}} Her consistent lack of identification with women's rights movements may be attributed to a number of causes, such as the attempt to ensure that her work was received more favorably; in fact, some insist this may be a direct reference to her belief in the importance of securing rights of British traders in West Africa{{sfn |Flint|1963|p=95-104}}\n\nOver the next three years, she toured the country giving lectures about life in Africa to a wide array of audiences. She was the first woman to address the [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]] chambers of commerce.{{sfn|Matthew|Harrison|2004|p=713}}\n\nMary Kingsley upset the [[Church of England]] when she criticised [[missionaries]] for attempting to convert the people of Africa and corrupt their religion. In this regard, she discussed many aspects of African life that were shocking to English people, including [[polygamy]], which, she argued was practiced out of necessity.{{sfn |Kingsley|Brandt|2002|loc=Introduction}} After living with the African people, Kingsley became directly aware how their societies functioned and how prohibiting customs such as polygamy would be detrimental to their way of life. She knew that the typical African wives had too many tasks to manage alone. Missionaries in Africa often required converted men to abandon all but one of their wives, leaving the other women and children without the support of a husband \u2013thus creating immense social and economic problems.{{sfn|Frank|2006|pp=157-159}}\n\nKingsley's beliefs about cultural and [[economic imperialism]] are complex and still widely debated by scholars today. Though, on the one hand, she regarded African people and cultures as those who needed protection and preservation,{{sfn |Kingsley|Brandt|2002|loc=Introduction}} she also believed in the necessity of British economic and technological influence and [[indirect rule]], insisting that there was some work in West Africa that had to be completed by white men.{{sfn|Kingsley| 1897|p = 454}} Yet, in Studies in West Africa she writes: \"Although a Darwinian to the core, I doubt if evolution in a neat and tidy perpendicular line, with Fetish at the bottom and Christianity at the top, represents the true state of affairs.\"{{sfn|Kingsley| 1901|p = 101}} Other, more acceptable, beliefs were variously perceived and used in Western European society - by traders, imperialists, women's rights activists and others - and, articulated as they were in great style, helped shape popular perception of \"the African\" and \"his\" land.\n\n== Publications ==\n\nKingsley wrote two books about her experiences: ''Travels in West Africa'' (1897), which was an immediate best-seller, and ''West African Studies'' (1899), both of which granted her vast respect and prestige within the scholarly community. Some newspapers, however, refused to publish reviews of her works, such as the ''[[Times of London|Times]]'' colonial editor [[Flora Shaw]]. Though some argue this is likely on the grounds that her beliefs countered the imperialistic intentions of the [[British Empire]] and the notion that Africans were inferior peoples, this is not entirely true, as she did support British traders and British indirect rule in Africa,{{sfn |Flint|1963|p=96}}{{sfn|Gwynn|Rattray|1932|p=}} and thus cannot entirely explain her sometimes unfavorable reception.\n\nThe notable success of ''Travels in West Africa'' was due in no small part to the vigour and droll humour of writing, that, in the guise of a ripping yarn, never wavers from its true purpose - to complete the work her father had left undone. Between poles of manifest wit and latent analysis Kingsley constructs, in images --  \"\u2026 not an artist\u2019s picture, but a photograph, an overladen with detail, colourless version\"{{sfn|Kingsley| 1901|p = xi}} \u2014a discourse of poetic thought; a phenomenon often noted in the texts of [[Walter Benjamin]]. Of her method she said: \"It is merely that I have the power of bringing out in my fellow-creatures, white or black, their virtues, in a way honourable to them and fortunate for me.\"{{sfn|Kingsley| 1901|p = viii}} Of her purpose she said: \"[M]y motive for going to West Africa was study; this study was that of native ideas and practices in religion and law. My reason for taking up this study was a desire to complete a great book my father, George Kingsley, had left at his death unfinished.\"{{sfn|Kingsley| 1901|p = xi}} Of her father she said: \"The work that he did seemed to promise a career of great brilliancy and distinction \u2013 a promise which, unfortunately, was never entirely fulfilled.\"{{sfn|Kingsley|Kingsley|1900|p=22}} In truth George Kingsley produced but a few scattered fragments, not a scrap of which found its way into the great book of Mary Kingsley. It is, rather, in the text of his daughter that the dream wish of the father is finally accomplished; and family honour sustained.\n\n===Published works===\n*{{cite journal|last1=Kingsley|first1=M.

She was stationed at [[Simon's Town]] hospital, where she treated Boer prisoners of war. After contributing her services to the ill for about two months, she developed symptoms of [[typhoid]] and died on 3 June 1900. An eyewitness reported: \"She rallied for a short time but realised she was going. She asked to be left to die alone, saying she did not wish anyone to see her in her weakness. Animals she said, went away to die alone.\"{{sfn|Gwynn|1940|p=}} In accordance with her wishes, she was buried at sea.{{sfn|Matthew|Harrison|2004|p=714}}  \"This was, I believe, the only favour and distinction that she ever asked for herself; and it was accorded with every circumstance and honour. \u2026 A party of West Yorkshires, with band before them, drew the coffin from the hospital on a gun carriage to the pier \u2026 Torpedo Boat No. 29  [] put to sea and, rounding Cape Point, committed her to the element in which she had chosen to be laid.\"{{sfn|Gwynn|1940|p=}} \"A touch of comedy, which would 'have amused' Kingsley herself, was added when the coffin refused to sink and had to be hauled back on board then thrown over again weighed down this time with an anchor.\"{{sfn |Frank|2006|pp=298-299}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nKingsley's tales and opinions of life in Africa helped draw attention to British imperial agendas abroad and the native customs of African people that were previously little discussed or misunderstood by the European masses. The Fair Commerce Party formed soon after her death, pressuring for improved conditions for the natives of British colonies. Various reform associations were formed in her honour and helped facilitate governmental change. The [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] founded an honorary medal in her name.\n\nKingsley House in [[Achimota School]], in Ghana was also named in her honour.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of female adventurers]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Alexander|first=Caroline |title=One dry season: in the footsteps of Mary Kingsley|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F_NEAAAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-394-57455-4}}\n*{{cite journal|last1=Flint|first1=J.E.|title=Mary Kingsley \u2014 a reassessment|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=4|issue=01|year=2009|pages=95|issn=0021-8537|doi=10.1017/S002185370000373X|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Frank|first=Katherine |title=A Voyager Out: The Life of Mary Kingsley|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q4MkSqMk8SYC|year=2006|publisher=Tauris Parke|isbn=978-1-84511-020-8}}\n*{{Cite journal | title = The Life of Mary Kingsley  | last = Gwynn | first = Stephen|author-link1=Stephen Gwynn | last2 = Rattray | first2 = R.

During that time she spent nearly thirty years researching in the Polar Regions and become the first woman scientist to do research in [[Antarctica]]. She joined in the [[1st Soviet Antarctic Expedition|First Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] (1955-57) and worked with [[ANARE]] (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) at [[Macquarie Island]].\n\n==Career==\n\nKlenova began her marine geology career in 1925 as a researcher aboard the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] research vessel ''[[Perseus (Soviet ship)|Perseus]]'', attached to the Floating Marine Research Institute (precursor to the present-day [[Nikolai M. Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography]]) in the [[Barents Sea]] and the archipelagos of [[Novaya Zemlya]], [[Spitsbergen]], and [[Franz Josef Land]]. In 1933 Klenova produced the first complete seabed map of the Barents Sea.  She identified and named the Barents abyssal plain (85\u00baN, 40\u00baE) after the Dutch polar explorer [[Willem Barentsz]] (or Barents) who died in 1597 on his third expedition to find the Northeast Passage. \n\nIn 1949 Klenova became a senior research associate at the [[Shirshov Institute of Oceanology]] of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]]. Her work included analyses of seabed geology in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Antarctic]], and in the [[Caspian sea|Caspian]], [[Barents Sea|Barents]] and [[White Sea]]s. In the austral summer of 1956 she traveled with a Soviet [[oceanographic]] team to map uncharted areas of the Antarctic coast.\n\nThe Klenova Valley ({{coord|84|36|N|55|00|W|}}), an oceanographic valley discovered in 1981\u20131983 by the USSR [[Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet|Northern Fleet]] Hydrographic Expedition is named after her.<ref name=\"GEBCO\" /> Klenova Seamount, about 450 km east of Salvador, Brazil (13\u00ba01.5' S, 34\u00ba15' W), [[List of craters on Venus|Klenova crater on Venus]] and [[Klenova Peak]] in [[Antarctica]] are also named in her honour.\n==Contributions==\nHer contributions helped to create the first Antarctic atlas, a groundbreaking four-volume work published in the Soviet Union. Klenova spent most of her time making observations on board the Russian [[icebreaker]]s ''Ob'' and ''Lena''.  Her group took oceanographic measurements in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters.  Along with Klenova there were seven other women on board the ''Ob''.  At that time women were rarely allowed to venture on land and had to rely on their male colleagues to collect and bring back data samples.  In between these two voyages she worked at Mirny, a Russian base on the [[Queen Mary Coast]] (which is shared by [[Australian]] and [[Poland|Polish]] Research Stations). On the way home Klenova went to Macquarie Island where she became the first female scientist ever to go ashore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oceanwide-expeditions.com/blog/the-first-woman-and-female-scientists-in-antarctica|title=The first woman and female scientists in Antarctica|website=oceanwide-expeditions.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref>\n\nHer book ''Geologiya Moray'' (Geology of the sea) published in 1948 was the second textbook dedicated to marine geology.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8Ul9OznRW8C|title=Marine Science: Decade by Decade|last=Reed|first=Christina|last2=Cannon|first2=William J.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816055340|language=en}}</ref> \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n* Klenova M.V. and Jastrebova L.A.

She acquired her early interest in sailing, firstly by her desire to emulate her idol at the time, Sophie Burke, and secondly by reading [[Arthur Ransome]]'s ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' of books.

She saved her school dinner money for three years to buy her first boat, an eight-foot dinghy, which she named ''[[Threepence (British coin)|Threp'ny Bit]]'' even though [[decimalisation]] had taken place before she was born.

She was one of the first female [[explorer]]s, whose popular books were translated into seven languages. She was a member of geographical societies of both Berlin and Paris, but not of [[Royal Geographical Society]] in [[London]] due to her sex.\n\n== Early life ==\nThe daughter of a wealthy merchant named Reyer, she was born at [[Vienna]]. As a child, she preferred boys' clothing and liked sports and exercise, which was encouraged by her father. She received the education usually given a boy. Her first long journey was a trip to Palestine and Egypt when she was five years old. The influence of this experience remained with her. Following the death of her father when she was nine, her mother - disapproving this unconventional upbringing - persuaded Ida to wear girls' clothing and to take up piano lessons. After [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], emperor of the French, conquered Vienna in 1809, some of the French troops were quartered in Reyer's home to Ida's dislike. During the grand review held in [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]], she protested against foreign occupation by turning her back as Napoleon rode past.\n\nOn May 1, 1820, she married Dr. Mark Anton Pfeiffer, a lawyer in [[Lemberg]], (now Lviv, [[Ukraine]]) connected with the Austrian government, who was 24 years older than she and a widower with a grown-up son. Dr. Pfeiffer made enemies  by exposing corrupted Austrian officials in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and was forced to resign. Subsequently, he found it difficult to find a job and in order to support her family, and due to their poverty Ida gave drawing and music lessons. The financial situation of the family improved only after the death of her mother in 1831, and with this small inheritance Ida Pfeiffer was able to hire better teachers for her two sons. Her husband died 7 years later in 1838.\n\n== Travels ==\nAfter her sons had homes of their own, Ida Pfeiffer was finally able to fulfill her childhood dream of traveling to foreign places. She later wrote in ''Visit to Iceland'':\n<blockquote>\nWhen I was but a little child, I had already a strong desire to see the world.  Whenever I met a travelling-carriage, I would stop\ninvoluntarily, and gaze after it until it had disappeared; I used even to envy the postilion, for I thought he also must have\naccomplished the whole long journey.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1842 she traveled along the [[Danube]] river to the [[Black Sea]] and [[Istanbul]]. From there she continued to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]] before returning home via [[Italy]].  She published an account of her journey in ''Reise einer Wienerin in das Heilige Land'' (\u201cA Vienna woman's trip to the Holy Land,\u201d 2 vols., Vienna, 1843); money earned from this publication allowed her to pursue more extended explorations in the future. In 1845 she set out to [[Scandinavia]] and [[Iceland]], describing her tour in two volumes, ''Reise nach dem skandinavischen Norden und der Insel Island'' (\u201cTrip to the Scandinavian North and the island of Iceland,\u201d Pest, 1846; English translation: ''Journey to Iceland, Sweden, and Norway'', London, 1852).\n\n=== First trip round the world ===\n\nIn 1846 she started on a journey round the world, visiting [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and other countries of [[South America]], [[Tahiti]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Greece]], and reaching home in 1848. The results were published in ''Eine Frau f\u00e4hrt um die Welt'' (3 vols., Vienna, 1850; English translation: ''A Woman's Journey round the World'', London, 1850).\n\n=== Second trip round the world ===\n\nIn 1851 she went to [[England]] and to [[South Africa]], intending to penetrate into the interior; this proved impracticable, but she proceeded to the [[Malay archipelago]], spending eighteen months in the [[Sunda Islands]], where she visited the [[Dayak people|Dyaks]] of [[Borneo]] and was one of the first persons to report on the behavior of the [[Batak (Indonesia)|Bataks]] in [[Sumatra]], and the [[Maluku Islands|Malukus]]. After a visit to [[Australia]], Madame Pfeiffer proceeded to [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Republic of the New Granada|New Granada]], and north again to the [[Great Lakes]], reaching home in 1854. Her narrative, ''Meine zweite Weltreise'' (\u201cMy second trip around the world\u201d), was published at Vienna in 1856 (English translation: ''Second Journey round the World'', London, 1857).\n\n=== Madagascar ===\n\nIn May 1857 she set out to explore [[Madagascar]], where at first she was cordially received by the queen [[Ranavalona I]]. She unwittingly allowed herself to be involved in a plot to overthrow the government together with a few other Europeans, namely [[Jean Laborde]] and [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]] in apparent collaboration with crown prince Rakoto (the future king [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]]). Upon learning of the attempted coup, the queen executed the Malagasy involved but spared the Europeans, whom she expelled from the country in July 1857. Pfeiffer contracted a disease (likely malaria) during her passage from the capital of [[Antananarivo]] to the coastal port of departure and never fully recovered. She died in Vienna a year later in 1858, likely from malaria complications. A travelogue describing her final voyage, ''Reise nach Madagaskar'' (\u201cTrip to Madagascar\u201d), was published in Vienna in 1861 in 2 volumes and included a biography written by her son Oskar Pfeiffer.\n\n[[Image:Ida Pfeiffer Dauthage.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Ida Pfeiffer dressed for a collection foray with an insect net and a specimen container slung over her shoulder]]\n\n== Natural History ==\nDuring her travels Ida Pfeiffer collected plants, insects, mollusks, marine life and mineral specimens. The carefully documented specimens were sold to the [[Naturhistorisches Museum]] in Vienna and [[Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde]] in Berlin.\n\n== Influences ==\n-Madame Pfeiffer is referenced as Madam Pfeiffer in Thoreau's book, Walden.  Thoreau talks of how she wore more civilized clothes as she got closer to her homeland.\n==Notes==\n{{No footnotes|date=July 2013}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Pfeiffer, Ida Laura}}\n*{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Pfeiffer, Ida Laura Reyer}}\n*{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Pfeiffer, Ida}}\n*{{cite book |last= Leidler |first= Keith |title= Female Caligula: Ranavalona, the Mad Queen of Madagascar |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-470-02223-X }}\n*Mary Somers Heidhues (2004) \u201cWoman on the Road: Ida Pfeiffer in the Indies,\u201d ''Archipel'' 68 pp.&nbsp;289\u2013313 [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/arch_0044-8613_2004_num_68_1_3839 Online here]\n*Baker, D.

Rijnhart had worked in the [[Netherlands]] for the [[Salvation Army]] but was sent to Canada in 1886 to avoid charges of sexual assault.

The couple was married in September 1894 and before the end of the year departed Canada for China.  Unlike most missionaries, they were independent, not representatives of any missionary organization. Apparently, however, the funds they had raised in Canada were adequate for their expenses. Independent missionaries were often criticized as loose cannons, more likely to cause trouble than to achieve progress in the goal of making China a Christian country.<ref name=DCB>{{cite DCB |title=Carson, Susanna |first=Alvyn J. |last=Austin |volume=13 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/carson_susanna_13E.html}}</ref>\n\n==On the borders of Tibet==\n[[File:Susie Rijnhart.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Dr. Susie Rijnhart in Tibetan dress.]]\n\nIn mid-1895, the Rijnharts and their colleague, William Neil Ferguson, arrived at their destination of Lusar, a small village servicing the [[Kumbum Monastery|Kumbum]], one of the largest and most important Tibetan Buddhist monasteries.

Susie and her husband were invited by the monastery to tend to the wounded and sick and subsequently invited to reside at the monastery. Petreus became a friend and confidant of the abbot of the monastery, according to Susie.\n\nIn late-summer 1896, for unclear reasons, the Rijnharts moved to the trading town of Tankar, about 24 miles from Kumbum, to open a medical dispensary.<ref>{{harvp|Rijnhart|1901|pp=138-139}}</ref> The British traveler, Montagu Sinclair Wellby, passed through Tankar in October 1896 and gave a favorable view of the Rijnharts and their good relations with Chinese officials.

Their destination was [[Lhasa]], eight hundred miles away as the crow flies but across a series of mountain ranges through passes at elevations of up to {{convert|5,000|m|ft}}. They carried with them food and other supplies sufficient for two years as well as several hundred bibles translated into Tibetan. Following a known caravan route to Lhasa, they skirted the [[Qaidam Basin|Tsaidam]] and proceeded southwest, roughly following the track a modern highway follows today.\n\nAll went well for more than two months until their two Chinese hired men deserted.  Shortly thereafter, on August 11, five of their pack animals were stolen. On August 21,  the baby Charles died suddenly.  They were at this time just north of the district capital of [[Nagchu Town|Nagchu]], {{convert|14,850|ft|m}} in elevation. As they continued Tibetan soldiers tried to persuade them to abandon their quest and return the way they had come. A Tibetan official in Nagchu refused to allow them to continue to Lhasa, only 100 miles further south, or to remain in Nagchu, but insisted they leave Tibet via a caravan route leading to [[Kangding]] (Tachienlu), 600 miles to the east. Their reliable Muslim guide departed at this time, with their permission, to journey to his home in [[Ladakh]] and they were left alone at the mercy of the Tibetans.  \n[[File:Petrus Rijnhart.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Petrus Rijnhart, 1866-1898.]]\nOn September 6, in a snow storm, with three guides provided by the Tibetan government, the Rijnharts departed Nagchu on the \"tea road\" east. On September 17 their little caravan was attacked by bandits. One of their guides was wounded and all their horses except three were stolen. Their guides deserted and they were left alone. They abandoned most of their goods and continued. On September 26, Petrus left Susie behind to seek help from Tibetans camped on the other side of a river. She never saw her husband again. She was left with a revolver and a supply of silver bullion, the currency of the area.   \n \nSusie engaged guides to accompany her on the road, but they proved faithless. She threatened them with the revolver to prevent being raped and robbed. She finally arrived at [[Gyegu]]  (Jyekundo), rested a few days, and there negotiated a passport from the Abbot of a monastery. She then proceeded onwards, crossing a series of mountain ranges, partially on foot and alone, but mostly with an escort of local guides. She arrived in Kangding penniless, in rags, and with frost-bitten feet on November 26, 1898. Kangding at that time was the most remote outpost of Christian missionaries in China. She asked the way to the house of the China Inland Mission and there she introduced herself to missionaries Edward Amundsen and James Moyes, who would later become her second husband.<ref>{{harvp|Rijnhart|1901|pp=191-397}}, is the sole source of information about the Rijnhart's journey.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nInvestigations by the British and Dutch government uncovered no information concerning the fate of Petrus Rijnhart and in 1900 Susie returned to Canada. She wrote a book about her experiences and lectured and in 1902 returned to China, this time to Kangding with the [[Foreign Christian Missionary Society]]. In 1905 she married James Moyes. Because of her former husband\u2019s dismissal from the CIM, Moyes had to resign from the CIM to marry her. Her health failed and in 1907 she and her husband returned to Canada. She had a baby, a son, in January 1908 and died on February 7, 1908 in Chatham.<ref name=Baker/> James Moyes returned to China in 1911 and in 1915 was working for the American Bible Society in [[Nanking]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Annual Report of American Bible Society |date=1912 |volume=Volume 96 |p=358 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Annual Report of American Bible Society |date=1915 |volume=Volume 99 |p=378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IM6AQAAMAAJ&pg=378}}</ref>\n\n==Importance==\nDr. Susie Rijnhart typified the independent and adventurous women, often missionaries, who were beginning to travel the world and practice a variety of professions. Her attempt to reach Lhasa seems to have been as much an adventure gone wrong as it was a Christian pilgrimage. Her book makes no mention of any converts to Christianity the couple made during their four years in China and Tibet.

Later, he became a world-renowned scientist and orientalist. Their younger son, Svetoslav, was born in October 1904. He became a [[Painting|painter]], thinker, and public worker. Roerich paid great attention to the children\u2019s upbringing. She read them the books, and taught them foreign languages and music. Together, they visited concerts, exhibitions, and theatre. She helped each of their sons to discover their own interests and dispositions, and created favorable conditions for their development.<ref>S. Kluchnikov. Proclaimer of the fire epoch.

In 1903\u20141904, they traveled together through forty old Russian cities to find sources of national history and culture. During these travels, Roerich had taken expert photographs of churches, architecture monuments, paintings, and ornaments. She also mastered the art of restoration and, together with Nicholas Konstantinovich, recovered some the masterpieces of great artists such as Rubens, Breugel, Vandyke, and van Orley, that had been hidden by latest paint layers. She also displayed her artistic intuition by collecting works of art and antiquities. Roerichs collected a beautiful family collection, composed of more than 300 works, which they later had transferred to the Hermitage Museum. Roerich also knew archeology well. Together with her husband, she often left for excavations in the regions of Novgorod\u2019s and Tver\u2019s, and took part in the work.<ref>S. Kluchnikov. Proclaimer of the fire epoch.

Roerich.</ref> In 1916, because of a serious lung disease, following the doctor\u2019s insistence, the Roerich family moved to Finland (Serdobol), to the seashore of [[Lake Ladoga]]. In 1918, Finland declared its independence and closed the Russian border. In 1919, the family moved to England, and made their home in London.\n\nHere, in 1920, Roerich, in collaboration with a group of anonymous thinkers and philosophers of the East, which in accordance with Indian\u2019s spiritual tradition were named \"The Great Teachers\" (Mahatmas), began to work for the [[Living Ethics]] Teaching (Agni Yoga). This was a new philosophical system relating to spiritual and cultural evolution of mankind.<ref name=\"s2\" />\n\n===Travels===\nIn 1920, N. K. Roerich received an invitation to tour the United States with an exhibition of his paintings. Thus, Roerich\u2019s family moved to New York City. Here, the cultural activity was organized under N. Roerich\u2019s leadership in partnership with Roerich. The culmination of this was the foundation in America of such cultural organizations as the Nicholas Roerich Museum, the Master-Institute of United Arts, the International painter\u2019s association \"Cor Ardens\" (Flaming Hearts), and the International Art Centre \"Corona Mundi\" (\"Crown of the World\"). All of these cultural centers organized by the Roerichs had a great influence on cultural development. Working throughout the world under the leadership of Roerich\u2019s cultural centers, numerous societies, creative clubs, and educational institutes united people in the name of culture activity.\n\nOn December 1923, Roerich, along with her family, moved to India. This country had always been of great interest to the Roerichs. Adoration of India and its spiritual culture was not unusual among Russian intellectuals of the time. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of 20th century, Russian culture had experienced an irrepressible attraction to this country, feeling that their moral searches coincided with Indian spiritual tradition.<ref>14 L.V.

K. Roerich]], that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of India, China, Russia ([[Altai Republic|Altai]]), [[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]]. During the expedition, research in topics such as history, archeology, ethnography, history of philosophy, arts and religions, and geography was conducted. Previously unknown mountain peaks and passes were mapped, rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples.<ref>Museum named after N.K. Roerich.

Roerich\u2019s expedition stayed in Gulmarg, Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from \"Mahatma\u2019s Letters\" from English to Russian, which she published in London in 1923. She also wrote a book named \"Chalice of the East\", which was published that year under the pen name \"Iskander Khanum\".<ref>18 Chalice of the East. Mahatmas Letters. Third edition. \u2014 Riga-Moscow-Minsk, \u00abLigatma-Moga-N\u00bb publishing, 1995.</ref>\n\nRoerich\u2019s manuscript \"Foundations of Buddhism\" was published in 1926, at Urga (now Ulan-Bator), where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha\u2019s Teaching were interpreted. The book also spoke about the deep moral basis of this Teaching and disproved one of the main stereotypes Western thinking of the time, namely, that the men of Buddhism are insignificant and forgotten by the Lord creature.<ref name=\"s6\" />\n\nIn 1927, one of the Living Ethics books (\"Community\") was published in the same place in Mongolia. After finishing of Central-Asian expedition, Roerichs remained in India, in Kullu valley [[Himachal Pradesh]]. There, in 1928, they had found an Institute of Himalayan Studies \"Urusvati\" (this means \"Light of Morning Star\" in Sanskrit). It was planned as institute for complex study of Asian regions which exerted influence on the development of world culture. Among the tasks of the \"Urusvati\" was the complex study of human, its psychic and physiological features. Roerich became an Honorary President-Founder of the institute and actively took part in organization of its work.<ref>Museum named after N.K. Roerich.

Later \"Urusvati\" became a large international institute that united well-known scientists from many countries. J. Bose, R. Tagore, A. Einstein, R. Millikan, L. de Broglie, R. Magoffin, S.

In 1929, her work \"Cryptograms of the East\" (\"On Eastern Crossroads\") was published in Paris in Russian under the pen name Josephine Saint-Hilaire. This work contains apocryphal legends and parables from the lives of great devotees and teachers of mankind: Buddha, Christ, Apollonius of Tiana, Akbar the Great, St. Sergius of Radonezh. Roerich devoted a special essay \"The Banner of St. Sergius of Radonezh\" to an image of the Savior and Defender of Russian land. In this essay she joined knowledge of history and theology with deep and reverent love to the hermit.<ref name=\"s6\" /> is essay was included in the book \"Banner of St. Sergius of Radonezh\", published under the pen name N. Yarovskaya in 1934.\n\n===Later life===\nIn the first half of the 1930s, Roerich translated from English to Russian two volumes of H.P. Blavatsky\u2019s fundamental work \"Secret Doctrine\". Separate fragments of this treatise were given in various often ancient languages. Roerich\u2019s proficiency in many languages and knowledge of philosophy made it possible to manage this work during a very short time (less than two years).<ref>S. Kluchnikov.

She corresponded with more than 140 persons. The letters geography involves several continents. Among Roerich\u2019s correspondents were friends, followers, cultural workers, political figures. In her letters, Roerich has answered numerous questions, explained the most complex philosophical and scientific problems, foundations of the Living Ethics. She wrote about great Laws of Cosmos, meaning of human life, importance of culture for human evolution, Great Teachers.<ref name=\"s11\" />\n\nIn 1940, a two-volume edition of \"Letters of Helena Roerich\" was published in Riga. A complete set of Roerich\u2019s letters is published by the International Centre of the Roerichs, where her epistolary heritage is kept. It was transferred to ICR by S.N. Roerich in 1990.\n\nDuring N.K. Roerich\u2019s Manchurian expedition, Roerich had corresponded with international cultural and enlightens organizations and coordinated its activity for support the Roerich\u2019s Pact (International agreement for protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments). As a result of this work, the Roerich\u2019s Pact was signed on April 15, 1935 by heads of 22 countries.<ref name=\"s11\" />\n\nIn January 1948, after her husband\u2019s death, Roerich, together with her elder son moved to Delhi and then to Khandala (Bombay\u2019s suburb), where they had waited for steamship from Russia with their entrance visas. But Russia denied their visas. They made their home in Kalimpong. Roerich continued hope for return home and to transfer to Russian people the works of her life, to work for good of \"Best Country\" (she called Russia by this name). Roerich just like N.K. Roerich had not changed Russian citizenship. But her numerous applications remained without response.\n\n===Death===\nRoerich died October 5, 1955. In the place of her cremation the lamas had raised a white stupa on which the following epitaph was carved: \"Helena Roerich, the wife of Nicholas Roerich, thinker and writer, old friend of India\".<ref>Museum named after N.K.

She was eventually married to [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]], [[Royal Governor of Chile]].\n\n==Early life==\nSu\u00e1rez was born in [[Plasencia]], [[Extremadura]], Spain in 1507.<ref name=Mari\u00f1o>{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica del Reino de Chile |last=Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |first=Pedro |authorlink=Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=VIII |quote=...una se\u00f1ora que iba con el general llamada do\u00f1a In\u00e9s Ju\u00e1rez, natural de Plasencia y casada en M\u00e1laga, mujer de mucha cristiandad y edificaci\u00f3n de nuestros soldados... |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/13582842323460728544424/p0000001.htm#I_13_}}</ref> She came to the [[Americas]] approximately in 1537, around the age of thirty. It is generally assumed that she was in search of her husband Juan de M\u00e1laga, who had left Spain to serve in the New World with the Pizarro brothers. After a long time of continuous searching in numerous [[South America]]n countries, she arrived in Lima in 1538.\n\nSu\u00e1rez's husband had died before she had reached [[Peru]] (she told a compatriot that he died at sea) and the next information that is known of her is in 1539, when she applied for and was granted, as the widow of a Spanish soldier, a small plot of land in [[Cusco|Cuzco]] and [[encomienda]] rights to a number of Indians.\n\nShortly afterward, Su\u00e1rez became the mistress of [[Pedro de Valdivia]], the conqueror of [[Chile]]. The earliest mention of her friendship with Valdivia was after he returned from the [[Battle of Las Salinas]] (1538). Although they were from the same area of Spain and at least one novelist relates a tale of long-standing love between them, there is no real evidence that they had met prior to her arrival in Cuzco.\n\n==Conquest of Chile==\n[[Image:Saintjamesconquistador.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Saint James the Moor-slayer]], [[Cuzco school]] (17th century)]]\nIn late 1539, over the objections of Francisco Mart\u00ednez and encouraged by some of his captains, Valdivia, using the intermediary services of a [[Mercedarian]] priest, requested official permission for Su\u00e1rez to become a part of the group of 12 Spaniards he was leading to the South. [[Francisco Pizarro]], in his letter to Valdivia (January of 1540) granting permission for Su\u00e1rez to accompany Valdivia as his domestic servant, addressed the following words to Su\u00e1rez, \"...as Valdivia tells me, the men are afraid to go on such a long trip and you very courageously put yourself in the face of that danger...\"\n\nDuring the long and harrowing trip to the south, Su\u00e1rez, in addition to caring for Valdivia and treating the sick and wounded, found water for them in the desert, and saved Valdivia when one of his rivals tried to undermine his enterprise and take his life. The natives, having already experienced the incursions of the Spaniards, ([[Diego de Almagro]], 1535\u20131536) [[scorched earth|burned their crops]] and drove off their livestock, leaving nothing for Valdivia\u2019s band and the animals which accompanied them.\n\nIn December of 1540, eleven months after they left Cuzco, Valdivia and his band reached the valley of the [[Mapocho]] river, where Valdivia was to establish the capital of the territory. The valley was extensive and well populated with natives. Its soil was fertile and there was abundant fresh water. Two high hills provided defensive positions. Soon after their arrival, Valdivia tried to convince the natives of his good intentions, sending  delegations bearing gifts for the [[cacique]]s.\n\nThe natives kept the gifts but, united under the leadership of [[Michimalonco]], attacked the Spaniards and were at the point of overwhelming them. Suddenly, the natives threw down their weapons and fled. Captured Indians declared that they had seen a man, mounted on a white horse and carrying a naked sword, descend from the clouds and attack them. The Spaniards decided it was a miraculous appearance of ''Santo Iago'' ([[Saint James the Greater]] who had already been seen during the [[Reconquista]] at the  [[battle of Clavijo]]) and, in thanks, named the new city Santiago del Nuevo Extremo. The city was officially dedicated on February 12, 1541.\n\n===First destruction of Santiago===\n[[Image:InesSuarez.png|thumb|300px|left|In\u00e9s de Su\u00e1rez [[beheading]] the [[hostage]]s]]\nIn August 1541, when Valdivia was occupied on the coast, Su\u00e1rez uncovered another plot to unseat him. After the plotters were taken care of, Valdivia turned his attention to the Indians and he invited seven caciques to meet with him to arrange for the delivery of food. When the Indians arrived, Valdivia had them held as hostages for the safe delivery of the provisions and the safety of outlying settlements. On the September 9, Valdivia took forty men and left the city to put down an uprising of Indians near Aconcagua.\n\nEarly on the morning of September 10, 1541, a young ''[[yanakuna]]'' brought word to Captain [[Alonso de Monroy]], who had been left in charge of the city, that the woods around the city were full of natives. Su\u00e1rez was asked if she thought that the Indian hostages should be released as a peace gesture. She replied that she saw it as a bad idea; if the Indians overpowered the Spaniards, the hostages would provide their only bargaining power. Monroy accepted her counsel and issued a call for a council of war.\n\nJust before dawn on September 11, mounted Spaniards rode out to engage the Indians, whose numbers were estimated first at 8,000 and later at 20,000, and who were led by [[Michimalonco]]. In spite of the advantage of their horses and their skill with their swords, by noon the Spaniards were pushed into a retreat toward the east, across the [[Mapocho River]]; and, by mid-afternoon, they were backed up to the plaza itself.\n\nAll day the battle raged. Fire arrows and torches set fire to most of the city; four Spaniards were killed along with a score of horses and other animals. The situation became desperate. The priest, [[Rodrigo Gonz\u00e1lez Marmolejo]], said later that the fight was like the Day of Judgment for the Spaniards and that only a miracle saved them.\n\nAll day Su\u00e1rez had been carrying food and water to the fighting men, nursing the wounded, giving them encouragement and comfort. The historian [[Mari\u00f1o de Lobera]] wrote of her activities during the battle: {{blockquote|...and she went among them, she told them that if they felt fatigued and if they were wounded she would cure them with her own hands... she went where they were, even among the hooves of the horses; and she did not just cure them, she animated them and raised their morale, sending them back into the battle renewed... one [[Knight|caballero]] whose wounds she had just treated, was so tired and weak from loss of blood that he could not mount his horse. This woman was so moved by his plea for help that she put herself into the midst of the fray and helped him to mount his horse...<ref name=Mari\u00f1o>{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica del Reino de Chile |last=Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |first=Pedro |authorlink=Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=XLIII |quote= |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/13582842323460728544424/p0000002.htm#I_49_}}</ref>}}\n\nSu\u00e1rez recognized the discouragement of the men and the extreme danger of the situation; she offered a suggestion. All day the seven caciques who were prisoners of the Spaniards, had been shouting encouragement to their people. Su\u00e1rez proposed that Spaniards decapitate the seven and toss their heads out among the Indians in order to frighten them. There was some objection to the plan, since several men felt that the fall of the city was imminent and that the captive caciques would be their only bargaining advantage with the Indians. Su\u00e1rez insisted that hers was the only viable solution to their problem. She then went to the house where the chieftains were guarded by Francisco Rubio and Hernando de la Torre and gave the order for the execution. Mari\u00f1o de Lobera tells that the guard, La Torre, asked, \"In what manner shall we kill them, my lady?\" \"In this manner,\" she replied, and, seizing la Torre\u2019s sword, she herself cut off the heads.<ref name=Mari\u00f1o>{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica del Reino de Chile |last=Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |first=Pedro |authorlink=Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=XV |quote=...Mas como empezase a salir la aurora y anduviese la batalla muy sangrienta, comenzaron tambi\u00e9n los siete caciques que estaban presos a dar voces a los suyos para que los socorriesen libert\u00e1ndoles de la prisi\u00f3n en que estaban.

According to an eyewitness, \"...she went out to the plaza and put herself in front of all the soldiers, encouraging them with words of such exaggerated praise that they treated her as if she were a brave captain,...instead of a woman masquerading as a soldier in iron mail.\"<ref name=Mari\u00f1o>{{cite book |title=Cr\u00f3nica del Reino de Chile |last=Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |first=Pedro |authorlink=Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapter=XV |quote=Viendo do\u00f1a In\u00e9s Ju\u00e1rez que el negocio iba de rota batida y se iba declarando la victoria por los indios, ech\u00f3 sobre sus hombros una cota de malla y se puso juntamente una cuera de anta y desta manera sali\u00f3 a la plaza y se puso delante de todos los soldados anim\u00e1ndolos con palabras de tanta ponderaci\u00f3n, que eran m\u00e1s de un valeroso capit\u00e1n hecho a las armas que de una mujer ejercitada en su almohadilla.|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/13582842323460728544424/p0000001.htm#I_20_}}</ref>\n\nThe Spaniards took advantage of the confusion and disorder engendered among the Indians by the gory heads, and spurred on by the courageous woman who now led them, succeeded in driving the now disordered Indians from the town. One historian wrote, \"The Indians said afterward that the Christians would have been defeated were it not for a woman on a white horse.\"\n\nIn 1545, in recognition of her courage and valor, Valdivia rewarded Su\u00e1rez with an [[encomienda]]. His testament of dedication said in part: {{blockquote|...in battle with the enemies who did not take into account the caciques who were our prisoners, they that were in the most central place - to which the Indians came, ...throwing themselves on you, and you, seeing how weakened your beleaguered forces were then, you made them kill the caciques who were prisoners, putting your own hands on them, causing the majority of the Indians to run away and they left off fighting when they witnessed the evidence of the death of their chieftains; ...it is certain that if they had not been killed and thrown among their countrymen, there would not be a single Spaniard remaining alive in all this city... by taking up the sword and letting if fall on the necks of the cacique prisoners, you have saved all of us.}}\n\nAlthough there is a great deal of consistency in the accounts, given the passage of time and the tendency of the Spaniards to embroider their reports a bit, it is likely that there is at least some exaggeration in the telling. The truth of the matter is that it is certain that Su\u00e1rez played a crucial role in the salvation of Santiago in 1541. Had it not been for her bravery, the city would have certainly fallen and the Spaniards most likely would have been slaughtered by the Indians, ending, at least for a time, the southward colonial expansion.\n\n==Later life==\n\nSu\u00e1rez continued to live openly with [[Pedro de Valdivia]], until the time of his trial in Lima. One of the charges levelled against him was that he, being married, openly lived with her \"...in the manner of man and wife\". In exchange for being freed, and his confirmation as Royal Governor, he was forced to relinquish her and to bring to Chile his wife, [[Marina Ort\u00edz de Gaete]], who only arrived after Valdivia's death in 1554. He was also ordered to marry Su\u00e1rez off.\n\nSu\u00e1rez was married in 1549 to Valdivia's captain, [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]], when she was 42 and the groom was 38. After her marriage, she led a very quiet life, dedicated to her home and to charity. She was held in great esteem in Chile, as being a valiant woman and a great captain. Eventually, after the death of Valdivia, her husband twice became Royal Governor himself, in 1565 and 1575. They both died in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]], within months of each other, in 1580.\n\n==Su\u00e1rez in historical fiction==\n\nSu\u00e1rez is the main character in several historical novels, such as ''\"In\u00e9s y las ra\u00edces de la tierra\"'', (\"In\u00e9s and the roots of the land\"), by [[Mar\u00eda Correa Morande]] (ZigZag, 1964),  ''\"Ay Mam\u00e1 In\u00e9s - Cr\u00f3nica Testimonial\"'' (\"Woe, Momma In\u00e9s - Testimonial Chronicle\") (Andres Bello, 1993) by [[Jorge Guzm\u00e1n]], and ''\"[[In\u00e9s of My Soul]]\"'' ({{lang-es|In\u00e9s del alma m\u00eda}}) by [[Isabel Allende]] (HarperCollins, 2006). In her author's note Allende wrote: \"This novel is a work of intuition, but any similarity to events and persons relating to the conquest of Chile is not coincidental\".\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]]\n*[[Jer\u00f3nimo de Alderete]]\n*[[Mapuche|Mapuche people]]\n*[[Rodrigo de Quiroga]]\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Pedro de Valdivia]]\n*[[Francisco de Villagra]]\n*[[Arauco War]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{EB1911}}\n*{{cite book |last=Amun\u00e1tegui |first=Miguel Luis |authorlink=Miguel Luis Amun\u00e1tegui |editor= |others= |title=Descubrimiento i conquista de Chile |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0008747.pdf |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=1913 |publisher=Imprenta, Litograf\u00eda i Encuadernaci\u00f3n Barcelona |location=Santiago, Chile |language=Spanish |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=181\u2013346 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate=  |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}\n*{{cite book |last=Barros Arana |first=Diego |authorlink=Diego Barros Arana |editor= |others= |title=Proceso de Pedro de Valdivia i Otros Documentos In\u00e9ditos Concernientes a Este Conquistador |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0000482.pdf |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year=1873 |publisher=Librer\u00eda Central de Augusto Raymond |location=Santiago, Chile |language=Spanish |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=392 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate=  |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}\n*{{cite book |last=Ercilla |first=Alonso de |authorlink=Alonso de Ercilla |editor= |others=Eswikisource |title=La Araucana |url=http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Araucana |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |publisher= |location= |language=Spanish |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate=  |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}\n*{{cite book |last=G\u00f3ngora Marmolejo |first=Alonso de |authorlink=Alonso de G\u00f3ngora Marmolejo |editor= |others= |title=Historia de Todas las Cosas que han Acaecido en el Reino de Chile y de los que lo han gobernado (1536-1575) |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/FichaObra.html?Ref=1102&portal=157 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series=Cr\u00f3nicas del Reino de Chile |volume= |origyear= |year=1960 |publisher=Atlas |location=Madrid, Spain |language=Spanish |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=75\u2013224 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate=  |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}\n*{{cite book |last=Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |first=Pedro |authorlink=Pedro Mari\u00f1o de Lobera |editor=Fr.

While there she converted to Christianity a young Tibetan named Pontso, about 19 years old, who was to accompany her on her expedition to Tibet. In March 1891, she left Sikkim with Pontso and traveled to China, making her way to [[Tianshui]] where she founded a mission.

They arrived in [[Gyegu]] (Jyekundo), the center of the tea trade between China and Tibet on 11 November, but bypassed the town, fearing they would be apprehended by the authorities.  From Gyegu they followed a well-known caravan trail toward Lhasa. \n\nBy this time, the little caravan was riven with dissention with Taylor fearing that Noga, her hired Chinese Muslim guide, might betray or even murder her.<ref>Carey, pp. 219-222</ref>  The transcriber of Taylor's diary, who knew Taylor well, suggests that Noga did not consider himself a servant, but rather an equal and that the dissention might have been due to misunderstanding about their servant/master relationship.  To Taylor's relief, Noga departed on 14 December.<ref>Carey, p. 139, 236</ref> \n\nOn 3 January 1893, cold, most of their horses dead or stolen and without food\u2014but only three days march from Lhasa\u2014Taylor, Pontsu, and another servant were apprehended by Tibetan authorities beyond [[Nagchu Town|Nagchu]].<ref>Taylor, Annie R. \"My Experiences in Tibet.\" ''The Scottish Geographical Magazine'' Vol X, Jan 1894, p. 6</ref>  After several days of difficult negotiations, Taylor was told that she must return to China by the shortest route.

The soldiers soon left them in the company of merchants and she traveled onward in bitter cold, reaching Gyegu on 21 February.  From Gyegu, she arranged to continue her journey with Chinese merchants via the tea road to [[Kangding]] (Tachienlu), paying Tibetans to carry their few remaining goods. On 12 April 1893 she and Pontso, her only remaining companion, arrived in Kangding.  French missionaries there assisted her and two days later she departed to the coast of China and to return to England.<ref>Carey, 278-285</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nTaylor became a minor celebrity in England.  She formed an organization called the \"Tibetan Pioneer Mission\" and recruited 14 people to travel with her to Sikkim to study Tibetan and evangelize on the borders of Tibet. Within a year \"the infant mission was in a shambles.

She often went by the first name Alexine.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nAlexandrine was the daughter of Philip Frederik Tinne and Baroness Henriette van Capellen. Philip Tinne was a Dutch merchant who settled in England during the Napoleonic wars and later returned to his native land. Henriette van Capellen, daughter of a famous Dutch Vice-Admiral, [[Theodorus Frederik van Capellen]], was Philip's second wife, and Alexandrine was born when he was sixty-three. \nYoung Alexandrine was tutored at home, and showed a proficiency at piano. Her wealthy father died when she was ten years old, leaving her the richest woman in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Johnston2011\">{{cite book|author=Harry Johnston|title=The Nile Quest: A Record of the Exploration of the Nile and Its Basin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwyNRM591DMC&pg=PA192|date=17 November 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-03300-8|pages=192\u2013194}}</ref>\n\n==Travels in North Eastern and Central Africa==\n\nFor the first extensive journey in Central Africa Alexine Tinne left Europe in the summer of 1861 for the White Nile regions. Accompanied by her mother and her aunt, she set out on 9 January 1862. After a short stay at [[Khartoum]] the party ascended the [[White Nile]] to Gondokoro, the first European women to arrive there. Alexandrine fell ill and they were forced to return reaching Khartoum on 20 November. Directly after their return [[Theodor von Heuglin]] and [[Hermann Steudner]] met with the Tinne's and the four of them planned to travel to the [[Bahr el Ghazal (river)|Bahr-el-Ghazal]], a tributary of the White Nile, in order to reach the countries of the 'Niam-Niam'(Azande). Heuglin and Steudner left Khartoum on 25 January, ahead of the expedition. The Tinnes followed on 5 February. Heuglin also had a geographical exploration in mind, intending to explore the uncharted region beyond the river and to ascertain how far westward the Nile basin extended; also to investigate the reports of a vast lake in [[Central Africa]] eastwards of those already known, most likely the lake-like expanses of the [[middle Congo]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:\u0422\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0435 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|170 px|Alexandrine Tinn\u00e9 into Africa]]\nAscending the Bahr-el-Ghazal, the limit of navigation was reached on 10 March. From [[Meshra-er-Rek]] a journey was made overland, across the [[Jur River|Bahr Jur]] and south-west by the [[Bahr Kosango]], to [[Jebel Kosango]], on the borders of the [[Zande people|Niam-Niam]] country. During the journey all the travelers suffered severely from fever. Steudner died in April and Alexandrine's mother in July, followed by two Dutch maids. After many fatigues and dangers the remainder of the party reached Khartoum at the end of March 1864, when Miss Tinne's aunt, who had stayed in Khartoum, died. Alexine Tinne buried her aunt and one maid, and brought the corpse of her mother and the other maid back to Cairo. John Tinne, her half-brother from Liverpool, visited Alexine in January/February 1865, with the intention of talking her into joining him back home. Alexine was not to be persuaded, and John left with the two corpses and a large part of her ethnographic collection. Her mother's corpse later was buried at the Oud Eik en Duinen cemetery in The Hague. Alexine's ethnographic collection was donated by John to the Public Museum (now the Liverpool World Museum).\n\nThe geographical and scientific results of the expedition were highly important, as will be seen in Heuglin's ''Die Tinn\u00e9sche Expedition im westlichen Nilgebiet'' (1863&ndash;1864 (Gotha, 1865), and ''Reise in das Gebiet des Weissen Nils'' Leipzig, 1869). A description, by T Kotschy and J Peyritsch, of some of the plants discovered by the expedition was published at Vienna in 1867 under the title of Plantae Tinneanae, and introduced 24 new species to science, including 19 species in the mint family.\n\nAt Cairo Miss Tinne lived in Oriental style during the next four years, visiting [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and other parts of the Mediterranean.\nAn attempt to reach the Touaregs in 1868 from Algiers failed.\n\n==Saharan expedition and death==\nIn January 1869 she again made an attempt to reach the Touaregs. She started from [[Tripoli]] with a caravan, intending to proceed to [[Lake Chad]], and thence by [[Ouaddai Kingdom|Wadai]], [[Darfur]] and [[Kordofan]] to the upper Nile. In Murzuq she met the German explorer [[Gustav Nachtigal]], with whom she intended to cross the desert. As Nachtigal wanted to go to the [[Tibesti]] Mountains first, she set out for the South on her own. Her caravan advanced slowly. Due to her diseases (attacks of gout, inflammation of her eyes) she was not able to maintain order in her group.\n\nIn the early morning of 1 August on the route from [[Murzuk]] to [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]] she was murdered together with two Dutch sailors in her party, allegedly by [[Tuareg|Tuareg people]] in league with her escort. According to the statements at the trial in Tripoli in December 1869/January 1870, two blows of a sword (one in her neck, one on one of her hands) made her collapse. They left her to bleed to death. Her body was never found.\n\nThere are several theories as to the motive, none of them proven. One is that her guides believed that her iron water tanks were filled with gold. It is also possible that her death came as a result of an internal political conflict between local Tuareg chiefs. Another explorer, Erwin von Bary, who visited the same area in the 1870s, met participants of the assault and learned that it had been a blow against the \"great old man\" of the Northern Tuaregs, Ikhenukhen, who was to be removed from his powerful position, and the means was to be the killing of the Christians\u2014just to prove that Ikhenukhen was too weak to protect travelers. Given the internal strife among the Northern Tuareg that lasted until the Ottoman occupation of the Fezzan Province (Southern Libya) this version is the most probable explanation of the otherwise unmotivated massacre.\n\nIt was believed her collections of ethnographic specimens in the museum at Liverpool, England were destroyed in 1941 during a bombing raid. The church built in her memory in The Hague was similarly destroyed. Recent research revealed however that around 75% (over 100 objects) of her ethnographic collection survived the air raid. Besides their value as an irreplaceable document of her two Sudan journeys in 1862-1864, her collection, together with the contemporary one of Heuglin at Stuttgart (the Linden Museum), represent rare specimens of an early date belonging to material cultures in the Sudan. \nA small marker near Juba in Sudan commemorating the great Nile explorers of the 19th century bears her name, as well as a window plaque in Tangiers. Many of her remaining papers, including most of her letters from Africa, are stored at the National Archive in The Hague. Her photographs are at the National Archive and the Haags Gemeentearchief (Municipal Archive of The Hague).\n\nAlternate spellings: Alexine Tinne, Alexandrine Tinn\u00e9.\n\n==Images==\n<gallery>\nImage:Alexandrine Tinne, by Henri Auguste d'Ainecy Montpezat.jpg|Alexine Tinne by Henri d'Ainecy Montpezat (1849).

Walker began her climbing rather modestly in 1858 when she was advised by her doctor to take up walking as a cure for rheumatism.  Accompanied by her father Frank Walker and her brother [[Horace Walker]], both of whom were early members of the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]], and Oberland guide [[Melchior Anderegg]], she became the first woman to regularly climb in the [[Alps]].\n\nWalker's achievements were, at first, largely unnoticed except by those in her immediate company.  Early successes included the first ascent of the [[Balmhorn]] (1864), and the first female ascent of the [[Eiger]] (1864),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Claire Jane|title=Lady-like Victorian psyche: the story of Lucy Walker and the Eiger|url=https://www.thebmc.co.uk/ladylike-victorian-psyche-the-story-of-lucy-walker-and-the-eiger|publisher=BMC}}</ref> [[Wetterhorn]] (1866), [[Lyskamm]] (1868) and [[Piz Bernina]] (1869). In 1871 she learned that her rival [[Meta Brevoort]], an American female mountaineer, was planning an expedition to climb the Matterhorn.  Walker hastily assembled a group and on 22 August, while wearing a white print dress, she became the first woman to stand atop the Matterhorn, and with it gained world renown. Also in that year she completed her fourth ascent of the [[Eiger]] during which she is said to have lived on a diet of [[sponge cake]], [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] and [[Asti Spumante]].\n\nIn all Lucy Walker completed a total of 98 expeditions. In 1909 she became a member of the newly formed [[Ladies' Alpine Club]] where she was acclaimed as the pioneer of women climbers.  In 1913 she was elected its second President and served in that capacity until 1915. She died at her home in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], on 10 September 1916.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*[[Janet Adam Smith]], ''Walker, Lucy (1836\u20131916)'', [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52561 [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2004\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walker, Lucy (climber)}}\n[[Category:1836 births]]\n[[Category:1916 deaths]]\n[[Category:English explorers]]\n[[Category:Women of the Victorian era]]\n[[Category:English mountain climbers]]\n[[Category:Female explorers]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Ladies' Alpine Club]]\n[[Category:Female climbers]]\n[[Category:People associated with the Matterhorn]]\n[[Category:People associated with the Eiger]]"}]},"37256255":{"pageid":37256255,"ns":0,"title":"Aloha Wanderwell"},"24733687":{"pageid":24733687,"ns":0,"title":"Jessica Watson","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Use Australian English|date=August 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox person\n|name=Jessica Watson\n|image=Jessica Watson Ddf 2011.jpg\n|alt=\n|caption=Watson in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Germany]], in 2011\n|birth_name=\n|birth_date={{birth date and age|1993|5|18|df=yes}}\n|birth_place=[[Gold Coast, Queensland]], [[Australia]]\n|residence=[[Buderim]], Queensland\n|other_names=\n|known_for=Youngest person to complete solo southern hemisphere [[circumnavigation]]\n|occupation=Sailor\n|religion=\n|nationality=Australian<br>New Zealander\n|parents=Julie Watson<br>Roger Watson\n|website=[http://www.jessicawatson.com.au/ Official website]\n}}\n'''Jessica Watson''', [[Medal of the Order of Australia|OAM]] (born 18 May 1993) is an Australian sailor who completed a [[southern hemisphere]] solo [[circumnavigation]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jessicawatson.com.au/news/the-facts-about-jessica-s-voyage|title=The facts about Jessica's Voyage|date=5 May 2010|accessdate=28 Feb 2015}}</ref> at the age of 16. \nDeparting [[Sydney]] on 18 October 2009, Watson headed north-east crossing the [[equator]] in the Pacific Ocean before crossing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

The two married on 8 June 1869. From the late 1870s, Wilfrid and Lady Anne travelled extensively in [[Arabia]] and the Middle East, buying [[Arabian horse]]s from [[Bedouin]] tribesmen and the Egyptian [[Ali Pasha Sherif]]. Among the great and influential horses they took to England were Azrek, Dajania, Queen of Sheba, Rodania and the famous Ali Pasha Sherif stallion [[Mesaoud]]. To this day, the vast majority of purebred [[Arabian horse]]s trace their lineage to at least one Crabbet ancestor.\n\n==Life and work==\nLady Anne was a daughter of [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace]] and [[Ada Lovelace|Ada King, Countess of Lovelace]], the world's first [[computer programmer]]. Her maternal grandparents were the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Annabella Byron, 11th Baroness Wentworth]].

She also had a lifelong love of horses, dating from childhood, and was an accomplished [[equestrianism|equestrienne]].<ref name=\"Wentworth\">Wentworth, Judith Anne Dorothea Blunt-Lytton. ''The Authentic Arabian Horse, 3rd ed.''

Her many pregnancies produced a single surviving child, [[Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth]]. Anne never ceased to grieve over her miscarriages and the babies who died soon after birth. Although a fond father to Judith when she was a child, Blunt made no secret that he would have preferred a son. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nLady Anne and Wilfrid differed over management of their horses, with Wilfrid, though the less talented horseman, often prevailing on management decisions.  At times, this meant leaving valuable bloodstock in [[Egypt]] under the care of inept managers who neglected the horses to the point that some died of exposure and thirst. In England, his theory that Arabian horses should live under \"desert conditions\", even in a cold, damp climate, often meant the animals lived with insufficient [[fodder]] and exposed to an unnecessary degree to the elements.<ref name=\"Wentworth\"/>\n\nBlunt also had many mistresses, often simultaneously.  However, in 1906, when his mistress Dorothy Carleton (later adopted as his niece) moved into their home, Lady Anne, unable to tolerate what she termed an \"oriental\" lifestyle, left him.<ref name=\"Wentworth\"/> The Blunts agreed to a formal separation and the Stud was divided. Lady Anne signed a Deed of Partition drawn up by Wilfrid. Under its terms, Lady Anne kept Crabbet Park and half the horses, while Blunt took Caxtons Farm, also known as Newbuildings, and the rest of the stock. Following the separation, Lady Anne spent several months each year at her [[Sheykh Obeyd]] estate near [[Cairo]], a 32-acre (129,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) apricot orchard the Blunts had purchased in 1882 and set up as a breeding farm for the horses they owned in Egypt. Her daughter Judith lived full-time at the Crabbet estate with her own husband and children. Finally, leaving the stud under the management of Judith, Lady Anne left England permanently in October 1915 and spent the remaining years of her life at Sheykh Obeyd. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Legacy==\nShortly before her own death in 1917, Lady Anne inherited the [[Baron Wentworth|Wentworth]] title after her niece, [[Ada King-Milbanke, 14th Baroness Wentworth]] died childless. Wilfrid, always short of money, made a number of attempts to get Lady Anne to sign control or ownership of her portion of Crabbet to him, going so far at one point as to alienate Judith and her mother to the point that Lady Anne disinherited Judith (though she wisely chose not to favour Wilfred).<ref name=\"Wentworth\"/> Following Lady Anne's death in 1917, the Wentworth title passed to Judith, who by that time owned some horses and property in her own right, and Lady Anne bequeathed her remaining portion of Crabbet to Judith's daughters, appointing a trustee to oversee the estate. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nWilfrid and Judith disputed Lady Anne's estate and the ownership of many horses. The bitter battle went to court, where a verdict in favour of Judith's children was rendered in 1920, invalidating the deed of partition and reunifying most of the stud.<ref name=\"Wentworth\"/> Wilfrid died in 1922, having verbally reconciled with Judith but without rewriting his will to grant her any inheritance of his remaining property. Over time Judith had managed to buy out her daughters' shares of Crabbet and Newbuidings from the trustee, buy back many of the horses Wilfrid had sold to third parties, and the Crabbet stud continued under Judith's management. Under Judith, her management and breeding decisions improved upon the \"desert conditions\" theories of Wilfrid.<ref name=\"Wentworth\"/> Her addition of non-desertbred Arabian stock, such as the Polish-bred Arabian stallion [[Skowronek (horse)|Skowronek]], created controversy, but the stud survived and prospered for almost fifty years until 1971, when the property itself was bisected by a motorway. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Judith sold Crabbet horses all over the world, including to the United States, Australia, Spain and Russia. She sold some horses bred from the Blunt lines back to [[Egypt]], where they have a legacy today. Modern studs known for Crabbet breeding, including [[Bazy Tankersley|Al-Marah]] in America and [http://www.users.bigpond.com/FenwickStud/ Fenwick] in Australia, which both owe their existence to large-scale importations of horses bred at Crabbet.\n\nToday, due to the worldwide dispersal of Crabbet stock over its near-century of existence, most modern [[Arabian horse]]s contain lines to Crabbet breeding, regardless of their nation of birth. Over 90% of all Arabians registered in the United States, for example, contain one or more lines to the Crabbet Park Stud.<ref>[http://www.arabianhorses.org] Arabian Horse Association website]; accessed 27 March 2014.</ref> Some \"Crabbet\" breeders consider themselves preservationists, maintaining a small pool of pure or high-percentage Crabbet horses, while others use these lines as an outcross on other strains.

She was one of the first female professional mountaineers; she not only explored but also wrote about her adventures. She set several [[World altitude record (mountaineering)#Women's altitude record|women's altitude records]], published eight travel books with her husband, and championed women's rights and [[women's suffrage]].\n\nBorn to a wealthy family, Workman was educated in the finest schools available to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in [[New Hampshire]], Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a [[New Woman]] who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented on the state of the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.\n\nAt the end of their cycling trip through India, the couple escaped to the [[Western Himalaya]] and the [[Karakoram]] for the summer months, where they were introduced to [[high-altitude]] climbing. They returned to this then-unexplored region eight times over the next 14 years. Despite not having modern climbing equipment, the Workmans explored several glaciers and reached the summit of several mountains, eventually reaching {{convert|23,000|ft|m}} on [[Pinnacle Peak (Jammu and Kashmir)|Pinnacle Peak]], a women's altitude record at the time. They organized multiyear expeditions but struggled to remain on good terms with the local labor force. Coming from a position of American privilege and wealth, they failed to understand the position of the native workers and had difficulty finding and negotiating for reliable porters.\n\nAfter their trips to the Himalaya, the Workmans gave lectures about their travels. They were invited to learned societies; Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the [[Sorbonne]] and the second to speak at the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. She received many medals of honor from European climbing and geographical societies and was recognized as one of the foremost climbers of her day. She demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Mt. Washington 50.JPG|left|thumb|Fanny Workman learned her love of climbing on [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]].]]\nWorkman was born January 8, 1859, in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], to a wealthy and elite family descended from the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]]; she was the youngest of three children.

Bullock]], businessman and [[American Republican Party|Republican]] [[Massachusetts]] governor.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=33}}{{sfn|Kraig|1999}}{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=103}} Fanny was educated by [[governess]]es before attending Miss Graham's Finishing School in [[New York City]], after which she spent time in [[Paris]] and then [[Dresden]].{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=51}} Thomas Pauly writes in his short biography of Workman that  \"early on Fanny chafed at the constraints of her privilege\".{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=33}}  A small number of her stories from this time survive, describing her interest in adventure.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=33}} In one, \"A Vacation Episode\", she describes a beautiful and aristocratic English girl who is contemptuous of society. She runs away to [[Grindelwald]], becoming an excellent [[alpinist]] and marrying an American. The story encapsulates much of Fanny's own life: [[wanderlust]], a love of the mountains, and a commitment to [[women's rights]].{{sfn|Plint|1992\u20131993|p=231}}  In 1886, she published a short story, set during the [[King Philip's War|First Indian War]], in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' about \"the capture and rescue of a white girl\"; a reviewer of the story stated that it was \"told in a very pleasant and infatuating style\".<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=891817|title = New Publications|last = |first = |date = 5 June 1886|work = The Record-Union|accessdate = 22 August 2014|publication-place = Sacramento, California|page = 4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1879, Fanny returned to the United States and on June 16, 1882 married [[William Hunter Workman]], a man 12 years her senior. He was also from a wealthy and educated family, having attended [[Yale]] and having received his medical training at [[Harvard]].{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=34}}{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=360}} In 1884<ref name=\"leonard\" /> they had a daughter, [[Lady Rachel Workman MacRobert|Rachel]].\n\nWilliam introduced Fanny to climbing after their marriage,{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=51}} and together they spent many summers in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in [[New Hampshire]]; here she summited [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] ({{convert|6293|ft|m|disp=or}}) several times.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=103}}{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=39}} Climbing in the [[Northeastern United States]] allowed Fanny to develop her abilities together with other women. Unlike European clubs, American climbing clubs in the White Mountains allowed women to be members and encouraged women to climb. They promoted a new vision of the American woman, one who was both domestic and athletic, and Workman took to this image with enthusiasm. By 1886, women sometimes outnumbered men on hiking expeditions in [[New England]].<ref>''Appalachia, The Journal of the Appalachian Mountain Club''.  Vol 4, pages 161,163,223 & 255</ref> In her paper on the gender dynamics of climbing in the region, Jenny Ernie-Steighner states that this formative experience shaped Workman's commitment to women's rights, pointing out that \"no other well-known international mountaineers of the time, male or female, spoke as openly and fervently about women's rights\".{{sfn|Ernie-Steighner|2009|p=6}} However, both of the Workmans disliked the provincial nature of life in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where they resided, and yearned to live in Europe. After both Fanny's and William's fathers died, leaving them enormous estates, the couple embarked on their first major European trip, a tour of [[Scandinavia]] and [[Germany]].{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=34}}\n\n==Move to Europe and cycling tours==\n[[File:William H. and Fanny B. Workman portrait.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Fanny and William]]\nIn 1889 the Workman family relocated to Germany citing William's health, although Pauly speculates that this may have been merely a pretext, for he recovered surprisingly quickly.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=34}} The couple's second child, Siegfried, was born shortly after they arrived in Dresden.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=34}} Although Fanny and William now had two children, Fanny refused to conform to the socially accepted role of a wife and mother, and instead became an author and adventurer.<ref name=pauly/>  She lived a vigorous life that diverged from idealized femininity in the 1800s.{{sfn|Miller|1976|pp=101, 105}}  As a [[feminist]], Fanny considered herself an example of the idea that women could equal and excel over men in the arduous life,{{sfn|Miller|1976|pp=101, 105}} and embodied the [[New Woman]] ethos of the day.{{sfn|Miller|1976|pp=101, 105}} Moreover, as Miller points out in her book about women explorers, since the ideal family of the time was a large one and information about [[birth control]] was not easily available, William's medical knowledge must have been invaluable.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=104}} The Workmans left their children with nurses while they took long trips.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|pp = 34&ndash;35, 66}} In 1893, Siegfried died from a combination of [[influenza]] and [[pneumonia]].  After his death, according to Pauly, Workman, through her [[bicycle]] tours, \"aggressively pursued an alternative identity, one that liberated her from the conventional responsibilities of wife and mother and allowed for ''her'' interests and ambitions\".{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p = 36}}  They missed their daughter's wedding to [[Sir Alexander MacRobert]] in 1911<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{citation |title=Miss Workman weds |newspaper=New York Times |date=10 July 1911 |p=1 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4883609/the_new_york_times/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> while exploring in the [[Karakoram]].{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=66}}\n\nTogether, the Workmans explored the world and co-wrote eight travel books, which describe the people, art, and architecture of the areas in which they journeyed.  The Workmans were aware of their contribution to the genre of [[travel writing]] as they commented on other writers in their own works.{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=361}} Their mountaineering narratives said little about the culture of those remote and sparsely inhabited regions; they included both lyrical descriptions of the sunset, for example, for their popular audience and detailed explanations of geographical features, such as glaciers, for their scientific readership.{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=363}}  Fanny and William added scientific elements to their writings to appeal to authoritative organizations such as the Royal Geographical Society; Fanny also believed the science would make her more legitimate in the eyes of the climbing community, but it cost her readers.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=49}} In general, their bicycling tour narratives were better received than those about their mountaineering exploits.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=106}} Fanny wrote the majority of these travel books herself, and in them she commented extensively on the plight of women wherever she traveled.<ref name=pauly/>{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=52}}\n\nStephanie Tingley writes, in her encyclopedia entry on Workman's travel writing, that there is an implied feminist criticism of the hardships women experienced and the inferior status of the women in the societies she encountered.{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=362}} As a strong-willed, outspoken supporter of women's rights, Workman used their travels to demonstrate her own abilities and to highlight the inequities other women lived under.{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=52}}  However, their travel books are written in the [[first-person perspective|first-person]] plural or [[third-person view|third-person]] singular, so it is difficult to decisively attribute views or voices to either William or Fanny.{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=362}} The Workmans' works are [[colonialist]] in that they describe the people they meet and observe as \"exotic or unusual, at worst as primitive or even subhuman\".{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=362}} However, at times they make it clear that the people they encounter see them in a similar light, demonstrating that they were sometimes aware of their own biases.{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=362}}\n\nBetween 1888 and 1893, the Workmans took bicycling tours of Switzerland, France, and Italy. In 1891, Fanny became one of the first women to climb [[Mont Blanc]].{{sfn|Plint|1992&ndash;1993|p=232}} She also was one of the first women to climb the [[Jungfrau]] and the [[Matterhorn]]; her guide was [[Peter Taugwalder]], who had made the first ascent with [[Edward Whymper]].{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p = 51}} In 1893, the couple decided to explore areas beyond Europe and headed for [[Algeria]], [[Indochina]], and [[India]].{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=52}} These longer trips were Fanny's idea.<ref name=leonard/> The couple's first extended tour was a {{convert|2,800|mi|km|adj = on}} bicycle trip across Spain in 1895; each of them carried {{convert|20|lb|kg}} of luggage and they averaged {{convert|45|mi|km}} a day, sometimes riding up to {{convert|80|mi|km}}. Afterwards, they co-wrote ''Sketches Awheel in Modern Iberia'' about their trip.<ref name=leonard/> In it, they described Spain as \"rustic, quaint, and charming\",{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=37}} a common travel writing motif that did not make their book fresh or original. In ''Algerian Memories'' Fanny focused on the beauty and romance of the countryside, avoiding any commentary on the appalling urban conditions. However, she did highlight the abuse and neglect of women in Algerian society.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=37}}\n\n== India ==\n[[File:FannyWorkmanBicycle.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Bullock Workman on her bicycle tour of India (c. 1897)]]\nThe Workmans' trip to India, [[Burma]], [[Ceylon]], and [[Java]] lasted two and a half years, beginning in November 1897, and covered {{convert|14,000|mi|km}}. At the time, Fanny was 38 and William 50. They bicycled about {{convert|4000|mi|km}} from the southernmost tip of India to the Himalaya in the north. In order to ensure that they had access to supplies, they rode along major thoroughfares near railways, and were sometimes forced to sleep in railway waiting rooms if no other accommodation was available. They carried minimal supplies, including tea, sugar, biscuits, cheese, tinned meats, water, pillows, a blanket for each of them, writing materials, and medical and repair kits.{{sfn|Tinling|1989|p=308}} They dispensed with their bicycles at the northern end of their trip and hiked over passes between {{convert|14,000|ft|m}} and {{convert|18,000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Tinling|1989|p=308}}{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=38}} The trip was grueling. They often had little food or water, dealt with swarms of mosquitoes, fixed as many as 40 bicycle tire punctures per day, and slept in rat-infested quarters.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=110}} Fanny Workman's book, written after the trip, highlighted the ancient architecture that they had seen rather than the contemporary local cultures.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=38}} Mrs Workmans mentions in \"My Asiatic Wanderings\" about India \"I have wheeled through much enchanting scenery, in the palm and banyan grooves of [[Orissa]], Over the green and scarlet slopes of the [[Terai]]... But I have never cycled 1200 miles in a country so continuously beautiful.\" <ref>http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH18990919.2.104&srpos=49&dliv=none&e=-------en--20--41--txt-txIN-orissa-------1 \" American Woman Cyclist in Java\"], ''[[Los Angeles Herald,]]'', LA, Number 354, 19 September 1899. Retrieved on 09 June 2016.</ref> The Workmans possessed an unusual amount of historical knowledge about India for Westerners of the time and had read the ''[[Jakata]]'', ''[[Mahabharata]]'', and ''[[Ramayana]]'' before their trip. They were eager to learn about the culture that had produced these epics and spent more time learning about ancient history than interacting with living people.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=110}}\n\n=== Labor issues ===\nDuring the summer of 1898, the couple decided to escape the heat and explore the western [[Himalaya]] and [[Karakoram]]. After that, they intended to explore the area around [[Kanchenjunga]] in [[Sikkim]], and then finally travel to the mountains bordering [[Bhutan]] on the east. Bureaucratic difficulties and weather problems abounded and impeded their plans.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=113}} The most serious problems concerned labor. They hired 45 [[Porter (carrier)|porters]], outfitted them for basic mountain travel, and bought provisions, but costs skyrocketed as news of wealthy Americans circulated in the villages. They could not leave until October 3 and by then cold weather was approaching.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=113}} The Workmans complain in their writings about the porters they hired, who were difficult to work with{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=38}} and refused to trek more than {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} per day.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=113}} Three days into their journey the Workmans reached snow and the porters rebelled; they refused to work in such cold conditions and forced the entire party to return to [[Darjeeling]].{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=38}}\n\nThe Workmans struggled with labor problems continually, needing local porters to carry gear for them because they could not carry a sufficient amount for themselves for a multi-month expedition.  They had to transport [[Mummery tent]]s, [[eider]] sleeping bags, camera equipment, scientific instruments, and a large supply of food.{{sfn|Tinling|1989|p = 309}}{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p = 40}} The porters were skeptical of the entire venture.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p = 40}} The locals rarely climbed mountains and were not used to taking orders from a woman, which made Fanny's position difficult.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p = 40}} The Workmans tried to solve these problems with condescension and high-handedness. Kenneth Mason maintains in his history of Himalayan mountaineering, written in 1955, that \"The Workmans were, on their journeys, the victims of their own faults. They were too impatient and rarely tried to understand the mentality of the porters and so did not get the best out of them.\"{{sfn|Mason|1955|p = 131}} Labor problems beset all of their expeditions because, as Miller puts it, \"Almost alone of Victorian travellers, the Workmans had absolutely no sympathy or even common-sense understanding of the local people, into whose poor and remote villages they burst with trains of followers demanding service and supplies.\"{{sfn|Middleton|1965|p = 84}} In her chapter on Workman, Miller argues that the couple, being American, did not have the same sense of [[caste]] or class that British explorers had: \"the Workmans, like most of their countrymen, plunged in their enterprises headlong, expecting their enormous energy to overcome all obstacles. They were justifiably criticized by the British for their callous, incompetent behavior toward the Indians.\"{{sfn|Miller|1976|pp = 114\u2013115}}\n\n== Mountaineering in the Himalayas ==\n{{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"We had breathed the atmosphere of that great mountain-world, had drunk of the swirling waters of its glaciers, and feasted our eyes on the incomparable beauty and majesty of its towering peaks, and, as time passed on, its charms asserted their power anew and called to us with irresistible, siren strains to return yet once again to those regions, the grandeur of which satisfies so fully the sense of the beautiful and sublime.\"<br/> \u2014William and Fanny Workman, ''The Call of the Snowy Hispar''{{sfn|Tinling|1989|p=309}}}}\nAfter travelling to the Himalaya the first time, the Workmans became entranced with climbing and mountaineering. Over a span of 14 years, they traveled eight times to the area, which at the time was almost completely unexplored and unmapped.<ref name=leonard/>{{sfn|Tinling|1989|p=305}} Their trips were made without the benefit of modern lightweight equipment, freeze-dried foods, sunblock, or radios. On each expedition, they explored, surveyed, and photographed, ultimately reporting on their findings and creating maps.{{sfn|Tinling|1989|p=305}} The couple shared and alternated responsibilities; one year Fanny would organize the logistics of their journey and William would work on the scientific projects and the next year they would reverse roles.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=122}}\n\nAfter their first trip to the Himalaya and subsequent labor problems, the Workmans hired [[Matthias Zurbriggen]], the best and most experienced mountain climbing guide of the time.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=41}} Thus, in 1899, with 50 local porters and Zurbriggen, the Workmans began to explore the [[Biafo Glacier]] in the Karakoram, but dangerous [[crevasse]]s and poor weather forced them instead to shift to the Skoro La Glacier and the unclimbed peaks around it. They reached Siegfriedhorn, an 18,600-foot (5,700 m) summit that she named after her son, giving Fanny an [[World altitude record (mountaineering)|altitude record for women]] at the time.<ref name=leonard/>{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=42}} They next camped at {{convert|17,000|ft|m}} and climbed a higher peak of {{convert|19,450|ft|m}}, naming it Mount Bullock Workman.<ref>Historian Michael Plint comments that the names \"Mount Bullock Workman\" and \"Mount Siegfriedhorn are \"long forgotten\" (p. 234).</ref>{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=43}} Admiring the view of a far-off mountain, they commented on the grand view: they were looking at [[K2]], the second-highest mountain in the world. Fanny Workman may have been the first woman recorded to have seen it.{{sfn|Jordan|2009|p=5}} Finally, they climbed Koser Gunge ({{convert|20,997|ft|m|disp = or}}), giving Fanny her third successive altitude record.{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=53}} It was very challenging: they had to hire new porters, establish a new base camp, and remain overnight at around {{convert|18,000|ft|m}}. In the morning, they climbed a wall that measured {{convert|1200|ft|m}}, and were buffeted by winds. During the summit push, Fanny's fingers were so numb that she could no longer hold her [[ice ax]] and one of the porters abandoned them. Pauly writes, \"propelled to the summit by adrenalin and desperation, the foursome lingered only long enough for their instruments to assess that the temperature was ten degrees Fahrenheit [\u221212&nbsp;\u00b0C] and their elevation was 21,000 feet.\"{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=43}}  Fanny was a \"slow, relentless, and intrepid\" climber; \"bearlike, she solidly planted one foot and then groped for another secure grip with the other\".{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=43}} Climbing at the beginning of the 20th century, she did not have specialized equipment like [[piton]]s or [[carabiner]]s. She was able to climb to such heights, Pauly argues, because of \"her dauntless persistence and her immunity to [[altitude sickness]]\".{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=43}}\n\nAs soon as she was able, Fanny Workman published accounts of her feats, such as an article in the ''[[Scottish Geographical Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=44}} Writing about this trip at length in ''In the Ice World of the Himalayas'', Fanny made efforts to include scientific information and experiments, touting her own modified [[barometer]] as superior, but scholarly critics were unimpressed and pointed out her lack of scientific knowledge.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|pp=45&ndash;46}} Popular reviewers, on the other hand, enjoyed the book, with one concluding, \"We have no hesitation in saying that Dr. and Mrs. Workman have written one of the most remarkable books of travel of recent years.\"{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Fanny bullock workman d 1922.jpg|left|thumb|Workman with climbing gear.

They also attempted to climb the nearby mountain they called [[Spantik|Pyramid Peak]] (later renamed Spantik, as part of the [[Spantik-Sosbun Mountains]]). They camped the first night at {{convert|16,200|ft|m}} and the second at {{convert|18,600|ft|m}}. An ailing porter forced them to camp the third night at {{convert|19,355|ft|m}} rather than {{convert|20,000|ft|m}} and they eventually left him behind. They ascended a {{convert|22,567|ft|m|adj = on}} peak, giving Fanny a new altitude record. William and a porter climbed toward the needle-like spire that was the expedition's goal. However, he abandoned the summit attempt a few hundred feet from the top because he realized they could not have descended to a safe altitude before altitude sickness set in.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=47}}\n\nAfter returning from their travels, the Workmans lectured all over Europe. Fanny lectured in English, German, or French, as the occasion required. At one talk in [[Lyon]], France, 1000 people crowded into the auditorium and 700 were turned away.{{sfn|Plint|1992\u20131993|p=234}} In 1905 Fanny became the second woman to address the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. ([[Isabella Bird Bishop]] had been the first in May 1897.){{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=53}}{{sfn|Middleton|1965|p=81}} Her talk was mentioned in ''[[The Times]]''.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=48}}\n\nThe Workmans returned to [[Kashmir]] in 1906, and were the first Westerners to explore the [[Nun Kun]] massif. For this trip, the couple hired six Italian porters from the Alps, 200 local porters, and Savoye returned as guide.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=49}} As Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar explain in their history of Himalayan mountaineering, the Workmans despised the local porters but were forced to recruit them; \"their otherwise invaluable books read like one long, anguished harangue against the lazy, lying, thieving, mutinous cheats on whom they unhappily depended for local support\".{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=55}} They planned a sequence of four camps from {{convert|17,657|ft|m}} to {{convert|21,000|ft|m}}. Despite labor problems, the Workmans spent the night higher than any previous mountaineers&mdash;{{convert|20,278|ft|m}} on top of Z1 on Nun Kun&mdash;at what they called \"Camp America\".{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|pp=55&ndash;56}}{{sfn|Miller|1976|pp=122&ndash;123}} William wrote of Fanny: {{quote|1=She concentrated her attention on the end in view, often disregarding the difficulties and even the dangers that might lie in the way of accomplishment. She went forward with a determination to succeed and a courage that won success where a less determined effort would have failed. She believed in taking advantage of every opportunity. She was no quitter, and was never the first to suggest turning back in the face of discouraging circumstances.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=122}}}}\nThe map the Workmans made during this trip was of low quality. According to Mason, the couple did not have a good sense of topographical direction, which meant that their measurements were inaccurate and unusable by the [[Survey of India]].{{sfn|Mason|1955|p=111}}\n\n===Pinnacle Peak and altitude record===\n[[File:Kun and Pinnacle.jpg|right|thumb|[[Nun Kun|Mount Kun]] (center) and [[Pinnacle Peak (Jammu and Kashmir)|Pinnacle Peak]] (left) from the Suru Valley]]\nFrom {{convert|20,278|ft|m}}, at the age of 47 in 1906, Workman climbed up to [[Pinnacle Peak (Jammu and Kashmir)|Pinnacle Peak]] ({{convert|22,735|ft|m|disp = or}}) (which she believed to be {{convert|23,263|ft|m|disp = or}}), a subsidiary peak in the [[Nun Kun]] massif of the western [[Himalaya]]. It was her greatest mountaineering achievement.  As Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar point out, the fact that she \"climbed the mountain at all, without benefit of modern equipment and encumbered by her voluminous skirts, speaks to both her ability and resolve\".{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=56}} She set an altitude record for women that would stand until [[Hetti Dhyrenfurth]]'s 1934 ascent of [[Sia Kangri]] C ({{convert|23,861|ft|m|disp = or}}).{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=56}} Believing that they had both climbed above the 23,000-foot (7,000 m) mark, Fanny and William now considered themselves the leading experts on climbing at altitude.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=49}}\n\nWorkman vigorously defended her Pinnacle Peak altitude record against all other claimants, especially [[Annie Smith Peck]]. In 1908, Peck claimed a new record with her climb of Peru's [[Huascar\u00e1n]], which she believed to be {{convert|23,000|ft|m}}. However, she was misinformed as to the peak's height and exaggerated distances she could not measure.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|pp=64&ndash;65}} Workman was so competitive that she paid a team of French surveyors from the [[Institut g\u00e9ographique national|Service G\u00e9ographique de l'Arm\u00e9e]] US$13,000 to measure the elevation of the mountain, which was actually {{convert|22,205|ft|m}}, confirming her record.<ref name=leonard/>{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=123}} Pauly explains, \"Ironically, her determination to prove herself the equal of any man at lofty elevations culminated with a withering attack on an American woman who tried to surpass her\".<ref name=pauly/> Determined to be the best woman, Workman was also a meticulous record-keeper so that she could prove her accomplishments.  Pauly concludes, \"If Fanny Workman ever receives the recognition she deserves for her feminist determination to excel at this then-male sport, she will surely be remembered as much for her insistence upon accurate record-keeping as for the elevations she achieved.\"<ref name=pauly/>\n\n===Hispar and Siachen Glaciers===\n[[File:FannyBullockWorkmanVotesWomen.jpg|right|thumb|Fanny Workman on the Silver Throne Plateau holding up a newspaper that reads \"Votes for Women\"]]\nIn 1908, the Workmans returned to the [[Karakorum|Karakoram]] and explored the 38-mile-long (61&nbsp;km) [[Hispar Glacier]] in the [[Hunza Nagar]] region; they went from [[Gilgit]] to [[Nagir]] over the Hispar pass ({{convert|17,500|ft|m|disp = or}}) and onto the 37-mile-long (60&nbsp;km) [[Biafo Glacier]] to [[Askole]].{{sfn|Mason|1955|p=131}} Their total traverse of the glaciers was another record, and Fanny became the first woman to travel across any Himalayan glacier of this size.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=123}} They were the first to explore its many side glaciers and the maps created by their Italian porters helped map the region for the first time.{{sfn|Plint|1992\u20131993|p=235}} They recorded the physiological effects of high altitude, studied glaciers and ice pinnacles, and took meteorological measurements, including altitude data recorded with both aneroid barometers and boiling point thermometers.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=124}}\n\nThe Workmans' exploration of the [[Rose Glacier]] and the 45-mile-long (72&nbsp;km) [[Siachen Glacier]] in [[Baltistan]] around [[Masherbrum]] in 1911 and 1912 was the most important achievement of their careers because it was the widest and longest subpolar glacier in the world and at the time, the least explored and accessible glacier as well.{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=56}} For two months, the Workmans explored the 45-mile glacier, climbed several mountains, and mapped the area. They spent the entire time over {{convert|15,000|ft|m}},   the high point being [[Indira Col]] which they summitted and named.{{sfn|Plint|1992\u20131993|p=236}} On this expedition, one of their Italian guides fell into a [[crevasse]] and died; Fanny was lucky to escape. The others were badly shaken but decided to carry on.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=125}} Fanny led them across the [[Sia La]] pass ({{convert|18,700|ft|m|disp = or}}) near the head of the Siachen Glacier and through a previously unexplored region to the [[Kaberi Glacier]]. This exploration and the resulting book were among her greatest accomplishments.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=126}} As she wrote in her book about the trip, ''Two Summers in the Ice-Wilds of Eastern Karakoram'', she organized and led this expedition: \"Dr. Hunter Workman accompanied me, this time, in charge with me of commissariat and as photographer and glacialist, but I was the responsible leader of this expedition, and on my efforts, in a large measure, must depend the success or failure of it\".{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=364}} At one 21,000-foot (6,400 m) plateau, Fanny unfurled a \"Votes for Women\" newspaper and her husband snapped an iconic picture.<ref name=leonard/>{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|pp=56&ndash;57}}  They took trained Alpine guides and surveyors including [[Grant Peterkin]] and [[Surjan Singh]],{{sfn|Mason|1955|p=139}} whose contributions ensured that, unlike numerous other maps the Workmans helped create, their map of the Siachen Glacier remained unchallenged for many years.{{sfn|Middleton|1965|p=88}}\n\n==Later life and death==\n[[File:Fanny Bullock Workman Monument Rural Cemetery Worcester Mass.jpg|thumb|Monument dedicated to Fanny Bullock Workman, Rural Cemetery Worcester, Massachusetts (Plot 1500 Sec. 31)]]\nAfter their 1908\u201312 trip, the couple stopped exploring and turned to writing and lecturing, primarily because of the onset of [[World War I]] in 1914.{{sfn|Middleton|1965|p=89}} Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris.<ref name=leonard/> She was also one of the first women to be admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena.<ref name=pauly>{{cite news|last=Pauly|first=Thomas H.|title=Vita: Fanny Bullock Workman|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/vita-fanny-bullock-workman|accessdate=14 October 2013|newspaper=Harvard Magazine|date=March\u2013April 2012}}</ref> She also earned medals of honor from 10 European geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of the [[American Alpine Club]], [[Royal Asiatic Society]], [[Club Alpino Italiano]], [[German and Austrian Alpine Club|Deutscher und \u00d6sterreichischer Alpenverein]], and [[Club alpin fran\u00e7ais]].<ref name=leonard/> She was very proud of these achievements, listing them on the title pages of her books.{{sfn|Tinling|1989|p=305}}\n\nFanny Workman fell ill in 1917 and died after a long illness in 1925 in [[Cannes]], France.

When, later, woman occupies her acknowledged position as an individual worker in all fields, as well as those of exploration, no such emphasis of her work will be needed; but that day has not fully arrived, and at present it behooves women, for the benefit of their sex, to put what they do, at least, on record.\"<br/> \u2014Fanny Workman, ''Two Summers in the Ice-Wilds of Eastern Karakoram''{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=128}}}}\n\n===Women in climbing===\nAlong with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was recognized during the early 20th century as one of the most famous female climbers in the world.{{sfn|Ellis|2001|p=96}} Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet, and achieve the same accomplishments as male mountaineers. It was not until Peck and Workman's feats that women had been involved in [[mountaineering]], though they had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s. In the Himalaya, in particular, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy Englishmen.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|pp=66&ndash;67}} No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had reduced the risk and the difficulty of the expeditions.{{sfn|Miller|1976|p=120}}\n\nWorkman, herself an ardent feminist and a supporter of women's suffrage, wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women's potential.{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=363}} In her writings, Workman described herself as \"questioning or violating the norms of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] female propriety\".{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=364}} She demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside the home by showing how easy it was for her to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot, humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes.{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=364}} Workman challenged a masculine realm; her obituary in the ''[[Alpine Journal]]'' alluded to the challenges she faced, saying that she \"felt that she suffered from 'sex antagonism'\".{{sfn|Colley|2010|p=116}} The author of the piece added: \"it is possible that some unconscious feeling let us say of the novelty of a woman's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man, may in some quarters have existed&nbsp;... there tended to arise&nbsp;... an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness?\"{{sfn|Colley|2010|p=116}} However, in her study of Victorian mountaineering, Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations, such as in the Himalaya. Colley states, \"Away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures, up high, above the snow line or in distant regions, women climbers could more fully experience equality and power&nbsp;... If they chose, they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as the men.\"{{sfn|Colley|2010|p=136}} In her entry about Workman in the ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'', Tingley sums Workman up as \"an aggressive, determined, and uncompromising turn-of-the-century American woman traveler\" and \"one of the first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about the expeditions she and her husband took to the most remote reaches of the Himalaya. She was an outspoken advocate of woman's suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself to be a role model for other women travelers and mountaineers.\"{{sfn|Tingley|1998|p=360}}\n\nAs a result of the money Workman left in her will, [[Wellesley College]] offers a $16,000 fellowship named after Fanny Workman for graduate study in any discipline to a Wellesley graduate each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wellesley College Graduate Fellowships and Scholarships|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/cws/fellowships/wellesley|publisher=Wellesley College|accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] established a Fanny Bullock Workman Traveling Fellowship, which is awarded to Ph.D candidates in Archaeology or Art History when funds permit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Financial support|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/gsas/Resources/financial_support.html|publisher=Bryn Mawr College|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Exploration of the Himalaya===\nThe many books and articles produced by the Workmans are \"still useful\" according to Mason, especially for their photographs and illustrations, but their maps are \"deceptive and not always reliable\".{{sfn|Mason|1955|p=132}} One assessment states that although the Workmans excelled at describing meteorological conditions, glaciology, and how high altitudes affected human health and fitness, they were poor topographers.{{sfn|Kraig|1999}}  The Workmans were some of the first mountaineers to grasp that the Himalaya were the place for the ultimate climbing challenge and their explorations helped evolve mountaineering from strenuous recreation into a serious, regulated competitive sport.{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=67}} According to Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar, \"that the Workmans were intrepid explorers and climbers none could possibly doubt, but they were also aggressive self-promoters who in their eagerness for recognition and honors sometimes exaggerated the originality and significance of what they had done.\"{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=53}} In their final assessment, Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar say \"they had logged more miles and climbed more peaks than anyone to date; they had produced five sumptuously illustrated and widely read expedition volumes; and by simple virtue of her sex Fanny of course had set an invaluable Himalayan precedent. But the Workmans were not great mountaineers. At their best they were vigorous and competent patrons who followed capably in the hard-won steps of their Italian guides.\"{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=57}} However, in his chapter on Workman, Pauly writes that \"the few recent accounts of Fanny Workman have tended to slight or belittle her achievements, but contemporaries, unaware of the far greater accomplishments to come, held the Workmans in high regard.\"{{sfn|Pauly|2012|p=197, note 2}} They were the first Americans to explore the Himalaya in depth and break the British monopoly over Himalayan mountaineering.{{sfn|Isserman|Weaver|Molenaar|2008|p=57}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book|title=Algerian memories : a bicycle tour over the Atlas to the Sahara|date=1895|publisher=T.F.

Her father was a railroad executive.\n\nJanet served as a [[Red Cross]] nurse in the [[French Third Republic]] during [[World War I]]. In 1919, she left New York for [[Paris]], where she married [[Frederick Wulsin]], a [[Harvard University]] graduate from a prominent [[Ohio]] family. \n\nInspired by the travels of [[Roy Chapman Andrews]], the Wulsins resolved to travel the world. From 1921 to 1925, the couple mounted expeditions to the far reaches of [[China]], [[Tibet]], and [[Outer Mongolia]] to study the people, flora, and fauna of the region. With a grant from the [[National Geographic Society]], they took 28 camels, six horses, four Mongolian camel drivers and 10 Chinese \"specimen collectors.\" Together, the Wulsins collected 1,400 botanical and zoological specimens and documented Buddhist rituals. They also took hundreds of photographs, documented tribespeople and desert landscapes, and were even allowed to photograph the interior of several of the great [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] [[lamaseries]], one of few early Westerners allowed to do so.\n\nIn 1926, [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] published one account of their expeditions, but Janet's contributions went uncredited. Stray newspaper articles in the United States were often misleading or inaccurate. The Wulsins returned to the [[United States]] in 1925, and divorced in 1929. Elliott remarried Richard Hobart, a banker and collector of Chinese art.\n\nJanet's role in her first husband's expeditions went largely uncredited until after her death in 1963, when her daughter, [[Muffie Cabot|Mabel Cabot]], mother of [[Ali Wentworth]], found her mother's private letters and diaries and published ''Vanished Kingdoms'' (ISBN 0-641-68638-2), a biographical account of Janet's explorations.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wursin, Janet}}\n[[Category:1894 births]]\n[[Category:1963 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from New York]]\n[[Category:American nurses]]\n[[Category:American women in World War I]]\n[[Category:American explorers]]\n[[Category:Female wartime nurses]]\n[[Category:Female explorers]]\n[[Category:World War I nurses]]"}]},"17845803":{"pageid":17845803,"ns":0,"title":"Su-Lin Young","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"'''Adelaide \"Su-Lin\" Young''' (23 December 1911 &ndash; 17 April 2008) was an [[United States|American]] [[exploration|explorer]], [[journalist]], and [[disc jockey]].
