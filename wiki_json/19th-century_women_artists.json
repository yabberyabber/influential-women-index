She began painting in her early teens, and studied under such notables of the period as [[Charles Joshua Chaplin]], [[Jean-Jacques Henner]] and [[Carolus-Duran]]. She first received recognition for her work at age 23 when she painted a portrait of [[Sarah Bernhardt]], her lifelong friend and possibly her lover.<ref name=\"bernhadt\">{{cite book |title=The Bernhardt Hamlet: culture and context |first=Gerda |last=Taranow |publisher=P.

Abb\u00e9ma was also among the female artists whose works were exhibited in the Women's Building at the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Clude J.|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|date=2004|publisher=Cleis|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=1573441910|page=2}}</ref> A bust Sarah Bernhardt sculpted of Abb\u00e9ma was also exhibited at the exposition.\n\nAbb\u00e9ma specialized in oil portraits and watercolors, and many of her works showed the influence from Chinese and Japanese painters, as well as contemporary masters such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. She frequently depicted flowers in her works. Among her best-known works are ''The Seasons'', ''April Morning, Place de la Concorde'', ''Among the Flowers'', ''Winter'', and portraits of actress Jeanne Samary, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil]], [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], and [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]].\n\nAbb\u00e9ma was also an accomplished printmaker, sculptor, and designer, as well as a writer who made regular contributions to the journals ''Gazette des Beaux-Arts'' and ''L'Art''.\n\nAmong the many honors conferred upon Abb\u00e9ma was Palme Academiques, 1887<ref>\"Dictionary of Women Artists\" Edited by Gaze, Delia. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers 1997, pp161-165.</ref> and nomination as \"Official Painter of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].\" She was also awarded a bronze medal at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]. In 1906 she was decorated as [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur|Chevalier of the Order of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]].\n\nAbb\u00e9ma died in Paris in 1927. At the end of the 20th century, as contributions by women to the arts in past centuries received more critical and historical attention, her works have been enjoying a renewed popularity.\n\n==New Woman==\nAs educational opportunities were made more available in the 19th-century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, including founding their own art associations.

At age 16, her family moved to [[Florence, Italy]], where she collected folk songs, tales, and customs. Her first batch of translations of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] songs and stories, later published as ''Roadside Songs of Tuscany'', was drawn from a celebrated story-teller, Beatrice Bernardi of Pian degli Ontani. In it Alexander translated [[Bartolomeo Casenti]]'s ottava rima ballad (1616) about a little servant girl turned saint, with Italian original opposite the translated English stanzas. Alexander illustrated her translations with drawings done in a fine and highly personal style.\n\nIn 1882 she met [[John Ruskin]], who was to be a close friend until his death. He was deeply impressed by her ''Roadside Songs'' and purchased it along with a second manuscript that he published in 1883 as ''The Story of Ida'' with its author listed simply as \"Francesca.\" The volume enjoyed several British and American editions. Ruskin then edited and published her ''Roadside Songs'' in 1884-85, and a third collection, ''Christ's Folk in the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]'', in 1887-89. An intimate correspondence between Ruskin, Alexander, and her mother continued for some years.\n\nAfter Ruskin's death Alexander published ''Tuscan Songs'' (1897) and ''The Hidden Servants and Other Very Old Stories Told Over'' (1900). She was blind and in poor health in her final years, and died in Florence on January 21, 1917.

Helen Paterson was the eldest of seven children. The family moved to [[Altrincham]] in Cheshire when she was one year old. In 1862 her father and her 3-year-old sister Isabel died of [[diphtheria]] during an epidemic.

Her younger sister [[Caroline Paterson (artist)|Caroline Paterson]] also became a noted artist. She initially studied art for three years at the Birmingham School of Design (founded 1843). From 1867 she attended the National Art Training School in London, which had a separate division for women; her aunt Laura Herford had previously studied there. The School is presently the [[Royal College of Art]].<ref name=Watts>{{cite web |url=http://www.artmagick.com/pictures/artist.aspx?artist=helen-allingham |title=Helen Allingham \u2013 Biography and Image Gallery at ArtMagick |work=ArtMagick |last=Watts |first=Annabel}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Allingham The saucer of milk.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The saucer of milk]]\n[[File:Rear view of Craigenputtock in 1891.png|thumb|Allingham's watercolour painting of [[Craigenputtock]], the home of [[Thomas Carlyle]]]]\nWhile studying at the National Art Training School, Paterson worked as an illustrator, eventually deciding to give up her studies in favour of a full-time career in art.

After her marriage she gave up her career as an illustrator and turned to [[watercolour painting]]. In 1881 the family moved from [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] to [[Witley]] in Surrey. Helen started to paint the beautiful countryside around her and particularly the picturesque farmhouses and cottages of Surrey and Sussex for which she became famous. To her critics, however, despite elements of protest in 'The Condemned Cottage' for example, hers was an overly sentimental, conservative vision of the area.<ref>Alison Light, ''Mrs Woolf and the Servants'' (2007) p. 102</ref> She went on to paint rural scenes in other parts of the country \u2013 [[Middlesex]], Kent, the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[West Country]] \u2013 and abroad in [[Venice]], Italy. As well as landscapes, she completed several portraits, including one of [[Thomas Carlyle]].

She was the only one of the Skagen Painters who was actually born and grew up in [[Skagen]], where her father owned the [[Br\u00f8ndums Hotel]]. The artistic talent of Anna Ancher became obvious at an early age, and she grew acquainted with pictorial art via the many artists who settled to paint in Skagen, in the north of Jutland.\n\nWhile she studied drawing for three years at the [[Vilhelm Kyhn|Vilhelm Kyhn College of Painting]] in [[Copenhagen]], she developed her own style and was a pioneer in observing the interplay of different colors in natural light. She also studied drawing in [[Paris]] at the atelier of [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] along with [[Marie Triepcke Kr\u00f8yer Alfv\u00e9n|Marie Triepcke]], who would marry [[Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer]], another Skagen painter. In 1880 she married fellow painter [[Michael Ancher]], whom she met in Skagen. They had one child, daughter [[Helga Ancher]]. Despite pressure from society that married women should devote themselves to household duties, she continued painting after marriage.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/dbl/1/0217.html ''Ancher, Anna Kirstine'' (Dansk biografisk Lexikon)] {{da icon}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAnna Ancher was considered to be one of the great Danish pictorial artists by virtue of her abilities as a character painter and colorist.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Anna_Kirstine_Ancher \"Anna Ancher\"], ''Den Lille Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 16 October 2011.</ref> Her art found its expression in Nordic art's modern breakthrough towards a more truthful depiction of reality, e.g. in ''Blue Ane'' (1882) and ''The Girl in the Kitchen'' (1883\u20131886).<ref name=anchershus>[http://www.anchershus.dk/anna_ancher.html \"Anna Ancher\"], ''Michael og Anna Anchers Hus''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 16 October 2011.</ref>\n\nAncher preferred to paint interiors and simple themes from the everyday lives of the Skagen people, especially fishermen, women and children. She was intensely preoccupied with exploring light and color, as in ''Interior with Clematis'' (1913). She also created more complex compositions such as ''A Funeral'' (1891).

When her father, the Prince Consort, died on 14 December 1861, the court went into a period of intense mourning, to which Louise was unsympathetic. Louise was an able [[sculptor]] and artist, and several of her sculptures remain today.

She held that \"the subject of Domestic Economy lies at the root of the \u2013 highest life of every true woman.\"{{sfn|Morgan|1903|p=1}}\n\nBefore her marriage, Louise served as an unofficial secretary to her mother, the Queen (1866\u20131871). The question of Louise's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s.

Louise's marriage survived thanks to long periods of separation, but the couple reconciled in 1911, and she was devastated by her husband's death in 1914. After the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1918, at the age of 70, she began to retire from public life, undertaking few public duties outside [[Kensington Palace]], where she died at age 91.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Henrietta Montalba.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Henrietta Montalba]] painted by Princess Louise in 1882]]\nLouise was born on 18 March 1848 at [[Buckingham Palace]], [[London]].{{sfn|Marshall|1972|p=122}} She was the fourth daughter and sixth child of the reigning British monarch, [[Queen Victoria]], and her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. As the daughter of the sovereign, Louise was styled ''[[Royal Highness|Her Royal Highness]] The Princess Louise'' from birth. Her birth coincided with [[revolutions of 1848|revolutions]] which swept across [[Europe]], prompting the Queen to remark that Louise would turn out to be \"something peculiar\".{{sfn|Longford|1987|p=195}} The Queen's labour with Louise was the first to be aided with [[chloroform]].{{sfn|Longford|1987|p=195}}\n\nAlbert and Victoria chose the names ''Louisa Caroline Alberta''. Louise was chosen to honour [[Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Albert's mother]]. Though christened Louisa in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by [[John Bird Sumner]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], on 13 May 1848, she was invariably known as Louise throughout her life.<ref name=\"London Gazette 17 May 1848\"/> Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); [[Marie Fredericka of Hesse-Kassel|The Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen]] (for whom her great-aunt [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]] stood proxy); and [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge|The Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] (her first cousin once-removed, for whom the Hereditary Grand Duchess's mother [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel|The Duchess of Cambridge]] stood proxy).<ref name=\"London Gazette 17 May 1848\"/> During the ceremony, [[Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh|The Duchess of Gloucester]], one of the few children of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] who was still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly got up in the middle of the service and knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.{{sfn|Longford|1987|p=195}}\n\n[[File:Queen Victoria (1819-1901), after Franz Xavier Winterhalter - Portrait of Princess Louise (1848-1939).jpg|left|thumb|Queen Victoria painted a portrait of Princess Louise after an original by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]]]\nLike her siblings, Louise was brought up with the strict programme of education devised by her father, Prince Albert, and his friend and confidant, [[Christian Friedrich, Baron Stockmar|Baron Stockmar]]. The young children were taught practical tasks, such as cooking, farming, household tasks and carpentry.{{sfn|Mart\u00ednez|2005}}\n\nFrom her early years, Louise was a talented and intelligent child, and her artistic talents were quickly recognised.{{sfn|Ralph Lewis|1996}} On his visit to [[Osborne House]] in 1863, [[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson|Hallam Tennyson]], the son of the poet [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], remarked that Louise could \"draw beautifully\".<ref>Lang, p. 325</ref> Because of her royal rank, an artistic career was not considered. However, the Queen first allowed her to attend art school under the tutelage of the sculptor [[Mary Thornycroft]], and later (1863) allowed her to study at the [[Royal College of Art|National Art Training School]],<ref>Now named [[The Royal College of Art]].</ref> [[South Kensington]].{{sfn|Stocker 2004, Louise, Princess, duchess of Argyll}} Louise also became an able dancer, and Victoria wrote, after a dance, that Louise \"danced [[Scottish sword dances|the sword dance]] with more verve and accuracy than any of her sisters\".{{sfn|McDougall 1988, Youth (1848\u20131878)}} Her wit and intelligence made her a favourite with her father,{{sfn|Cantelupe|1949}} with her inquisitive nature earning her the nickname \"Little Miss Why\" from other members of the royal family.{{sfn|McDougall 1988, Youth (1848\u20131878)}}\n\n==Death of Prince Albert==\n[[File:Louise 1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|Princess Louise in the 1860s]]\nLouise's father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The Queen was devastated, and ordered her household to move from Windsor to [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and morbid in the wake of the Prince's death, and entertainments became dry and dull.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=73}} Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother's prolonged mourning.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=73}} For her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a [[debutante]] dance, the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert's death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative.{{sfn|Stocker 2004, Louise, Princess, duchess of Argyll}}\n\nThe Queen comforted herself by rigidly continuing with Prince Albert's plans for their children. [[Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]] was married to [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse|Prince Louis]], the future [[Grand Duke of Hesse]], at [[Osborne House|Osborne]] on 1 June 1862. In 1863, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward]], the [[Prince of Wales]], married [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra of Denmark]]. The Queen made it a tradition that the eldest unmarried daughter would become her unofficial secretary, a position which Louise filled in 1866, despite the Queen's concern that she was indiscreet.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=73}}\n\nLouise, however, proved to be good at the job: Victoria wrote shortly afterwards: \"She is (and who would some years ago have thought it?) a clever dear girl with a fine strong character, unselfish and affectionate.\"<ref>Quoted by {{harvnb|McDougall 1988, Youth (1848\u20131878)}}.</ref> However, when Louise fell in love with her brother Leopold's tutor, the Reverend [[Robinson Duckworth]] (14 years her senior), between 1866 and 1870, the Queen reacted by dismissing Duckworth in 1870. He later became [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Chomet|1999|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nLouise was bored at court, and by fulfilling her duties, which were little more than minor secretarial tasks, such as writing letters on the Queen's behalf; dealing with political correspondence; and providing the Queen with company, she had more responsibilities.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=204}}\n\n==Marriage==\n\n===Suitors===\nAs a daughter of the Queen, Louise was a desirable bride; more so as she is regarded as the Queen's most beautiful daughter by both contemporary and modern biographers.<ref>The biographers Jehanne Wake, Elizabeth Longford and Mark Stocker claim this.</ref> However, she was accused by the press, without substantiation, of romantic affairs.{{sfn|Stocker 2004, Louise, Princess, duchess of Argyll}} This, coupled with her [[liberalism]] and [[feminism]], prompted the Queen to find her a husband. The choice had to suit Victoria as well as Louise, and the Queen insisted that her daughter's husband should live near her, a promise which had also been extracted from the husband of Helena, Louise's sister. Various suitors were proposed by the leading royal houses of Europe: [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] proposed her brother, the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]], but the Queen was strongly opposed to another Danish marriage that could antagonise [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].<ref>Prussia and Denmark were in conflict over the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] question.</ref> [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], Louise's eldest sister, proposed the tall and rich [[Prince Albert of Prussia (1837\u20131906)|Prince Albert of Prussia]], but Queen Victoria disapproved of another Prussian marriage that would have been unpopular in England.{{sfn|Buckle|1926|p=632}} Prince Albert was also reluctant to settle in England as required. [[Prince William of the Netherlands|William, Prince of Orange]] was also considered a suitor, but because of his extravagant lifestyle in [[Paris]], where he lived openly with a [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], the Queen quickly vetoed the idea.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=100}}\n\n[[File:Princess Louise and Lorne engagement.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Princess Louise and Marquess of Lorne. The official engagement photo (W & D Downey, 1870)]]\nLouise viewed marriage to any prince as undesirable, and announced that she wished to marry [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|John Campbell]], [[Marquess of Lorne]], heir to the [[Duke of Argyll|Dukedom of Argyll]]. No such marriage, between a daughter of a Sovereign and a British subject, had been given official recognition since 1515, when [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Charles Brandon]], the first [[Duke of Suffolk]], married [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]].{{sfn|Stocker 2004, Louise, Princess, duchess of Argyll}} Louise's brother, the Prince of Wales, was strongly opposed to a marriage with a [[Mediatization|non-mediatized]] noble.{{sfn|Benson|1938|p=162}} Furthermore, Lorne's father, [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|George Campbell]], the eighth Duke of Argyll, was an ardent supporter of [[William Ewart Gladstone]], and the Prince of Wales was worried that he would drag the royal family into political disputes.{{sfn|Buckle|1926|p=632}} Nevertheless, the opposition was crushed by the Queen, who wrote to the Prince of Wales in 1869: {{quote|That which you object to [that Louise should marry a subject] ''I feel'' certain will be ''for'' Louise's happiness and for the peace and quiet of the family ... Times have changed; great foreign alliances are looked on as causes of trouble and anxiety, and are of no good.

You may not be aware, as I am, with what ''dislike'' the marriages of Princesses of the Royal Family with small German Princes (German beggars as they most insultingly were called) ...

Later that day, Louise returned and announced to the Queen that Lorne had \"spoken of his devotion\" to Louise, and she accepted his proposal in the knowledge of the Queen's approval.{{sfn|Victoria, Queen (More leaves)|p=74}} The Queen later gave Lady Ely a bracelet to mark the occasion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen Victoria gifted bracelet|url=http://www.paulfrasercollectibles.com/News/ROYAL-MEMORABILIA/Queen-Victoria-gifted-bracelet-up-483.3pc-in-Bonhams'-Scottish-sale/11719.page|publisher=Paul Fraser Collectibles}}</ref>\n\nThe Queen found it difficult to let go of her daughter, confiding in her journal that she \"felt painfully the thought of losing her\".{{sfn|Victoria, Queen (More leaves)|p=74}} The new breach in royal tradition caused surprise, especially in Germany, and Queen Victoria wrote to the [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar|Queen of Prussia]] that princes of small impoverished German houses were \"very unpopular\" in Britain and that Lord Lorne, a \"person of distinction at home\" with \"an independent fortune\" was \"really no lower in rank than minor German Royalty\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Benson|1938|p=166}}</ref>\n\nVictoria settled an annuity on Louise shortly before her marriage.<ref name=\"London Gazette 3 March 1871\"/> The ceremony was conducted at [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]] on 21 March 1871,<ref name=\"London Gazette 24 March 1871\"/>{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=138}} and the crowd outside was so large that, for the first time, policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=139}} Louise wore a wedding veil of [[Honiton]] lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the Chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]] and [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|the Duke of Edinburgh]]. On this occasion, the usually severe black of the Queen's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the [[Order of the Garter#Members|Garter star]]. Following the ceremony, the Queen kissed Louise, and Lorne \u2013 now a member of the royal family, but still a subject \u2013 kissed the Queen's hand.\n\nThe couple then journeyed to [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in [[Surrey]] for the honeymoon, but the presence of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, made it impossible for them to talk privately.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=145}} The short four-day visit did not pass without an interruption from the Queen, who was curious about her daughter's thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at [[Inveraray Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=First Floor|url=http://www.inveraray-castle.com/inveraray-castle-first-floor.html|publisher=Inveraray Castle}}</ref>\n\n==Viceregal Consort of Canada==\n\n===Inauspicious arrival===\nIn 1878, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], chose Lorne to be Canada's new [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], and he was duly appointed by Queen Victoria.<ref name=\"London Gazette 15 October 1878\"/> Louise thus became his [[Viceregal consort of Canada|Viceregal Consort]]. On 15 November 1878, the couple left [[Liverpool]] and arrived for the inauguration at [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]] on 25 November.{{sfn|Waite|2000}}\n\n[[File:Princess Louise in Canada.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Princess Louise in Canada]]\nLouise became the first royal to take up residence in [[Rideau Hall]], officially the Queen's royal residence in [[Ottawa]]. However, the hall was far from the splendour of British royal residences, and, as each viceregal couple decorated the hall with their own furnishings, and thus took them when they departed, the Lornes found the palace sparse in [[d\u00e9cor]] upon their arrival. Louise put her artistic talents to work and hung many of her watercolour and oil paintings around the hall, also installing her sculpted works. Though the news that a daughter of the Queen would be viceregal consort of Canada first saw a \"thrill of joy burst upon the Dominion\", it being felt that the Princess would be a strong link between Canadians and their sovereign,{{sfn|Sandwell|2006|p=48}} the arrival of the new governor general and his wife was not initially welcomed by the Canadian press, which complained about the imposition of royalty on the country's hitherto un-regal society.{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=45}}\n\nRelations with the press further deteriorated when Lorne's private secretary, [[Francis de Winton]], threw four journalists off the royal train. Although the Lornes had no knowledge of de Winton's action, it was assumed by the press that they did, and they earned an early reputation for haughtiness.{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=44}} Louise was horrified by the negative press, and when she heard about reports of \"a nation of flunkies\" at the viceregal court, taking lessons in \"the backward walk,\" Louise declared that she \"wouldn't care if they came in blanket coats!\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Longford|1991|p=45}}</ref> (A reference to the ubiquitous ''[[Capote (garment)|capote]]'', a coat made of blanket-cloth, both durable and warm.

Eventually the worries of a rigid court at Rideau Hall and the \"feeble undercurrent of criticism\" turned out to be unfounded as the royal couple proved to be more relaxed than their predecessors.{{sfn|Hubbard|1977|p=125}}\n\n===Canadian entertainments===\n[[File:Toboganning at Government House in the time of Princess Louise c 1878.JPG|thumb|right|Toboganning at Government House in the time of Princess Louise, 1878 to 1883]]\nLouise's first few months in Canada were tinged with sadness as her favourite sister, [[Alice of the United Kingdom|The Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine]], died on 14 December 1878. Although homesick over that first Christmas, Louise soon grew accustomed to the winter climate. Sleighing and skating were two of her favourite pastimes. In Canada, as the monarch's direct representative, Lorne always took precedence over his wife, so that at the [[Opening of the Canadian parliament|Opening of the Parliament of Canada]] on 13 February 1879, Louise was ranked no differently from others in attendance. She had to remain standing with the MPs, until Lorne asked them to be seated.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=226}} In order for Lorne to meet every Canadian member of Parliament, he held bi-weekly dinners for 50 people. However, some of the Canadian ladies responded negatively to the British party. One of her ladies-in-waiting reported that some had an \"'I'm as good as you' sort of manner when one begins a conversation.\"{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=227}} Court entertainments were open; anyone who could afford the clothing to attend functions was simply asked to sign the visitor's book.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=228}} Louise's first state ball was given on 19 February 1879, and she made a good impression on her guests when she ordered the silk cordon, separating the viceregal party from the guests, be removed. However, the ball was marred by various mishaps, including a drunken bandsman nearly starting a fire by pulling a curtain over a gas lamp.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=228}} The open house practice was criticised by guests who complained about the low social status of other guests. One attendee was horrified to find the attendee's grocer dancing in the same set.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=228}}\n\n[[File:Opening of Canadian Parliament 1879.gif|thumb|The Marquess of Lorne, accompanied by Princess Louise, opening the Canadian Parliament in 1879]]\nLouise and Lorne founded the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]], and enjoyed visiting [[Quebec]] (where they made their summer home), and [[Toronto]].

The horses then panicked, and dragged the overturned carriage over more than {{convert|400|yd|m}} of ground.

As it was, one [[Member of Parliament]] wrote: \"Except the cut in the lower part of the ear I think there was no injury done worth mentioning.\"{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=238}} Therefore, when Louise cancelled her immediate engagements, people thought she was [[malingering]].

In 1883, for reasons of her fragile health, she spent the winter in Bermuda, popularising a trend for wealthy North Americans to escape to Bermuda's relatively mild climate during the winter months. Her visit brought such attention to Bermuda that a palatial hotel, which opened in 1885, intended to cater to these new visitors, was named after her; [[The Fairmont Hamilton Princess|the Princess Hotel]] was built on the shore of [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], in the parish of [[Pembroke, Bermuda|Pembroke]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60915F9395F15738DDDA10A94D9405B8384F0D3] THE CAPITAL OF BERMUDA; HAMILTON, \"THE WHITEST CITY IN THE WORLD.\" A TOWN WHERE EVERY ROOF IS WHITE WASHED AND EVERY STREET AS CLEAN AS A FLOOR.

Louise, who had a jealous nature, had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity on account of the Queen's constant need for her.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=198}} Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=199}} Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Victoria's Daughters|last = Packard|first = Jerrold|publisher = St Martin's Griffin|year = 1998|isbn = |location = NY|pages = 205\u20137}}</ref> Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual relationship with her popular husband, which Louise was not.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=315}} Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=198}} Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: \"he [Henry] was almost the greatest friend I had\u2014I, too, miss him more than I can say\".{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=198}} In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant nothing to him.{{sfn|Lutyens|1961|p=52}}\n\n===Rumours regarding Louise===\nFurther rumours spread that Louise was having an affair with [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Arthur Bigge]], later [[Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]], the Queen's [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|assistant private secretary]]. Beatrice mentioned the rumours to the Queen's physician, calling it a \"scandal\",{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=199}} and Prince Henry claimed to have seen Bigge drinking to Louise's health at dinner.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=199}} Louise denied the rumour, claiming that it was started by Beatrice and Helena to undermine her position at court.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=201}} However, on Henry's death, relations between the sisters sporadically improved, and it was Louise, rather than the Queen, who was the first to arrive at [[Cimiez]] to be with the widowed Beatrice.{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=200}} Nevertheless, Louise's jealousy did not evaporate completely. James Reid, the Queen's [[physician]], wrote to his wife a few years later: \"Louise is as usual much down on her sisters. Hope she won't stay long or she will do mischief!\"<ref>Reid, p. 208</ref>\n\nRumours of affairs did not surround only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor [[Joseph Edgar Boehm]] died in Louise's presence at his studio in [[London]], leading to rumours that the two were having an affair.{{sfn|Stocker 2004, Louise, Princess, duchess of Argyll}} Boehm's assistant, [[Alfred Gilbert]], who played a central role in comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers,{{sfn|Stocker 2004, (Joseph) Edgar Boehm}} was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor.{{sfn|Stocker 2004, (Joseph) Edgar Boehm}} Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist [[Edwin Lutyens]]; her [[equerry]], Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=321}} However, [[Jehanne Wake]], Louise's biographer, argues that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=321}}\n\nDuring Victoria's last years, Louise carried out a range of public duties, such as opening public buildings, laying foundation stones, and officiating at special programmes. Louise, like her eldest sister [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], was more liberally minded, and supported the [[suffragist]] movement, completely contrary to the Queen's views.{{sfn|McDougall 1988, Later years (1883\u20131939)}} Louise privately visited Britain's first female doctor, [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson|Elizabeth Garrett]].{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=98}} Queen Victoria deplored the idea of women joining professions, especially the medical profession, and described the training of female doctors as a \"repulsive subject\".{{sfn|Longford|1987|p=395}}\n\n===Louise as unconventional royal===\n[[File:Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll c. 1900 by [[William James Topley]]]]\nLouise was determined to be seen as an ordinary person and not as a member of the court. When travelling abroad, she often used the alias \"Mrs Campbell\".{{sfn|McDougall 1988, Later years (1883\u20131939)}} Louise was known for her charity towards servants. On one occasion, the butler approached her and requested permission to dismiss the second footman, who was late getting out of bed. When she advised that the footman be given an alarm clock, the butler informed her that he already had one. She then went so far as to suggest a bed that would throw him out at a specified time, but she was told this was not feasible. Finally, she suggested that he might be ill, and when checked, he was found to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. The footman was therefore sent to [[New Zealand]] to recover.{{sfn|McDougall 1988, Later years (1883\u20131939)}}\n\nOn another occasion, when she visited [[Bermuda]], she was invited to a reception and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy for a glass of water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: \"Well take a good look at me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges.\"{{sfn|Wake|1988|pp=258\u2013259}} The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=259}}\n\nLouise and her sisters had another disagreement after the death of the Queen's close friend, [[Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill]]. Determined not to put her mother through more misery, Louise wanted the news to be broken to the Queen gradually. When this was not done, Louise voiced her sharp criticism of Helena and Beatrice.{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=70}} One month later, on 22 January 1901, Queen Victoria died at [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].{{sfn|Longford|1987|pp=561\u2013562}} In her will, the Queen bequeathed Kent House, on the Osborne Estate, to Louise as a country residence,{{sfn|Dennison|2007|p=226}} and gave Osborne Cottage to Louise's youngest sister, Beatrice. Louise and Beatrice were now neighbours both at Kensington Palace and Osborne.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=346}}\n\n==Later life==\n\n===Edwardian period===\nUpon Queen Victoria's death, Louise entered the social circle of her brother, the new [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], with whom she had much in common, including smoking.{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=74}} She had an obsession with physical fitness, and if she was sneered at for this, she would retort by saying: \"Never mind, I'll outlive you all.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Longford|1991|p=74}}</ref> Meanwhile, Louise's husband, 9th Duke of Argyll since 1900, took his seat in the [[House of Lords]]. The Colonial Secretary, [[Joseph Chamberlain]], offered him the office of [[Governor-General of Australia]] that year, but the offer was declined.{{sfn|Waite|2000}} Louise continued her sculpture, and in 1902, designed a memorial to the colonial soldiers who died in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=73}} In the same year, she began a nude study on a married woman suggested by the English painter Sir [[William Blake Richmond]].{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=73}}\n\nLouise spent much of her time at Kent House, and she frequently visited Scotland with her husband. Financial pressures did not disappear when Lorne became Duke, and Louise avoided inviting the King to [[Inveraray]], Argyll's ancestral home, because the couple were economising. When Queen Victoria had visited the house before Lorne became Duke of Argyll, there were seventy servants and seventy-four dogs.{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=74}} By the time of Edward VII's accession, there were four servants and two dogs.{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=74}}\n\nThe Duke of Argyll's health continued to deteriorate. He became increasingly [[senile]], and Louise nursed him devotedly from 1911. In these years Louise and her husband were closer than they had been before.{{sfn|Stocker 2004, Louise, Princess, duchess of Argyll}} In spring 1914 Louise stayed at [[Kensington Palace]] while her husband remained on the [[Isle of Wight]].\n\nHe developed bronchial problems followed by double [[pneumonia]]. Louise was summoned on 28 April 1914, and he died on 2 May.{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=77}} Following his death, Louise had a [[nervous breakdown]] and suffered from intense loneliness, writing to a friend shortly afterwards: \"My loneliness without the Duke is quite terrible. I wonder what he does now!\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Longford|1991|p=77}}</ref>\n\n===Last years===\nLouise spent her last years at [[Kensington Palace]], occupying rooms next to her sister [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]]. She made occasional public appearances with the royal family, such as at the [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|Cenotaph]] at [[Whitehall]] on 11 November 1925. However, her health deteriorated. In 1935, she greeted her nephew, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], and his wife, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], at Kensington Town Hall during their Silver Jubilee celebrations, and was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Kensington. Her last public appearance occurred in 1937, at the Home Arts and Industries Exhibition. Between these occasions, her great nephew, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]], abdicated on 11 December 1936. In December 1936, Louise wrote to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]], sympathising with him about the crisis.{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=306}}\n[[File:Princess Louise's grave at Frogmore.jpg|thumb|Princess Louise's grave (centre) at the [[Royal Burial Ground]] at [[Frogmore]]]]\n\nFollowing the accession of Edward's brother [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], she became too ill to move around, and was confined to Kensington Palace, affectionately called the \"Auntie Palace\" by [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=80}} She developed [[neuritis]] in her arm, inflammation of the nerves between the ribs, fainting fits, and [[sciatica]]. Louise occupied herself by drafting prayers, one of which was sent to [[Neville Chamberlain]], reading \"Guide our Ministers of State and all who are in authority over us ... \"{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=81}}\n\n==Death==\nShe died at Kensington Palace on the morning of 3 December 1939 at the age of 91 years, 8 months and 15 days, the same age to the day as her younger brother Prince Arthur,<ref name=\"London Gazette 1 December 1939\"/> wearing the wedding veil she had worn almost 70 years earlier.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=413}} Following a simple funeral, owing to the war, her remains  were [[cremation|cremated]] at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] on 8 December.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=412}} Her ashes were quietly placed in the Royal Crypt at St. George's Chapel on 12 December, with many members of the Royal and Argyll families present.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=412}} Her ashes were moved to the [[Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore]] near Windsor, on 13 March 1940.{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=83}} Louise's [[Will (law)|will]] stated that if she died in [[Scotland]] she should be buried at the [[Campbell mausoleum]] in [[Kilmun]] next to her husband; if in England, at [[Frogmore]] near her parents.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=412}} Her coffin was borne by eight NCOs of her own regiment, [[The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]].<ref>[[The Glasgow Herald]], 13 December 1939, p. 9</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Victoria statue Kensington.jpg|thumb|Louise's statue of Queen Victoria at Kensington Palace]]\nLouise bestowed her name on four Canadian regiments: [[The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)]] in Hamilton, Ontario; the [[Princess Louise Dragoon Guards]] in Ottawa, Ontario (inactive since 1965); the [[8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's)]] in [[Moncton]], New Brunswick; and the [[Princess Louise Fusiliers]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II later recalled that Louise and her sister [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Beatrice]] would talk until they stunned their audience with their output of words.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=410}}\n\nThe province of [[Alberta]] in [[Canada]] is named after her. Although the name \"Louise\" was originally planned, the Princess wished to honour her dead father, so her last name was chosen. [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]] in Alberta is also named after her, as is [[Mount Alberta]]. Although her time in Canada was not always happy, she liked the Canadian people and retained close links with her Canadian regiments.{{sfn|Stocker 2004, Louise, Princess, duchess of Argyll}} Back at home, she gained a reputation for paying unscheduled visits to hospitals, especially during her later years.{{sfn|Stocker 2004, Louise, Princess, duchess of Argyll}} Her relationship with her family was generally close. Although at times she bickered with the Queen, and her sisters Helena and Beatrice, the relations did not remain strained for long. She retained a lifelong correspondence with her brother, [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur]], and was one of King Edward VII's favourite sisters.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=350}} Of all her siblings, she was closest to [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Prince Leopold]], later [[Duke of Albany]], and she was devastated by his death in 1884.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=269}}\n\nAmong the younger generations of the family, Louise's favourite relatives were [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|the Duke]] and [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]].{{sfn|Longford|1991|p=80}} At the coronation of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] in 1937, Louise lent the Duchess the [[train (clothing)|train]] that she designed and wore for the [[coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra]] in 1902.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=411}}\n\nA war hospital in [[Erskine]], Scotland, is named after Louise. It took her name as she was the first [[patron]] of the unit. It was originally called [[Erskine (charity)|''Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers'']]. The name changed over the years to ''Erskine Hospital'' and then just ''Erskine''. The charity is close to its centenary year and has grown to become the biggest ex-service establishment in the country.\n\n=== Art Practice ===\nLouise had artistic training from childhood, first with [[Susan Durant]] from 1864, then [[Mary Thornycroft]] from 1867, and further lessons with [[Joseph Edgar Boehm|Edgar Boehm]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Modern Scottish Women Painters & Sculptors 1885-1965|last=Strang|first=Alice|publisher=National Galleries of Scotland|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=66-7}}</ref> She also then attended [[Royal College of Art|National Art Training School]], or NATS, which marks the first time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution. Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise had to make do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists. There was no training from the nude model, as there was for male art students. \n\nLouise held an account with the London artists\u2019 colourman Charles Roberson & Co. from April 1872 until February 1931, buying materials for oil and water colour painting including numerous sketchbooks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/archives/roberson|title=Charles Roberson & Co \u2014 Hamilton Kerr Institute|last=|website=www.hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2016-05-25}}</ref> \n\nLouise was the most artistically talented of Queen Victoria's daughters. As well as being an able actress, pianist and dancer, she was a prolific artist and sculptor. When Louise sculpted a statue of the Queen, portraying her in Coronation robes, the press claimed that her tutor, [[Joseph Edgar Boehm|Sir Edgar Boehm]], was the true creator of the work. The claim was denied by Louise's friends, who asserted her effort and independence.{{sfn|Wake|1988|p=302}} The work was intended to be exhibited in 1887, but production was delayed until 1893. A memorial to her brother-in-law, [[Prince Henry of Battenberg]], and a memorial to the Colonial soldiers who fell during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], reside at [[Whippingham]] Church on the [[Isle of Wight]], and another statue of Queen Victoria remains at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]].{{sfn|Stocker 2004, Louise, Princess, duchess of Argyll}} \n\n==== Selected Works of Art ====\n\n===== Works on Paper =====\n\n* ''Queen Victoria'', 1881.

While she was well known for her fiction during her lifetime, her long-term significance rests on her botanical work.<ref name = \"ANBG\">Australian National Botanical Gardens</ref> She is regarded as a ground-breaker for Australian women in journalism and natural science, and is significant in her time for her sympathetic references to Australian Aborigines in her writings and her encouragement of conservation.\n\n==Life==\n\nLouisa, as she was generally known, was born on her parents' property \"Oldbury\", Sutton Forest, about three miles from Berrima, New South Wales, and was their fourth child. Her father, James Atkinson, was the author of an early Australian book, ''An Account of the State of Agriculture and Grazing in New South Wales'', published in 1826. He died in 1834, when Louisa was only 8 weeks old.<ref name = \"JSNWL\">Jessie Street National Women's Library (2004)</ref> Louisa was a somewhat frail child with a heart defect, and so was educated by her mother, [[Charlotte Barton]], herself the author of Australia's first children's book, ''A Mother's Offering to her Children''.\n\nHer mother remarried, but this second husband, George Barton, a family friend, \"became violently and irrevocably insane not long after the marriage\"<ref name = \"Lawson\">Lawson (1988) p. 69, 73, 79, 74, 75, 76, 71, 81, 72</ref> resulting in the family needing to leave \"Oldbury\".\n\nShe lived most of her life in [[Kurrajong, New South Wales|Kurrajong Heights]] in a home called ''Fernhurst'' that was built by her mother.<ref name = \"Birkett\">Birkett (1938) p. 123, 123\u20134</ref> Prior to that she had lived briefly in [[Shoalhaven]] and Sydney.<ref name = \"JSNWL\"/> She became an active member of the community, operating as an unpaid scribe for the unlettered people of the district, a confidante of children, and a helper of the old and the sick. She also organised and taught in the district's first Sunday School.<ref name = \"Birkett\"/>\n.\nLouisa and her mother returned to \"Oldbury\" in 1865, with her mother dying there in 1868.<ref name = \"Clarke43\">Clarke (1988) p. 43</ref> On 11 March 1869, she married [[James Snowden Calvert]] (1825\u201384), a survivor of [[Ludwig Leichhardt|Leichhardt]]'s expedition of 1844\u20135 and also interested in botany.<ref name = \"Chisholm\">Chisholm (1969)</ref> He was, at the time, manager of Cavan station at Wee Jasper near [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]].<ref name = \"Clarke43\"/> She died at Swanton, near \"Oldbury\", in 1872, 18 days after the birth of her daughter, Louise Snowden Annie. She was buried in the Atkinson family vault at All Saints' Church, Sutton Forest. Her obituary in the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' described her as: \"This excellent lady, who has been cut down like a flower in the midst of her days, was highly distinguished for her literary and artistic attainments, as well as for the Christian principles and expansive charity which marked her career\".<ref>cited by Clarke (1988) p. 43-44</ref>\n\nAccording to Chisholm, she is also credited with being \"something of a pioneer in dress reform: the long skirts of the period were simply a nuisance in scrubby areas and so this woman used, both when rambling and pony riding, attire [trousers] which is said to have aroused 'some twitterings in the ranks of the colonial Mrs Grundy'.\"<ref name = \"Chisholm\"/> Clarke writes that she was joined in this behaviour by Mrs Selkirk, a local doctor's wife.<ref name = \"Clarke40\">Clarke (1988) p. 40</ref>\n[[File:Louisa Atkinson00.jpg|thumb|<center>'''''Cowanda'''''</center>]]\n[[File:Louisa Atkinson04.jpg|thumb|<center>'''''The Possum'''''</center>]]\n[[File:Louisa Atkinson02.jpg|thumb|<center>'''''Sandpipers'''''</center>]]\n\n==Botanist, naturalist and artist==\n\nLouisa is acknowledged as a leading botanist who discovered new plant species in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] and Southern Highlands region of New South Wales, and she championed the cause of conservation during a period of rapid land-clearing. Her botanical interest is, in part, credited to her home-schooling by her mother who was herself artistic and interested in natural history.<ref name = \"Chisholm\"/>\n\nShe undertook botanical excursions in areas remote from where she lived, such as the [[Illawarra]], but she became particularly well informed on the flora in Kurrajong and environs, such as the [[Grose Valley]], [[Mt Tomah]] and [[Springwood, New South Wales|Springwood]], where she spent much of her life. She collected specimens extensively for Rev. Dr. William Woolls, a well-known teacher and amateur botanist, and [[Ferdinand von Mueller]].<ref name = \"ANBG\"/> Lawson writes that von Mueller's work was aided by many amateur naturalists in Australia, but that Atkinson's contribution is worthy of particular note \"for the quality of its information, its scholarly commitment, its enthusiasm and persistence over time, its geographical range, its local depth, its robustness and liveliness of descriptive record, its sense of primary exploration, its sheer inventiveness\".<ref name = \"Lawson\"/> She is commemorated in the Loranthaceous genus ''Atkinsonia'', and in the species ''Erechtites atkinsoniae'', ''Epacris calvertiana'', ''Helichrysum calvertiana'', ''Xanthosia atkinsoniana'' and ''Doodia atkinsonii''.\n\nBy the 1860s Atkinson was becoming aware of the impact of European agriculture on native flora. She wrote about this on several occasions, making such statements as \"It needs no fertile imagination to foresee that in, say, half-a-century's time, tracts of hundreds of miles will be treeless\".<ref name = \"Lawson\"/>\n\nShe is also well regarded as a [[botanical artist]], was interested in zoology and was a competent taxidermist.<ref name = \"ANBG\"/>\nHer botanical art was unusual for its diversity: it included animals, birds, insects, reptiles and landscapes.<ref name = \"LawsonNSWSL\">Lawson (1995) p. 10</ref>\n\nShe popularised science and wrote for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and the ''Horticultural Magazine''.\n\n==Writer==\n\nIn another claim to fame, Louisa is credited as the first Australian-born woman to have a novel published in Australia, ''Gertrude the Emigrant'' (1857), for which she used the name \"An Australian woman\". She was 23 years old.<ref>Maguire, M., 'Atkinson, (Caroline) Louisa Waring', in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds), ''Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens'', South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 35.</ref> Contemporary critic, G. B. Barton, described the novel as follows: \"The scene is laid wholly in the Colony, principally in the bush; and nowhere are the peculiar features of bush life more accurately or graphically pourtrayed (sic). The tale abounds in incident, the characters are skilfully drawn, and the literary execution is quite equal to that of ordinary novels\".<ref>cited by Clarke (1988) p. 41 & 43</ref>\n\nShe was also the first author to illustrate her own work.<ref name = \"JSNWL\"/> Her second novel, ''Cowanda, The Veteran's Grant'' (1859) had a cover design by colonial artist [[S. T. Gill]].<ref name = \"Clarke43\"/> Various other stories by her were serialised in ''[[The Sydney Mail]]''. She was deeply religious and her fiction, which can generally be described as \"Victorian romance-melodrama\",<ref name = \"Lawson\"/> conveyed simple moral messages through \"intrusive explicit moralising\".<ref name = \"Lawson\"/> Despite this, her novels are significant because \"they are the first novels written by a native-born Australian woman; they offer, however roughly, a vigorously sustained depiction of Australian colonial life; and they offer a particular colonial, female perspective actively attempting to modify imported English values\".<ref name = \"Lawson\"/> Lawson also argues that, through her personal experience, Atkinson is able to record in her fiction \"a female perspective on an infant white Australia, both in its rushed ''ad hoc'' urban development and its equally ''ad hoc'' muddled pastoral growth\".<ref name = \"Lawson\"/> The Jessie Street National Women's Library states that her work is important for promoting the rights of women and children<ref name = \"JSNWL\"/> and, in fact, Lawson suggests that \"it is possible to see Atkison as our first true humanist-democrat in fiction since she addresses the same observant analysis and compassion to white and black characters and to women as well as men\".<ref name = \"Lawson\"/>\n\nIn addition to fiction, Atkinson also wrote natural science articles, and was 19 when, in 1853, the ''Illustrated Sydney News'' published her first illustrated articles, ''Nature Notes of the Month with Illustrations''. She was the first woman in Australia to have a long-running series of articles published in a major newspaper.<ref name = \"JSNWL\"/> This was a series of natural history sketches titled \"A Voice from the Country\". They appeared in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and the ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' from 1860-03-01 and ran for over 10 years.<ref name = \"Clarke40\"/> They were \"simply informative and popularising\" with a \"straightforward educational tone and intention\".<ref name = \"Lawson\"/> An editorial note attached to the posthumous publication of her last story, ''Tessa's Resolve'', states that these articles \"are looked upon somewhat as authorities in matters relating to Australian natural history and botany\".<ref>cited by Clarke (1988) p. 44</ref>\n\nUsing the signature 'LA', becoming 'LC' in 1869, her illustrated, but more scientific, articles on flora and fauna were published in the ''Horticultural Magazine'' from 1864 to 1870.<ref>Lawson (1994) p.47</ref><ref name = \"Clarke41\">Clarke (1988) p. 41</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Australian botanical illustrators]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Gertrude the Emigrant: A Tale of Colonial Life by an Australian Lady'' (1857)\n*''Cowanda: The Veteran's Grant: an Australian Story by the Author of Gertrude'' (1859)\n*''Debatable Ground of the Carlillawarra Claimants'' (serialised in ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'', 30 March 1861 \u2013 7 September 1861)\n*''Myra'' (serialised in the ''Sydney Mail'', 27 February 1864 \u2013 23 April 1864)\n*''Tom Hellicar's Children'' (serialised in the ''Sydney Mail'', 4 March 1871)\n*''Bush Home'' (serialised in the ''Sydney Mail'')\n*''Tressa's Resolve'' (serialised in the ''Sydney Mail'', 31 August 1872 \u2013 7 December 1872)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Adelaide, Debra (1988) ''Australian Women Writers: A Bibliographic Guide'', London, Pandora\n*[http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/atkinson-louisa.html Australian National Botanic Gardens ''Atkinson, Caroline Louisa Waring (1834\u20131872)]'\n*Birkett, Winifred (1938) \"Some pioneer women writers\" in Eldershaw, Flora (ed.)

She is best known for her detailed interior scenes, communicated with rich colors and moody lighting. \n<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Harriet_Backer/utdypning ''Harriet Backer'' (Store norske leksikon)]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Harriet Backer - Blue Interior - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left||''Blue Interior'']]\nBacker was born to an affluent family in [[Holmestrand]] in [[Vestfold]] county, Norway.  At 12, she moved with her family to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now [[Oslo]]) where she took lessons in [[drawing]] and [[painting]], notably with [[Joachim Calmeyer]].  She studied with [[Johan Fredrik Eckersberg]] (1861\u201365) and with Norwegian theologian and artist [[Christen Brun]] (1828-1917)  and attended the painting school of [[Knud Bergslien]] (1871\u201374). Later, she was a student of [[Eilif Peterssen]] and [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]]. She studied in [[Munich]] (1874-1878) and was associated with Madame Tr\u00e9lat's  art school in [[Paris]]. Backer lived in Paris (1878-1888).\nShe traveled extensively throughout Europe as a companion to her sister, the pianist [[Agathe Backer-Gr\u00f8ndahl]], and she took further lessons in the course of these trips.  She studied in [[Paris]] and [[Munich]], and was influenced by [[impressionism]], though her work is mostly classified as [[Realism (arts)|realist]]. She never belonged to any school but her work is often compared with that of her friend [[Eilif Peterssen]]. Harriet Backer worked in the tradition of realism in painting, where she is regarded as both a [[Naturalist school of painting|naturalist]] and an early [[Impressionist]]. From 1889-1912, she operated an art school and was an influence on a number of younger artists including  [[Marie Hauge]], [[Lars Jorde]] and [[Henrik Lund (painter)|Henrik Lund]]. She also gave art lessons to the novelist [[Cora Sandel]].\n\nHarriet Backer won a silver medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]] and received the King's Medal of Merit in Gold (''Kongens fortjenstmedalje i gull'') in 1908.

In the collection of the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]]]]\n\n'''Alice Bailly''' (25 February 1872 \u2013 1 January 1938) was a radical [[Switzerland|Swiss]] painter, known for her interpretations on [[cubism]], [[fauvism]], her wool paintings, and her participation in the [[Dada]] movement. In 1906, Bailly had settled in [[Paris]] where she befriended [[Juan Gris]], [[Francis Picabia]], and [[Marie Laurencin]], avant-garde [[modernist]] painters who influenced her works and her later life.<ref name=\"nmwa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://nmwa.org/explore/artist-profiles/alice-bailly|title=Alice Bailly|work=nmwa.org}}</ref>\n\n==Education and Early Career==\nBailly was born in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], where she attended the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and took women's-only courses. During her time there she studied under Hugues Bovy and Denise Sarkiss.  She later studied in [[Munich, Germany]].  By 1904 she had moved to Paris,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Gillian|title=Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-garde: Modernism and Feminine Art, 1900 to the Late 1920s|date=1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719041655|page=16}}</ref> where she befriended a number of notable modernist painters such as [[Juan Gris]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], Sonia Lewitska and [[Marie Laurencin]].\n\n==Inspiration and Fauvism==\nWhile in Paris exhibiting her wood engravings, she became interested in [[Fauvism]]. What drew Bailly to fauvism was the \"style's bold use of intense colors, dark outlines, and emphatically unrealistic anatomy and space.\" Her paintings in this style were eventually shown in the Salon d'Automne in 1908 along with many other distinguished Fauv painters.<ref name=\"nmwa.org\"/>\n\n==Cubism and Wool Paintings==\nIn 1912, Bailly's work was chosen to represent Swiss artists in an exhibit that traveled through [[Russia]], [[England]], and [[Spain]].<ref name=\"nmwa.org\"/> At the start of [[World War I]], Bailly returned to her native country of [[Switzerland]] and invented her signature \"wool paintings,\" which were her own variations of [[Cubism]]. The style consisted of short strands of colored yarn that acted as brush strokes.  She made about 50 of these wool paintings between 1913 and 1922.\n\n==Dada Movement==\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[Dada]] phenomenon came about, of which Bailly was briefly involved with. The movement, beginning in Switzerland, consisted of a variety of art forms and aimed to provoke violent reactions out of its viewers, not to please the public eye. Many believe modern performance art was developed because of this movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/history.htm|title=History - The International Dada Archive - The University of Iowa|work=uiowa.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Participation in the ''Salon de Independents''==\nThe ''Salon de Independents'' was established in 1884 for artists who did not meet traditional standards of artistic style at the time. The society was open to everyone and allowed female artists a venue to exhibit their works.  Alice Bailly was regularly exhibited in the society, along with many other female artists specializing in [[cubism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/women_at_the_easel/slides/1917_alice_bailly.html|title=Women at the Easel / Alice Bailly, 1917|work=earlywomenmasters.net}}</ref>\n\n==Famous Works==\nBailly's most famous work is said to be her painting titled \"Self Portrait,\" painted in 1917. The painting represents a more avant-garde approach to self-portraits than was normally accepted at her time. The painting incorporates many styles. Her three-quarter-turned pose indicates a traditional self-portrait, while the red, orange and blue hues show Fauve influences.  When looking at her arms and hands, the arching lines represent the influence of Italian Futurist art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nmwa.org/works/self-portrait|title=Self-Portrait  - National Museum of Women in the Arts|work=nmwa.org}}</ref>\n\nSome of her other notable works include \"At the Ball\" (1927), \"The Battle of Tolochenaz\" (1916), \"Geneva Harbor\" (1915), \"Landscape at Orsay\" (1912), and \"Vacation\" (1922).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-athenaeum.org/art/list.php?m=a&s=tu&aid=2283|title=Alice Bailly - Artworks|work=the-athenaeum.org}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1923 she moved to [[Lausanne]] and remained there until her death. In 1936, the Theatre of Lausanne commissioned her to paint eight large murals for the foyer.  This daunting task led to the exhaustion which many speculate contributed to her death in 1938 of [[tuberculosis]].  In her will, she established a trust fund to aid young Swiss artists with the money made through the sale of her art.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Commons category|Alice Bailly}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=J.|title=Alice Bailly, Cubo-Futurist Pioneer (1872\u20131938)|journal=Oxford Art Journal|date=1980|volume=3|issue=1|pages=52\u201357|doi=10.1093/oxartj/3.1.52}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Fauvism}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bailly, Alice}}\n[[Category:1872 births]]\n[[Category:1938 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Geneva]]\n[[Category:19th-century Swiss painters]]\n[[Category:20th-century Swiss painters]]\n[[Category:20th-century deaths from tuberculosis]]\n[[Category:Swiss women artists]]\n[[Category:Muralists]]\n[[Category:20th-century women artists]]\n[[Category:19th-century women artists]]\n[[Category:Women muralists]]"}]},"46252265":{"pageid":46252265,"ns":0,"title":"Elizabeth Gowdy Baker"},"5472145":{"pageid":5472145,"ns":0,"title":"Mary Baker"},"46252086":{"pageid":46252086,"ns":0,"title":"Edith Ella Baldwin"},"46251737":{"pageid":46251737,"ns":0,"title":"Caroline Peddle Ball"},"15381000":{"pageid":15381000,"ns":0,"title":"Bessie Bamber"},"37384258":{"pageid":37384258,"ns":0,"title":"Mary Elizabeth Barber"},"41813643":{"pageid":41813643,"ns":0,"title":"Maria Geertruida Barbiers"},"34744074":{"pageid":34744074,"ns":0,"title":"Eliza Barchus"},"15927713":{"pageid":15927713,"ns":0,"title":"Magdalene B\u00e4rens"},"7497270":{"pageid":7497270,"ns":0,"title":"Alice Pike Barney"},"42343533":{"pageid":42343533,"ns":0,"title":"Annie Gardner Barr"},"32654400":{"pageid":32654400,"ns":0,"title":"Ann Charlotte Bartholomew"},"46382900":{"pageid":46382900,"ns":0,"title":"Jane E.

Educated privately and with early musical talent, she lost her chance at a career as a singer when illness destroyed her voice. She then determined on becoming an artist, and she studied painting in [[France]] at the [[Tony Robert-Fleury|Robert-Fleury]] studio and at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]].<ref name=\"eb\"/><ref name=\"sr\"/> The Acad\u00e9mie, as one of the few establishments that accepted female students, attracted young women from all over Europe and the United States. Fellow students at the Acad\u00e9mie included [[Anna Bili\u0144ska-Bohdanowicz]]owa and especially [[Louise Breslau]], whom Bashkirtseff viewed as her only real rival.<ref name=\"sr\"/> Bashkirtseff would go on to produce a remarkable, if fairly conventional, body of work in her short lifetime, exhibiting at the Paris Salon as early as 1880 and every year thereafter until her death (except 1883). In 1884, she exhibited a portrait of [[Paris]] slum children entitled ''The Meeting'' and a pastel portrait of her cousin, for which she received an honorable mention.<ref name=\"eb11\"/>\n\nBashkirtseff's best-known works are ''The Meeting'' (now in the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris]]) and ''In the Studio'', (shown here) a portrait of her fellow artists at work. Although a large number of Bashkirtseff's works were destroyed by the [[Nazi]]s during [[World War II]], at least 60 survive. In 2000, a U.S. touring exhibition entitled \"Overcoming All the Obstacles: The Women of Academy Julian\" featured works by Bashkirtseff and her schoolmates.<ref name=\"homage\"/>\n\n[[File:Bashkirtseff - In the Studio.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Studio'' by Marie Bashkirtseff (1881); Marie Bashkirtseff is the central figure seated in the foreground]]\n\nAs a painter, Bashkirtseff took her cue from her friend [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]]'s admiration for [[Realism art movement|realism]] and [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]]. Where Bastien-Lepage had found his inspiration in nature, Bashkirtseff turned to the urban scene, writing, \"I say nothing of the fields because Bastien-Lepage reigns over them as a sovereign; but the streets, however, have not yet had their... Bastien.\"<ref name=\"diary\"/> By unlucky chance, both artists succumbed prematurely to chronic illness in the same year, and the later pages of Bashkirtseff's journal record her visits to the dying painter.\n\nDying of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 25, Bashkirtseff lived just long enough to emerge as an intellectual in Paris in the 1880s. A [[misandry]]st, she wrote several articles for [[Hubertine Auclert]]'s mysandrist newspaper ''[[La Citoyenne]]'' in 1881 under the [[nom de plume]] \"Pauline Orrel.\" One of her most-quoted sayings is: \"Let us love dogs, let us love only dogs! Men and cats are unworthy creatures.\"\n\nBashkirtseff died in [[Paris]] in 1884, and she is buried in [[Cimeti\u00e8re de Passy]], Paris. Her monument is a full-sized artist's studio that has been declared a historic monument by the government of France.\n\n[[File:Bashkirtseff-grave.jpg|thumb|right|The grave of Marie Bashkirtseff]]\n\n==The diary==\nFrom approximately the age of 13, Bashkirtseff kept a journal, and probably, it is for this that she is most famous today. It has been called \"a strikingly modern psychological self-portrait of a young, gifted mind,\"<ref name=\"eb\"/> and her urgent prose, which occasionally breaks out into dialogue, remains extremely readable. She was multilingual and despite her self-involvement, was a keen observer with an acute ear for hypocrisy, so that her journal also offers a near-novelistic account of the late nineteenth century European [[bourgeoisie]]. A consistent theme throughout her journal is her deep desire to achieve fame, inflected by her increasing fear that her intermittent illnesses might turn out to be tuberculosis. In a prefatory section written toward the end of her life, in which she recounts her family history, she writes, \"If I do not die young I hope to live as great artist; but if I die young, I intend to have my journal, which cannot fail to be interesting, published. Similarly: \"When I am dead, my life, which appears to me a remarkable one, will be read. (The only thing wanting is that it should have been different).\"<ref name=\"diary\"/> In effect, the first half of Bashkirtseff's journal is a [[Bildungsroman|coming-of-age story]] while the second is an account of heroic suffering.<ref name=\"sw\"/>\n\nBashkirtseff's journal was first published in 1887, and was only the second diary by a woman published in France to that date. It was an immediate success, not least because its cosmopolitan confessional style was a marked departure from the contemplative, mystical diaries of the writer [[Eug\u00e9nie de Gu\u00e9rin]] that had been published in 1862.<ref name=\"sw\"/> An English translation appeared two years later under the title ''Marie Bashkirtseff: The Journal of a Young Artist 1860-1884''. Translated by Mary J. Serrano, it was heavily abridged and bowdlerized, her relatives seeing to it that a good deal of material they considered unflattering to the family was removed.\n\n[[File:Bashkirtseff.jpg|thumb|''Self-portrait with a Palette'', 1880]]\n\nBritish Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] referred to her journal as \"a book without a parallel,\",<ref name=\"weg\"/> and another early admirer was [[George Bernard Shaw]]. It remained popular, eventually spinning off both plays and movies based on her life story, including ''[[The Affairs of Maupassant]]'', directed by [[Henry Koster]] and released in the United States in 1938.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Her diary was cited as an inspiration by the American writer [[Mary MacLane]], whose own shockingly confessional diary was written a bare generation later, and it was mentioned as a model by later writers who became known for their diaries, including [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]], [[Katherine Mansfield]], and [[Anais Nin]].<ref name=\"sw\"/>\n\nHer letters, consisting of her correspondence with the writer [[Guy de Maupassant]] (which she had begun under an assumed name) were first published in 1891.<ref name=\"eb11\"/><ref name=\"homage\"/>\n\nUntil recently the accepted date of Bashkirtseff's birth was November 11 [Nov. 23, [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]], 1860. After the discovery of the original manuscript of Bashkirtseff\u2018s journal in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], however, it was found that her journal had been abridged and censored by her family in its first editions. Her date of birth (1858 not 1860) was falsified by her mother to make Bashkirtseff appear even more precocious. An unabridged edition of the complete journal, based on the original manuscript, has been published in French in 16 volumes, and excerpts from the years 1873&ndash;76 have been translated into English under the title ''I Am the Most Interesting Book of All'' (see editions listed below).\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Bashkirtseva Autimn.JPG|''Autumn'', 1883\nImage:Bashkirtseff - The Meeting.jpg|''The Meeting'', 1884\nImage:Marie Bashkirtseff - Der Regenschirm - 1883.jpeg|''The Umbrella'', 1883\nImage:Marie Bashkirtseff 2.jpg|''Spring'', ca. 1884\n</gallery>\n\n==Editions of the diary==\n*''The Journal of Marie Bashkirtseff: I Am the Most Interesting Book of All (Volume I) and Lust for Glory (Volume II)''.

Carter, ''Cecilia Beaux'', Rizzoli, New York, 2005, p. 11, ISBN 0-8478-2708-9</ref> He returned when Cecilia was two, but left four years later after his business failed. As she confessed later, \"We didn\u2019t love Papa very much, he was so foreign.  We thought him ''peculiar''.\" Her father did have a natural aptitude for drawing and the sisters were charmed by his whimsical sketches of animals. Later, Beaux would discover that her French heritage would serve her well during her pilgrimage and training in France.<ref>Carter, p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File:Cecilia Beaux self-portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Self-portrait]] by Beaux, 1894]]\n\nIn Philadelphia, Beaux's aunt Emily married mining engineer William Foster Biddle, whom Beaux would later describe as \"after my grandmother, the strongest and most beneficent influence in my life.\" For fifty years, he cared for his nieces-in-law with consistent attention and occasional financial support.<ref>Carter, p. 18</ref> Her grandmother, on the other hand, provided day-to-day supervision and kindly discipline. Whether with housework, handiwork, or academics, Grandma Leavitt offered a pragmatic framework, stressing that \"everything undertaken must be completed, conquered.\" The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] years were particularly challenging, but the extended family survived despite little emotional or financial support from Beaux's father.<ref>Carter, p. 19</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Beaux began to spend some time in the household of \"Willie\" and Emily, both proficient musicians. Beaux learned to play the piano but preferred singing. The musical atmosphere later proved an advantage for her artistic ambitions. Beaux recalled, \"They understood perfectly the spirit and necessities of an artist's life.\"<ref>Carter, p. 20</ref> In her early teens, she had her first major exposure to art during visits with Willie to the nearby [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], one of America's foremost art schools and museums. Though fascinated by the narrative elements of some of the pictures, particularly the Biblical themes of the massive paintings of [[Benjamin West]], at this point Beaux had no aspirations of becoming an artist.<ref>Carter, p. 25</ref>\n\nHer childhood was a sheltered though generally happy one. As a teen she already manifested the traits, as she described, of \"both a realist and a perfectionist, pursued by an uncompromising passion for carrying through.\"<ref>Carter, p. 29</ref> She attended the Misses Lyman School and was just an average student, though she did well in French and Natural History. However, she was unable to afford the extra fee for art lessons.<ref>Carter, p. 31</ref> At age 16, Beaux began art lessons with a relative, [[Catherine A. Janvier|Catherine Ann Drinker]], an accomplished artist who had her own studio and a going clientele. Drinker became Beaux's role model, and she continued lessons with Drinker for a year. She then studied for two years with the painter Francis Adolf Van der Wielen, who offered lessons in perspective and drawing from casts during the time that the new [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] was under construction. Given the bias of the [[Victorian age]], female students were denied direct study in anatomy and could not attend drawing classes with live models (who were often prostitutes) until a decade later.<ref>Carter, p. 37</ref>\n\n[[File:New England Woman Cecilia Beaux.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''New England Woman''. Portrait of Mrs. Jedidiah H. Richards (Beaux's cousin Julia Leavitt), 1895. [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]]]]\n\nAt 18, Beaux was appointed as a drawing teacher at Miss Sanford's School, taking over Drinker's post. She also gave private art lessons and produced decorative art and small portraits. Her own studies were mostly self-directed. Beaux received her first introduction to [[lithography]] doing copy work for Philadelphia printer Thomas Sinclair and she published her first work in ''St. Nicholas'' magazine in December 1873.<ref>Carter, p. 45</ref> Beaux demonstrated accuracy and patience as a scientific illustrator, creating drawings of fossils for [[Edward Drinker Cope]], for a multi-volume report sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey. However, she did not find technical illustration suitable for a career (the extreme exactitude required gave her pains in the \"solar plexus\"). At this stage, she did not yet consider herself an artist.<ref>Beaux, pp. 77-80</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 48-49</ref>\n\nBeaux began attending the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1876, then under the dynamic influence of [[Thomas Eakins]], whose great work ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' had \"horrified Philadelphia Exhibition-goers as a gory spectacle\" at the [[Centennial Exhibition]] of 1876.<ref>Carter, p. 54</ref> She steered clear of the controversial Eakins, though she much admired his work. His progressive teaching philosophy, focused on anatomy and live study (and allowed the female students to partake in segregated studios), eventually led to his firing as director of the Academy. She did not ally herself with Eakins' ardent student supporters, and later wrote, \"A curious instinct of self-preservation kept me outside the magic circle.\"<ref>Carter, p. 59</ref> Instead, she attended costume and portrait painting classes for three years taught by the ailing director [[Christian Schussele]].<ref>Carter, p. 55</ref> Beaux won the [[Mary Smith Prize]] at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] exhibitions in 1885, 1887, 1891, and 1892.<ref name=\"Penn Academy\">{{cite book|author=Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts|title=Catalogue of the Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IqtNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA10|year=1914|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving the Academy, the 24-year-old Beaux decided to try her hand at [[porcelain painting]] and she enrolled in a course at the National Art Training School. She was well suited to the precise work but later wrote, \"this was the lowest depth I ever reached in commercial art, and although it was a period when youth and romance were in their first attendance on me, I remember it with gloom and record it with shame.\"<ref>Carter, p. 63</ref> She studied privately with [[William Sartain]], a friend of Eakins and a New York artist invited to Philadelphia to teach a group of art students, starting in 1881. Though Beaux admired Eakins more and thought his painting skill superior to Sartain's, she preferred the latter's gentle teaching style which promoted no particular aesthetic approach.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 65\">Carter, p. 65</ref> Unlike Eakins, however, Sartain believed in [[phrenology]] and Beaux adopted a lifelong belief that physical characteristics correlated with behaviors and traits.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 65\"/>\n\nBeaux attended Sartain's classes for two years, then rented her own studio and shared it with a group of women artists who hired a live model and continued without an instructor. After the group disbanded, Beaux set in earnest to prove her artistic abilities. She painted a large canvas in 1884, ''Les Derniers Jours d'Enfance'', a portrait of her sister and nephew whose composition and style revealed a debt to [[James McNeill Whistler]] and whose subject matter was akin to [[Mary Cassatt]]'s mother-and-child paintings.<ref>Carter, p. 67</ref> It was awarded a prize for the best painting by a female artist at the Academy, and further exhibited in Philadelphia and New York.  Following that seminal painting, she painted over 50 portraits in the next three years with the zeal of a committed professional artist. Her invitation to serve as a juror on the hanging committee of the Academy confirmed her acceptance amongst her peers.<ref>Carter, p. 69</ref> In the mid-1880s, she was receiving commissions from notable Philadelphians and earning $500 per portrait, comparable to what Eakins commanded.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 70\">Carter, p. 70</ref> When her friend Margaret Bush-Brown insisted that ''Les Derniers'' was good enough to be exhibited at the famed [[Paris Salon]], Beaux relented and sent the painting abroad in the care of her friend, who managed to get the painting into the exhibition.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 70\"/>\n\n[[File:Clemenceau Beaux 1920.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Georges Clemenceau]] by Cecilia Beaux (1920)]]\n\n===Paris===\nAt 32, despite her clear success in Philadelphia, Beaux decided that she still needed to advance her skills. She left for [[Paris]] with cousin May Whitlock, forsaking several suitors and overcoming the objections of her family. There she trained at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]], the largest art school in Paris, and at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]], receiving weekly critiques from established masters like [[Tony Robert-Fleury]] and [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]].<ref>Carter, p. 77</ref> She wrote, \"Fleury is much less benign than Bouguereau and don't temper his severities\u2026he hinted of possibilities before me and as he rose said the nicest thing of all, 'we will do all we can to help you'\u2026I want these men\u2026to know me and recognize that I can do something.\"<ref>Carter, p. 82</ref> Though advised regularly of Beaux's progress abroad and to \"not be worried about any indiscretions of ours\", her Aunt Eliza repeatedly reminded her niece to avoid the temptations of Paris, \"Remember you are first of all a Christian \u2013 then a woman and last of all an Artist.\"<ref>Carter, p. 84</ref>\n\nWhen Beaux arrived in Paris, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], a group of artists who had begun their own series of independent exhibitions from the official Salon in 1874, were beginning to lose their solidarity. Also known as the \"Independents\" or \"Intransigents\", the group which at times included [[Degas]], [[Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Caillebotte]], [[Pissarro]], [[Renoir]], and [[Berthe Morisot]], had been receiving the wrath of the critics for several years. Their art, though varying in style and technique, was the antithesis of the type of Academic art in which Beaux was trained and of which her teacher William-Adolphe Bouguereau was a leading master. In the summer of 1888, with classes in summer recess, Beaux worked in the fishing village of [[Concarneau]] with the American painters Alexander Harrison and Charles Lasar. She tried applying the plein-air painting techniques used by the Impressionists to her own landscapes and portraiture, with little success.<ref>Carter, p. 87</ref> Unlike her predecessor [[Mary Cassatt]], who had arrived near the beginning of the Impressionist movement 15 years earlier and who had absorbed it, Beaux's artistic temperament, precise and true to observation, would not align with Impressionism and she remained a realist painter for the rest of her career, even as [[C\u00e9zanne]], [[Matisse]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Picasso]] were beginning to take art into new directions.<ref>Carter, p. 91</ref> Beaux mostly admired classic artists like [[Titian]] and [[Rembrandt]]. Her European training did influence her palette, however, and she adopted more white and paler coloration in her oil painting, particularly in depicting female subjects, an approach favored by Sargent as well.<ref name=\"Columbus Museum of Art p.44\">{{citation |editor-last=Roberts |editor-first=Norma J. |title=The American Collections |publisher=[[Columbus Museum of Art]] |year=1988 |isbn=0-8109-1811-0 |page=44}}.</ref>\n\n===Return to Philadelphia===\n[[File:SarahAlliboneLeavitt.jpg|thumb|230px|''Sita and Sarita (Jeune Fille au Chat)''. Portrait of Sarah Allibone Leavitt, 1893&ndash;1894. Collection of the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\nBack in America in 1889, Beaux proceeded to paint portraits in the [[grand manner]], taking as her subjects members of her sister's family as well as the elite of Philadelphia. In making her decision to devote herself to art, she also thought it was best not to marry, and in choosing male company she selected men who would not threaten to sidetrack her career.<ref>Carter, p. 105</ref> She resumed life with her family, and they supported her fully, acknowledging her chosen path and demanding of her little in the way of household responsibilities, \"I was never once asked to do an errand in town, some bit of shopping\u2026so well did they understand.\"<ref>Carter, p. 106</ref> She developed a structured, professional routine, arriving promptly at her studio, and expected the same from her models.\n\nThe five years that followed were highly productive, resulting in over forty portraits.<ref>Carter, p. 107</ref> In 1890 she exhibited at the Paris Exposition, obtained in 1893 the gold medal of the [[Philadelphia Art Club]], and also the Dodge prize at the New York [[National Academy of Design]].<ref>Carter, p. 108</ref> Her portrait of ''The Reverend Matthew Blackburne Grier'' was particularly well-received, as was ''Sita and Sarita'', a portrait of her cousin Charles W. Leavitt's wife Sarah (Allibone) Leavitt in white, with a small black cat perched on her shoulder, both gazing out mysteriously. The mesmerizing effect prompted one critic to point out \"the witch-like weirdness of the black kitten\" and for many years, the painting solicited questions by the press. But the result was not pre-planned, as Beaux's sister later explained, \"Please make no mystery about it\u2014it was only an idea to put the black kitten on her cousin's shoulder. Nothing deeper.\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 114\">Carter, p. 114</ref> ''Sita and Sarita'' eventually was donated by the artist to the collection of the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]].<ref>Tappert, p. 32</ref> Another highly regarded portrait from that period is ''New England Woman'' (1895), a nearly all-white oil painting which was purchased by the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].\n\nIn 1895 Beaux became the first woman to have a regular teaching position at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she instructed in portrait drawing and painting for the next twenty years.<ref>Goodyear, p. 12</ref> That rare type of achievement by a woman prompted one local newspaper to state, \"It is a legitimate source of pride to Philadelphia that one of its most cherished institutions has made this innovation.\" She was a popular instructor.<ref name=\"Carter, p. 114\"/> In 1896, Beaux returned to France to see a group of her paintings presented at the Salon. Influential French critic M. Henri Rochefort commented, \"I am compelled to admit, not without some chagrin, that not one of our female artists\u2026is strong enough to compete with the lady who has given us this year the portrait of Dr. Grier.  Composition, flesh, texture, sound drawing\u2014everything is there without affectation, and without seeking for effect.\"<ref>Carter, p. 120</ref>\n\nCecelia Beaux considered herself a \"[[New Woman]]\", a 19th-century women who explored educational and career opportunities that had generally been denied to women. In the late 19th century [[Charles Dana Gibson]] depicted the \"New Woman\" in his painting, ''The Reason Dinner was Late'', which is \"a sympathetic portrayal of artistic aspiration on the part of young women\" as she paints a visiting policeman.<ref>Nancy Mowall Mathews.

All three aunts had died and she needed an emotional break from Philadelphia and New York. She managed to find new subjects for portraiture, working in the mornings and enjoying a leisurely life the rest of the time. She carefully regulated her energy and her activities to maintain a productive output, and considered that a key to her success. On why so few women succeeded in art as she did, she stated, \"Strength is the stumbling block. They (women) are sometimes unable to stand the hard work of it day in and day out.  They become tired and cannot reenergize themselves.\"<ref>Carter, p. 149</ref>\n\nWhile Beaux stuck to her portraits of the elite, American art was advancing into urban and social subject matter, led by artists such as [[Robert Henri]] who espoused a totally different aesthetic, \"Work with great speed..Have your energies alert, up and active. Do it all in one sitting if you can.  In one minute if you can.  There is no use delaying\u2026Stop studying water pitchers and bananas and paint everyday life.\" He advised his students, among them [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Rockwell Kent]], to live with the common man and paint the common man, in total opposition to Cecilia Beaux's artistic methods and subjects.<ref>Carter, p. 153</ref> The clash of Henri and [[William Merritt Chase]] (representing Beaux and the traditional art establishment) resulted in 1907 in the independent exhibition by the urban realists known as \"The Eight\" or the [[Ashcan School]]. Beaux and her art friends defended the old order, and many thought (and hoped) the new movement to be a passing fad, but it turned out to be a revolutionary turn in American art.\n\n[[File:William Henry Howell (painting, 1911).jpg|thumb|200px|Painting of [[William Henry Howell]] (1919)]]\n\nIn 1910, her beloved Uncle Willie died. Though devastated by the loss, at fifty-five years of age, Beaux remained highly productive. In the next five years she painted almost 25 percent of her lifetime output and received a steady stream of honors.<ref>Carter, p. 162</ref> She had a major exhibition of 35 paintings at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., in 1912. Despite her continuing production and accolades, however, Beaux was working against the current of tastes and trends in art. The famed \"Armory Show\" of 1913 in New York City was a landmark presentation of 1,200 paintings showcasing [[Modernism]]. Beaux believed that the public, initially of mixed opinion about the \"new\" art, would ultimately reject it and return its favor to the Pre-Impressionists.\n\nBeaux was crippled after breaking her hip while walking in Paris in 1924.  With her health impaired, her work output dwindled for the remainder of her life.<ref name=\"Columbus Museum of Art p.44\" /> That same year Beaux was asked to produce a self-portrait for the Medici collection in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.<ref>[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/index.cfm/fuseaction/Items.ViewImageDetails/ItemID/3552 Self Portrait, Cecilia Beaux, installation at the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy, Smithsonian Archives of American Art]</ref> In 1930 she published an [[autobiography]], ''Background with Figures''.<ref name=\"Columbus Museum of Art p.44\" /> Her later life was filled with honors. In 1930 she was elected a member of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]]; in 1933 came membership in the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], which two years later organized the first major retrospective of her work.

Her strong technique, her perceptive reading of her subjects, and her ability to flatter without falsifying, were traits similar to his. \n[[File:Cecilia Beaux - Man with the Cat (Henry Sturgis Drinker) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''Man with the Cat (Henry Sturgis Drinker)'', 1898]]\n\"The critics are very enthusiastic. (Bernard) Berenson, Mrs. Coates tells me, stood in front of the portraits &ndash; Miss Beaux's three \u2013 and wagged his head. 'Ah, yes, I see!' Some Sargents. The ordinary ones are signed John Sargent, the best are signed Cecilia Beaux, which is, of course, nonsense in more ways than one, but it is part of the generous chorus of praise.\"<ref>Goodyear, p. 17</ref> Though overshadowed by [[Mary Cassatt]] and relatively unknown to museum-goers today, Beaux's craftsmanship and extraordinary output were highly regarded in her time. While presenting the Carnegie Institute's Gold Medal to Beaux in 1899, [[William Merritt Chase]] stated \"Miss Beaux is not only the greatest living woman painter, but the best that has ever lived. Miss Beaux has done away entirely with sex [gender] in art.\"<ref>Carter, p. 127</ref>\n\nDuring her long productive life as an artist, she maintained her personal aesthetic and high standards against all distractions and countervailing forces. She constantly struggled for perfection, \"A perfect technique in anything,\" she stated in an interview, \"means that there has been no break in continuity between the conception and the act of performance.\" She summed up her driving work ethic, \"I can say this: When I attempt anything, I have a passionate determination to overcome every obstacle\u2026And I do my own work with a refusal to accept defeat that might almost be called painful.\"<ref>Carter, p. 173</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n* Grafly, Dorothy. \"Cecilia Beach\" in Edward T.

She specialized in [[portrait painting|portraiture]] and used a subdued [[Palette (painting)|palette]] dominated by the color gray. Brooks ignored contemporary artistic trends such as [[Cubism]] and [[Fauvism]], drawing instead on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]] movements of the 19th century, especially the works of [[James McNeill Whistler]]. Her subjects ranged from anonymous models to titled aristocrats.  She is best known for her images of women in androgynous or masculine dress, including her self-portrait of 1923, which is her most widely reproduced work.<ref>Latimer, ''Women Together'', 51.</ref>\n\nBrooks had an unhappy childhood after her father abandoned the family; her mother was emotionally abusive and her brother mentally ill.  By her own account, her childhood cast a shadow over her whole life. She spent several years in Italy and France as a poor art student, then inherited a fortune upon her mother's death in 1902. Wealth gave her the freedom to choose her own subjects.  She often painted people close to her, such as the Italian writer and politician [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], the Russian dancer [[Ida Rubinstein]], and her partner of more than 50 years, the writer [[Natalie Barney]].\n\nAlthough she lived until 1970, she painted very little after 1925. She made a series of line drawings during the early 1930s, using an \"unpremeditated\" technique resembling [[automatic drawing]], then virtually abandoned art, completing only a single portrait after [[World War II]].\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n=== Early life and education===\n\nBeatrice Romaine Goddard was born in [[Rome, Italy]], the youngest of three children of wealthy Americans Ella Waterman Goddard and Major Henry Goddard; her maternal grandfather was the multi-millionaire Isaac S. Waterman, Jr. Her parents divorced when she was small, and her father abandoned the family.  Beatrice was raised by her mother, who was unstable and abused her emotionally while doting on her [[mentally ill]] brother, St. Mar. They lived mostly in New York, where from an early age Goddard had to tend to St. Mar because he attacked anyone else who came near him. According to her memoir, when she was seven, her mother fostered her to a poor family living in a [[New York City]] tenement, then disappeared and stopped making the agreed-upon payments. The family continued to care for Beatrice, although they sank further into poverty. She did not tell them where her grandfather lived for fear of being returned to her mother.\n\n[[File:Romaine Brooks portrait, circa 1910.jpg|thumb|Romaine Brooks, ca. 1910 / Perou, photographer.

Later she attended a [[convent]] school, in between times spent with her mother, who moved around Europe constantly, although the stress of travel made St. Mar harder to control.<ref>Secrest, 17\u201342.</ref>  In adulthood Goddard Brooks referred to herself as having been a \"child-martyr\".<ref>Rodriguez, 223.</ref>\n\t  \nIn 1893 at the age of 19, Goddard left her family and went to Paris. She extracted a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a [[cabaret]], then travelled to [[Rome]] to study art. As the only female student in her [[life class]], as it was unusual for women to work from nude models, Goddard encountered what would now be called [[sexual harassment]]. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she picked it up and hit him in the face with it, and was not bothered again.<ref>Secrest, 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\t  \nIn the summer of 1899 Goddard rented a studio in the poorest part of the island of [[Capri]], which was a very inexpensive place to live. She studied art briefly in Paris, but her funds were insufficient.  After several months of near starvation, she suffered a physical breakdown. In 1901 her brother St. Mar died. She returned home to help care for her grief-stricken mother, who died less than a year later from complications of advanced [[diabetes]]. She was 28 when she and her sister inherited the large estate their grandfather had left, which made them independently wealthy.<ref>Secrest, 123\u2013145, 173.</ref>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nOn 13 June 1903 Goddard married her friend John Ellingham Brooks, an unsuccessful pianist and translator who was in deep financial difficulty. He was [[homosexual]], and the [[bisexual]] Goddard never revealed exactly why she married him. Her biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that she was motivated by concern for him and a desire for companionship, rather than the need for a [[marriage of convenience]]. They quarrelled almost immediately when she cut her hair and ordered men's clothes for a planned walking tour of England; he refused to be seen in public with her dressed that way. Chafing at his desire for outward propriety, she left him after only a year and moved to London. He frightened her because he kept making references to \"our\" money.<ref>Secrest, 179\u2013181.</ref> Brooks spent the rest of his life on [[Capri]] (where he died in 1929) and, for a while, lived there with [[E. F. Benson]],<ref>Diana Souhami (2004) ''Wild Girls''</ref> author of the ''[[Mapp and Lucia]]'' novels.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1904 Romaine Brooks, the name she preferred, became dissatisfied with her work, and in particular with the bright color schemes that she had used in her early paintings. She travelled to [[St. Ives, Cornwall|St. Ives]] on the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] coast, rented a small studio, and began learning to create finer gradations of gray. When a group of local artists asked her to give an informal show of her work, she displayed only some pieces of cardboard on which she had dabbed her experiments with gray paint. From then on, nearly all her paintings were dominated by gray, white, and black, sometimes with [[ochre]] or [[umber]]. She had found the palette she would use her whole career.<ref>Secrest, 186\u2013189.</ref>\n\n=== First exhibition ===\n[[File:Romaine Brooks - The Black Cap.jpg|thumb|right|''The Black Cap'' (1907)]]\nBrooks left St. Ives and moved to Paris. As painters such as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]] were reinventing art in the Bohemian districts of [[Montparnasse]] and [[Montmartre]], Brooks took an apartment in the fashionable [[16th arrondissement]], mingled in elite social circles, and painted portraits of wealthy and titled women.  This included her current lover, the [[Winnaretta Singer|Princess de Polignac]]. \n\nIn 1910 she had her first solo show at the prestigious Gallery [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]], displaying thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls. Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against monochromatic backgrounds, often with pensive or withdrawn expressions. The paintings were generally [[Naturalism (art)|naturalistic]], showing an attentive eye for the details of ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]'' fashion, with [[parasol]]s, [[veil]]s, and elaborate [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]] on display.<ref>Chadwick, 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nBrooks included two nude studies in this first exhibition&mdash;a provocative choice for a woman artist in 1910. In one, ''The Red Jacket'', a young woman stands in front of a large folding screen, wearing only a small open jacket, with her hands behind her back. She is so frail, and her downcast face looks so forlorn that one contemporary reviewer referred to her as a consumptive; Brooks described her simply as \"a poor girl who was cold\". The other, ''White Azaleas'', is a more sexually charged nude study of a woman reclining on a couch in Brooks's studio.  Contemporary reviews compared it to [[Francisco de Goya]]'s ''[[La maja desnuda]]'' and [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]''. Unlike the women in those paintings, the subject of ''White Azaleas'' looks away from the viewer, with a distinctly forbidding expression.<ref>Lucchesi, \"Apparition\", 75\u201376.</ref>\n\n[[File:Romaine Brooks - White Azaleas.jpg|thumb|left|''White Azaleas'' (1910)]]\nThe exhibition established Brooks's reputation as an artist. Reviews were effusive, and the poet [[Robert de Montesquiou]] wrote an appreciation calling her \"the thief of souls.\" The restrained, almost monochromatic decor of her home also attracted attention; she was often asked to give advice on interior design, and sometimes did, though she did not relish the role of decorator. She became more and more disillusioned with Parisian high society, finding the conversation dull and feeling that people were whispering about her.<ref>Secrest, 197, 204\u2013206.</ref>  Despite her artistic success, she described herself as a ''lapid\u00e9''&mdash;literally, a victim of stoning.<ref>Latimer, \"Sapphic Modernity\", 38.</ref><ref>See Romaine Brooks, On The Hills of Florence, SIA available on line</ref>\n\n=== Gabriele D'Annunzio and Ida Rubinstein ===\nIn 1909 Brooks met [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], an Italian writer and politician who had come to France to escape his debts. She saw him as a martyred artist, another ''lapid\u00e9''; he wrote poems based on her works and called her \"the most profound and wise orchestrator of grays in modern painting\".<ref>Secrest, 193.</ref>  They spent the summer of 1910 in a villa on the coast of [[France]], in a romantic interlude that was disrupted when D'Annunzio's jealous ex-mistress arrived in town. Their friendship remained strong throughout D'Annunzio's life.<ref name=\"chadwick22\u201323\">Chadwick, 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Brooks became romantically involved with [[Ida Rubinstein]], an actress and dancer formerly with [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]].  D'Annunzio had an obsessive but unrequited attraction to her as well.<ref>Lucchesi, \"Apparition\", 80 and Secrest, 243\u2013244.</ref> Rubinstein was deeply in love with Brooks; she wanted to buy a farm in the country where they could live alone together&mdash;a mode of life in which Brooks had no interest.<ref>Secrest, 243.</ref>  Although they broke up in 1914, Brooks painted Rubinstein more often than any other subject; for Brooks, Rubinstein's \"fragile and androgynous beauty\"<ref>From Brooks's unpublished memoir ''No Pleasant Memories''; quoted in Lucchesi, \"Apparition\", 85.</ref> represented an aesthetic ideal. The earliest of these paintings are a series of allegorical nudes. In ''The Crossing'' (also exhibited as ''The Dead Woman''), Rubinstein appears as a corpse, stretched on a white bed or bier against a black void; in ''Spring'', she strews flowers on the ground in a grassy meadow. When Rubinstein starred in D'Annunzio's play ''The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian'', Brooks painted her as [[Saint Sebastian]]&mdash;tied to a post, being shot with an arrow by a masked dwarf standing on a table. The dwarf is thought to represent D'Annunzio.<ref>Secrest, 248.</ref>\n\n[[File:Romaine Brooks - The Cross of France.jpg|thumb|right|''La France Crois\u00e9e'' (''The Cross of France'', 1914)]]\nAt the beginning of [[World War I]], Brooks painted ''The Cross of France'', a symbolic image of France at war, showing a Red Cross nurse looking off to the side with a resolute expression while [[Ypres]] burns in the distance behind her. Although it is not a portrait of Ida Rubinstein, it does resemble her, and she may have modelled for it. It was exhibited along with a poem by D'Annunzio calling for courage and resolution in wartime, and later reproduced in a booklet sold to raise funds for the Red Cross.<ref name=\"chadwick27\u201328\"/>  After the war, Brooks received the cross of the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]] for her fundraising efforts.\n\nThe political imagery of ''The Cross of France'' has been compared to [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]'s painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', in which a woman personifying Liberty holds up a flag against the background of a burning city.<ref name=\"chadwick27\u201328\">Chadwick, 27\u201328.</ref>  Delacroix's Liberty leads a group of Parisians who have taken up arms, while the subject of ''The Cross of France'' stands alone. Brooks used this romantic image of a figure in heroic isolation several times; a 1912 portrait of D'Annunzio, a 1914 self-portrait, and a portrait of Rubinstein completed in 1917 all show their subjects wrapped in dark cloaks and isolated against seascapes.<ref name=\"chadwick22\u201323\"/>\n\nDuring the war, D'Annunzio became a national hero as leader of a fighter squadron. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], he led a group of nationalist irregulars who seized and held the city of [[Fiume]] to prevent Italy from ceding it to [[Croatia]]. He briefly set up a government, the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]], with himself as [[Duce]]. Although he was never part of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government, he is regarded as a precursor of [[Fascism]]. The details of Brooks's own politics are unclear, but she was evidently sympathetic to Italian Fascism. The romantic individualism of her paintings may have been influenced by D'Annunzio's ideologies&mdash;an idea that has troubled some viewers otherwise attracted to the imagery of Brooks's portraits.<ref>Chadwick, 13, discusses D'Annunzio's influence; Langer, 47n5 and 47n9, cautions that: \"Brooks's support of Fascism has not been documented\" but nevertheless seems to agree she had some Fascist sympathies; Warren discusses her own reaction to Brooks's politics.</ref>\n\nBrooks painted Rubinstein one last time in ''The Weeping [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'' (1916\u201317), a nude based on a photograph taken during their relationship. According to her unpublished memoir, the painting represents \"the passing away of familiar gods\" as a result of World War I. She said she tried to repaint Venus's features many times, but Rubinstein's face somehow kept returning: \"It fixes itself in the mind.\"<ref>Lucchesi, \"Apparition\", 84\u201385.</ref>\n\n=== Natalie Barney and Left Bank portraits ===\n[[File:Romaine Brooks - Portrait of Natalie Barney.jpg|thumb|left|''Miss Natalie Barney, \"L'Amazone\"'' (1920).]]\nThe longest and most important relationship of Brooks's life was with [[Natalie Clifford Barney]], whom she met around the start of World War I. Barney was an American-born writer who hosted a literary [[salon (gathering)|salon]] on Paris's [[Left Bank]]. She was avowedly [[nonmonogamy|nonmonogamous]]; when they met she was already in a close long-term relationship with Duchess [[Elisabeth de Gramont|Elisabeth de Clermont-Tonnerre]], which would last until the Duchess' death in 1954.  She had many other relationships of varying length and devotion as well.\n\nBrooks tolerated Barney's casual affairs well enough to tease her about them, and had a few of her own over the years, but could become jealous when a new love became serious. Usually she simply left town, but at one point she gave Barney an ultimatum to choose between her and [[Dolly Wilde]]&mdash;relenting once Barney had given in.<ref>Rodriguez, 295\u2013301.</ref>  At the same time, while Brooks was devoted to Barney, she did not want to live with her full-time, as she disliked Paris, disdained Barney's friends, and hated the constant socializing on which Barney thrived.  She felt most fully herself when alone.<ref>Souhami, 137\u2013139, 146, and Secrest, 277.</ref>  To accommodate Brooks's need for solitude, they built a summer home consisting of two separate wings joined by a dining room, which they called ''Villa Trait d'Union,'' the \"hyphenated villa\". Brooks spent part of each year in Italy or travelling elsewhere in Europe, away from Barney.<ref>Rodriguez, 227, 295.</ref> The relationship lasted for more than 50 years.\n\nBrooks's portrait of Barney has a softer look than her other paintings of the 1920s. Barney sits, swathed in a fur coat, in the house at 20 Rue Jacob where she lived and held her salon. In the window behind her, the courtyard is dusted with snow. Brooks often included animals or models of animals in her compositions to represent the personalities of her sitters;<ref>Langer, 46.</ref> she painted Barney with a small sculpture of a horse, alluding to the love of riding that had led Remy de Gourmont to nickname her \"the Amazon\". The paper on which the horse stands may be one of Barney's manuscripts.<ref>Elliott and Wallace, 15 and 27n9.</ref>\n\nFrom 1920 to 1924, most of Brooks's subjects were of women who were in Barney's social circle or who visited her salon.  [[Truman Capote]], who toured Brooks's studio in the late 1940s, may have been exaggerating when he called it \"the all-time ultimate gallery of all the famous dykes from 1880 to 1935 or thereabouts\",<ref>Wickes, 257.</ref> but she did paint Elisabeth de Clermont-Tonnerre; Barney's lover Elizabeth Eyre de Lanux; her own lover [[Renata Borgatti]]; [[Una Vincenzo, Lady Troubridge|Una, Lady Troubridge]], the partner of [[Radclyffe Hall]]; and the artist [[Gluck (Hannah Gluckstein)]]. Another of Brooks's lovers was the wildly eccentric Marchesa [[Luisa Casati]], whose portrait she painted while on Capri in 1920.<ref>Ryersson, Scot D. and Michael Orlando Yaccarino. ''Infinite Variety: The Life and Legend of the Marchesa Casati'', University of Minnesota Press, 2004, pp. 107-112.</ref>\n\nSeveral of these paintings depict women who had adopted some aspects of male dress. While in 1903 Brooks had shocked her husband by cutting her hair short and ordering a suit of men's clothes from a tailor, by the mid-1920s [[bob cut|bobbed]] and [[crop (hairstyle)|cropped]] hairstyles were in and wearing tailored jackets&mdash;usually with a skirt&mdash;was a recognized fashion, discussed in magazines as the \"severely masculine\" look.<ref>Doan, 114\u2013117 and ''passim.''</ref>  Women like Gluck, Troubridge, and Brooks used variations of the masculine mode, not to pass as men, but as a signal&mdash;a way of making their sexuality visible to others. At the time these paintings were made, however, it was a code that only a select few knew how to read.<ref>Langer, 45 and Elliott, 74.</ref>  To a mainstream audience, the women in these paintings probably just looked fashionable.\n\n[[File:Romaine Brooks - Peter.jpg|thumb|right|''Peter, a Young English Girl'' (1923\u20131924), a portrait of the artist Gluck]]\nGluck, an English artist whom Brooks painted around 1923, was noted in the contemporary press as much for her style of dress as for her art. She pushed the masculine style further than most by wearing trousers on all occasions, which was not considered acceptable in the 1920s. Articles about her presented her cross-dressing as an artistic eccentricity or as a sign that she was ultra-modern.<ref>Doan, 117\u2013119.</ref>  Brooks's portrait shows Gluck in a starched white shirt, a silk tie, and a long black belted coat that she designed and had made by a \"mad dressmaker\";<ref>Elliott, 73.</ref> her right hand, at her waist, holds a man's hat. Brooks painted these masculine accoutrements with the same attention she had once given to the parasols and ostrich plumes of [[Belle \u00c9poque|La Belle \u00c9poque]]. But while many of her early paintings show sad and withdrawn figures \"consumed by petticoats, veiled hats and other period trappings of femininity\",<ref name=\"Duncan\">Duncan (2002).</ref> Gluck is self-possessed and quietly intense&mdash;an artist who insists on being taken seriously.<ref>Taylor, 13.</ref>  Her appearance is so androgynous that it would be difficult to identify her as a woman without help from the title, and the title itself&mdash;''Peter, a Young English Girl''&mdash;underscores the gender ambiguity of the image.<ref>Elliott and Wallace, 20.</ref>\n\nBrooks's 1923 self-portrait has a grimmer tone. Brooks&mdash;who also designed her own clothes<ref name=\"Langer, 45\">Langer, 45.</ref>&mdash;painted herself in a tailored riding coat, gloves, and top hat. Behind her is a ruined building rendered in gray and black, underneath a slate-colored sky. The only spots of strong color are her lipstick and the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor that she wears on her lapel, recalling the Red Cross insignia in ''The Cross of France''.<ref>Chadwick, 33.</ref>  Her eyes are shaded by the brim of her hat, so that, according to one critic, \"she's watching you before you get close enough to look at her. She's not passively inviting your approach; she's deciding whether you're worth bothering with.\"<ref>Cotter (2000).</ref>\n\n===Literary portraits of Brooks===\nIn 1925 Brooks had solo exhibitions in Paris, London, and New York. After that year she produced only four more paintings, including portraits of [[Carl Van Vechten]] in 1936 and Muriel Draper in 1938.<ref>Chadwick, 36.</ref>  At the same time that her artwork diminished, she became the subject of literary portraits by three writers.  Each portrayed her as part of lesbian social circles in Paris and [[Capri]].\n\nBrooks was the model for the painter Venetia Ford in [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s first novel, ''The Forge'' (1924). The protagonist, Susan Brent, first encounters Ford among a group of women at a [[masquerade ball]] in Paris; the descriptions of these women correspond closely to Brooks's portraits, particularly those of Elisabeth de Gramont and Una Troubridge. Brent decides to leave her husband and pursue art after seeing the painting ''The Weeping Venus''.<ref>Lucchesi, \"Something Hidden\", 173\u2013174.</ref> Brooks also appeared in [[Compton Mackenzie]]'s ''Extraordinary Women'' (1928), a novel about a group of lesbians on Capri during World War I, as the composer Olympia Leigh. Although the novel is satirical, Mackenzie treats Brooks with more dignity than the rest of the characters, portraying her as a detached observer of the others' jealous intrigues&mdash;even those of which she is the focus.<ref>Secrest, 286\u2013294.</ref> In [[Djuna Barnes]]'s ''[[Ladies Almanack]]'' (1928), a ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' of Natalie Barney's circle in Paris, she makes a brief appearance as Cynic Sal, who \"dresse[s] like a coachman of the period of [[Pecksniff]]\"<ref>Barnes, 36. Cynic Sal is identified as Brooks in Weiss, 156.</ref>&mdash;a reference to the style of dress seen in her 1923 self-portrait.\n\n=== Drawings and later life ===\n[[File:Romaine Brooks - The Impeders.jpg|thumb|right|''The Impeders'' (1930)]]\nIn 1930, while laid up with a sprained leg, Brooks began a series of more than 100 drawings of humans, angels, demons, animals, and monsters, all formed out of continuous curved lines. She said that when she started a line she did not know where it would go, and that the drawings \"evolve&nbsp;[d] from the subconscious...[w]ithout premeditation.\"<ref>Secrest, 308\u2013310.</ref> Brooks was writing her unpublished memoir ''No Pleasant Memories'' at the same time she began this series of drawings.  Critics have interpreted them as exploring the continuing effect of her childhood on her&mdash;a theme expressed even in the symbol she used to sign them, a wing tethered with a rope or chain.<ref>Chastain, 13\u201314.</ref>  Decades later, at 85, she said \"My dead mother gets between me and life.\"<ref>Secrest, v.</ref>\n\nBrooks stopped drawing around 1935.<ref>Chastain, 9.</ref>  She moved from Paris to a villa outside [[Florence, Italy]] in 1937, and in 1940&mdash;fleeing the invasion of France by Germany&mdash;Barney joined her there.<ref>Souhami, 169.</ref>  After [[World War II]] ended, Brooks declined to move back to Paris with Barney, saying she wanted to \"get back to [her] painting and painter's life\",<ref>Souhami, 178.</ref> but in fact she virtually abandoned art after the war.<ref>Chadwick, 37.</ref>  She lost interest in promoting her own work, leaving it to Barney to arrange gallery placements of her paintings.<ref>Souhami, 194.</ref>  She became increasingly reclusive, and while Barney continued to visit her frequently, by the mid-1950s she had to stay in a hotel, meeting Brooks only for lunch.<ref>Souhami, 183\u2013184.</ref>  Brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room, believing she was losing her eyesight.<ref>Secrest, 358.</ref>  She became paranoid, fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. In a 1965 letter she cautioned Barney not to lie down on the benches in her garden, lest the plants feed on her life force: \"Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry.\"<ref>Secrest, 376\u2013377.</ref> In the last year of her life, she stopped communicating with Barney entirely, leaving letters unanswered and refusing to open the door when Barney came to visit.<ref>Souhami, 197.</ref>  She died in [[Nice]], France, in 1970 at the age of 96.\n\n== Influences ==\n[[File:Whistler - At the Piano.jpg|thumb|left|James MacNeill Whistler, ''At the Piano'' (1858\u20131859)]]\n[[File:Romaine Brooks - Renata Borgatti.jpg|thumb|left|Romaine Brooks, ''[[Renata Borgatti]] at the Piano'' (1920)]]\n\nBrooks kept aloof from the artistic trends and movements of her time, \"act[ing] as if the [[Fauvists]], the [[Cubism|Cubists]], and the [[Abstract Expressionists]] did not exist.\"<ref>Secrest, 311.</ref> However, critics have identified the influence of [[Aubrey Beardsley]]'s illustrations and of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], particularly in her paintings of Ida Rubinstein.<ref>Chadwick, 26\u201327.</ref>  The imagery of the 1930s drawings suggests [[Surrealism]], and Brooks's use of \"unpremeditated\" drawing as a route to the subconscious resembles the experiments with [[automatic drawing]] made by Surrealists such as [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]].<ref>Chastain, 10.</ref>\n\nThe most widely observed influence on Brooks's painting is that of [[James McNeill Whistler]], whose subdued [[Palette (painting)|palette]] probably inspired her use of the color gray. She may have been introduced to Whistler's work by the art collector [[Charles Lang Freer]], whom she met on Capri around 1899, and who bought one of her early works.<ref>Secrest, 135\u2013136.</ref>  Brooks said she \"wondered at the magic subtlety of [Whistler's] tones\" but thought his 'symphonies' lacked corresponding subtlety of expression.<ref>Secrest, 186.</ref> One 1920 portrait may take its [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] from a painting by Whistler. While the poses are almost identical, Brooks removes the little girl and all the details of Whistler's domestic scene, leaving only Borgatti and her piano&mdash;an image of an artist completely focused on her art.<ref>Chadwick, 32.</ref>\n\n==Legacy and modern criticism==\n[[File:Romaine Brooks - Una Troubridge.jpg|thumb|right|''Una, Lady Troubridge'' (1924)]]\nBrooks's conservative style led many art critics to dismiss her, and by the 1960s her work was largely forgotten.<ref>Secrest, 311\u2013312.</ref>  The revival of [[Figurative art|figurative painting]] since the 1980s, and new interest in the exploration of gender and sexuality through art have led to a reassessment of her work.   She is now seen as a precursor of present-day artists whose works depict [[cross-dressing]] and [[transgender]] themes.<ref>Chadwick, 8, and Duncan. For an extended comparison of Brooks's portraits with a 1990s series of photographs by the transsexual artist Loren Cameron, see Melanie Taylor's \"Peter (A Young English Girl): Visualizing Transgender Masculinities.\"</ref>  Critics have described her portraits of the 1920s as a \"sly celebration of gender-bending as a kind of heroic act\"<ref name=\"Duncan\" /> and as creating \"the first visible [[Sappho|Sapphic]] stars in the history of modernism.\"<ref name=\"Langer, 45\"/>\n\nMore generally, Brooks's portraits starting with ''The Cross of France'' have been interpreted as creating new images of strong women. The portraits of the 1920s in particular&mdash;cross-dressed and otherwise&mdash;portray their subjects as powerful, self-confident, and fearless.<ref>Chadwick, 27, 32.</ref>  One critic compared them to the faces on [[Mount Rushmore]].<ref>O'Sullivan (2000).</ref> Brooks seems to have seen her portraits in this light. According to a memoir by Natalie Barney, one woman complained, upon seeing her portrait, \"You haven't beautified me\", to which Brooks replied, \"I have ennobled you.\"<ref>Natalie Barney, ''Aventures de l'Esprit,'' quoted in Jay, 30.</ref>\n\nYet Brooks did not always ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed her from the need to sell her paintings; she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could be devastating. A striking example is her 1914\u201315 portrait of [[Elsie de Wolfe]], an interior designer whom she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed on a table at her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.<ref>Langer, 46 and Secrest, 199 and 325\u2013326.</ref>\n\nOne of Brooks's most analyzed paintings, a 1924 portrait of Una, Lady Troubridge, has been seen as everything from an image of female self-empowerment to a caricature.<ref>Cassandra Langer calls it an image of female self-empowerment in \"Transgressing Le droit du seigneur: The Lesbian Feminist Defining Herself in Art History,\" ''New Feminist Criticism: Art-Identity-Action'', Joanna Frueh, Cassandra Langer, and Arlene Raven, eds. New York: HarperCollins, 1994. 320. Quoted in Chadwick, 35. Secrest, 124, describes it as a caricature.</ref>  Art critic Michael Duncan sees the painting as making fun of Troubridge's \"dandified appearance\", while for Meryle Secrest it is \"a tour de force of ironic commentary\".<ref>Secrest, 199.</ref> Laura Doan, pointing out newspaper and magazine articles from 1924 in which high collars, tailored satin jackets, and watch fobs are described as the latest in women's wear, describes Troubridge as having a \"keen fashion sense and an eye for sartorial detail\".<ref>Doan, 116\u2013117.</ref>  But, these British fashions may not have been favored in Paris; Natalie Barney and others in her circle considered Troubridge's outfits ridiculous.<ref>Rodriguez, 272.</ref>  Brooks expressed her own view in a letter to Barney: \"Una is funny to paint. Her get-up is remarkable. She will live perhaps and cause future generations to smile.\"<ref>Secrest, 292.</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{cite book | last = Barnes | first = Djuna | others = Introduction by Susan Sniader Lanser | year = 1992 | title = Ladies Almanack | location = New York | publisher = New York University Press | isbn = 0-8147-1180-4 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Chadwick | first = Whitney | others = Essay by Joe Lucchesi | title = Amazons in the Drawing Room: The Art of Romaine Brooks | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2000 | location = Berkeley | isbn = 0-520-22567-8}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Chastain | first = Catherine McNickle | title = Romaine Brooks: A New Look at Her Drawings | journal = Woman's Art Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 9\u201314 | publisher = Woman's Art, Inc.| date = Fall 2001 \u2013 Winter 2002 | doi = 10.2307/1358461 | jstor = 1358461}}\n* {{cite news | last = Cotter | first = Holland  | title = ART REVIEW; Politics Runs Through More Than Campaigns   | work = The New York Times | pages = | language = | publisher =  | date = 2000-08-25 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502EFDF1531F936A1575BC0A9669C8B63&sec=&pagewanted=1 | accessdate = 2006-10-02 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Doan | first = Laura | title = Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins of a Modern English Lesbian Culture | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 2001 | location = New York | isbn = 0-231-11007-3}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Duncan | first = Michael | title = Our Miss Brooks | journal = Art in America | volume =  | issue = | pages = | publisher = |date=March 2002 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_3_90/ai_83794210/pg_1 | format = }} {{dead link|date=March 2010}}\n* Elliott, Bridget. \"Performing the Picture or Painting the Other: Romaine Brooks, Gluck and the Question of Decadence in 1923.\"  {{cite book | last = Deepwell | first = Katy | title = Women Artists and Modernism | publisher = Manchester University Press | year = 1998 | location = Manchester and New York | isbn =  0-7190-5082-0}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Elliott | first = Bridget | first2 = Jo-Ann | last2 = Wallace | title = Fleurs du Mal or Second-Hand Roses?: Natalie Barney, Romaine Brooks, and the 'Originality of the Avant-Garde' | journal = Feminist Review | volume = 0| issue = 40 | pages = 6\u201330 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan Journals| date = Spring 1992  | doi = 10.2307/1395274 | jstor = 1395274 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Jay | first = Karla | title = The Amazon and the Page | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 1988 | location = Bloomington | isbn =  0-253-20476-3}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Langer | first = Cassandra | title = Review of ''Amazons in the Drawing Room: The Art of Romaine Brooks'' by Whitney Chadwick; Joe Lucchesi | journal = Woman's Art Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 44\u201347 | publisher = Woman's Art, Inc.| date = Autumn 2001 \u2013 Winter 2002 | doi = 10.2307/1358903 | last2 = Chadwick | first2 = Whitney | last3 = Lucchesi | first3 = Joe | jstor = 1358903}}\n* {{cite book | last = Latimer | first = Tirza True | title = Women Together / Women Apart: Portraits of Lesbian Paris | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 2005 | location = New Brunswick, NJ | pages = | isbn =  0-8135-3595-6}}\n* Latimer, Tirza True (2006). \"Romaine Brooks and the Future of Sapphic Modernity.\" {{cite book | last = Doan | first = Laura |author2=Jane Garrity | title = Sapphic Modernities: Sexuality, Women and English Culture | publisher = Palgrave MacMillan | year = 2006 | location = New York | pages = 35\u201354 | isbn = 1-4039-6498-X }}\n* {{cite web | last = Lockard | first = Ray Anne | title = Brooks, Romaine | work = glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture | publisher = | year = 2002 | url = http://www.glbtq.com/arts/brooks_r.html | accessdate = 2006-10-13 }}\n* Lucchesi, Joe.

Adeline de l'Etang was the daughter of [[Chevalier Antoine de l'Etang]], who had been a page of [[Marie Antoinette]] as well as an officer in the Garde du Corps of King Louis XVI.

They had five children together, and also raised five young relations and an Irish girl called Mary Ryan whom Cameron found begging in England.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Charlotte|title=Julia Margaret Cameron: soft-focus photographer with an iron will|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/22/julia-margaret-cameron-victorian-portrait-photographer-exhibitions|accessdate=25 July 2016|work=The Guardian|date=22 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1848, Charles Hay Cameron retired, and the family moved to London, England. Cameron's sister, [[Prinsep|Sarah Prinsep]], had been living in London and hosted a [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] at [[Little Holland House]], the [[dower house]] of [[Holland House, London|Holland House]] in [[Kensington]], where famous artists and writers regularly visited. In 1860, Cameron visited the estate of poet [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Cameron was taken with the location, and the Cameron family purchased a property on the island soon after. They called it [[Dimbola Lodge]] after the family's Ceylon estate.\n\n==Photography==\nIn 1863, when Cameron was 48 years old, her daughter gave her a camera as a present, thereby starting her career as a photographer. Within a year, Cameron became a member of the Photographic Societies of London and Scotland. She remained a member of the Photographic Society, London, until her death.<ref name=RPS>{{cite web|title=Members of the Royal Photographic Society, 1853\u20131901|url=http://rpsmembers.dmu.ac.uk/rps_results.php?mid=396|publisher=The Royal Photographic Society|date=2013|accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> In her photography, Cameron strove to capture beauty.

She later wrote that \"to my feeling about his beautiful photography I owed all my attempts and indeed consequently all my success\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/photography/features/photo_focus/cameron/related/index.html |title=Victoria and Albert Museum: Julia Margaret Cameron Related Photographers |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref>\n\n[[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]], her neighbour on the [[Isle of Wight]], often brought friends to see the photographer and her works.\n\nAt the time, photography was a labour-intensive art that also was highly dependent upon crucial timing. Sometimes Cameron was obsessive about her new occupation, with subjects sitting for countless exposures in the blinding light as she laboriously coated, exposed, and processed each wet plate. The results were, in fact, unconventional in their intimacy and their particular visual habit of created blur through both long exposures, where the subject moved, and leaving the lens intentionally out of focus. Other photographers strove for vastly different applications. This led some of her contemporaries to complain and even ridicule the work, but her friends and family were supportive, and she was one of the most prolific and advanced of amateurs in her time. Her enthusiasm for her craft meant that her children and others sometimes tired of her endless photographing, but it also left us with some of the best of records of her children and of the many notable figures of the time who visited her.\n\nDuring her career, Cameron registered each of her photographs with the [[copyright]] office and kept detailed records. Her shrewd business sense is one reason that so many of her works survive today. Another reason that many of Cameron's [[portrait]]s are significant is because they are often the only existing photograph of historical figures, becoming an invaluable resource. Many paintings and drawings exist, but, at the time, photography was still a new and challenging medium for someone outside a typical portrait studio.\n\nThe bulk of Cameron's photographs fit into two categories\u2014closely framed portraits and illustrative allegories based on religious and literary works. In the allegorical works in particular, her artistic influence was clearly [[Pre-Raphaelite]], with far-away looks, limp poses, and soft lighting.<ref>Rosenblum, Naomi. A History of Women Photographers. Third ed. New York: Abbeville Press Publishers, 2010. p.&nbsp;52.</ref>\n\n===Portraits===\n[[File:Sadness, by Julia Margaret Cameron.jpg|thumb|The [[Shakespeare]]an actress [[Ellen Terry]] photographed by Cameron in 1864]]\n\nCameron's sister ran the artistic scene at [[Little Holland House]], which gave her many famous subjects for her portraits. Some of her famous subjects include:  [[Charles Darwin]], [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], [[Robert Browning]], [[John Everett Millais]], [[William Michael Rossetti]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Ellen Terry]], and [[George Frederic Watts]]. Most of these distinctive portraits are cropped closely around the subject's face and are in soft focus. Often Cameron was a friend of these Victorian celebrities, and, knowing them well, tried to capture their personalities in her photographs. Among Cameron's lesser-known images are those she took of Mary Emily ('May') Prinsep, wife of [[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson]], the elder son of Alfred Tennyson and a British colonial administrator. Cameron's portraits of May Prinsep, taken on the Isle of Wight, show a somewhat plain woman shot head-on and without affect.<ref>[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp86999&rNo=0&role=sit 'Christabel' Mary Prinsep images] at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].</ref> May also sat for photographs that fall into the second major division of Cameron's works.\n\n===Photographic illustrations===\n[[File:Study of Beatrice Cenci, by Julia Margaret Cameron.jpg|thumb|upright|left|\"[[Beatrice Cenci]]\" (1866), a study for a photographic series devoted to Cenci by Julia Margaret Cameron]]\n\nCameron's posed photographic illustrations represent the other half of her work. In these illustrations, she frequently photographed historical scenes or characters drawn from literary works, which often took the quality of oil paintings. She made no attempt, however, to hide the backgrounds. Cameron's friendship with [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]] led to him asking her to photograph illustrations for his ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. These photographs are designed to resemble oil paintings from the same time period, including rich details such as historical costumes and intricate draperies. Today, these posed works are sometimes dismissed by art critics. Nevertheless, Cameron saw these photographs as art, comparable to the oil paintings they imitated.\n\nCameron posed May Prinsep (Hallam Tennyson's wife) to model as [[Beatrice Cenci]] in an 1866 albumen print portrait among a series she devoted to Cenci, illustrating a heroic legend developed in Rome when Cenci was executed for killing her brutal father who abused her and other members of their family.\n[[File:Julia Margaret Cameron (British, born India - Parting of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''Parting of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere'' (1874)]]\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1875, the Camerons moved back to [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]). Cameron continued to practise photography, but she complained in letters about the difficulties of getting chemicals and pure water to develop and print photographs. Also, in Ceylon, she did not have access to the Little Holland House salon's artistic community for subjects. She also did not have a market to distribute her photographs as she had in England. Because of this, Cameron took fewer images in Ceylon. Those she did were of posed Ceylonese people, paralleling the posed pictures that Cameron had taken of neighbours in England. Almost none of Cameron's work from Ceylon survives.\n\nCameron died while in Ceylon. Her death is attributed to having caught a bad chill and she died in [[Kalutara]], Ceylon in 1879.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Cameron julia jackson.jpg|thumb|upright|Cameron portrait of Julia Prinsep Jackson, later Julia Stephen, Cameron's niece, favourite subject, and the mother of the author [[Virginia Woolf]]]]\n\nCameron's niece Julia Prinsep Stephen (n\u00e9e Jackson; 1846\u20131895) wrote the biography of Cameron that appeared in the first edition of the ''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1886.<ref>Stephen, L.

(1948). [http://worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/2613108 Julia Margaret Cameron; her life and photographic work. Famous photographers].

For instance in 1975 [[Imogen Cunningham]] had commented \"I'd like to see portrait photography go right back to Julia Margaret Cameron. I don't think there's anyone better.\"<ref name=\"DWP\"/>\n\nIn 2013, [[Getty Images]] noted in its caption of a portrait of [[Alice Liddell]] (whom Cameron photographed as [[Alethea]], [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], and St. Agnes in 1872) that \"Cameron's photographic portraits are considered among the finest in the early history of photography\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/photograph-by-julia-margaret-cameron-of-alice-liddell-who-news-photo/90762993|title=Photograph by Julia Margaret Cameron of Alice Liddell: Getty Images #90762993|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2013, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] opened an exhibition of some representative examples of the photography of Cameron. Although only including limited numbers from her \"copious\" body of works, the exhibition garnered significant reviews.<ref>Lane, Anthony, ''Names and Faces, the portraits of Julia Margaret Cameron'', [[The New Yorker]], 2 September 2013, pages 69\u201373.</ref>\n\nOften, Julia Margaret Cameron's work is discussed in relation to the portraiture of another upper-class British female photographer, [[Lady Clementina Hawarden]].\n\nAn exhibition of more than 100 of Cameron's works was held in the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in 2015, one of three exhibitions from the collections of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] touring Australia at the time.

Her father, Louis Prosper, dealt in mortgages and bank transactions. Her mother, the former Louise Athana\u00efse C\u00e9cile Cerveaux, came from a [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] family of [[Catholic]] farmers and [[priest]]s. The family moved to [[Villeneuve-sur-F\u00e8re]] while Camille was still a baby. Her younger brother Paul Claudel was born there in 1868. Subsequently they moved to [[Bar-le-Duc]] (1870), [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] (1876), and [[Wassy-sur-Blaise]] (1879), although they continued to spend summers in Villeneuve-sur-F\u00e8re, and the stark landscape of that region made a deep impression on the children. Camille moved with her mother, brother and younger sister to the [[Montparnasse]] area of [[Paris]] in 1881, her father having to remain behind, working to support them.\n\n== Creative period ==\n[[File:Rodin p1070087.jpg|thumb|left|[[Auguste Rodin]], ''Portrait of Camille Claudel with a Bonnet'', 1886]]\nFascinated with stone and soil as a child, as a young woman she studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]] with sculptor [[Alfred Boucher]]. (At the time, the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] barred women from enrolling to study.)  In 1882, Claudel rented a workshop with other young women, mostly English, including [[Jessie Lipscomb]]. Alfred Boucher became her mentor and provided inspiration and encouragement to the next generation of sculptors such as Laure Coutan and Claudel. The latter was depicted in \"Camille Claudel lisant\" by Boucher<ref name=\"exporevue.com\">[http://www.exporevue.com/magazine/fr/camille_claudel.html Camille Claudel r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e, exporevue, magazine, art vivant et actualit\u00e9<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.exporevue.com</ref> and later she herself sculpted a bust of her mentor. Before moving to Florence and after having taught Claudel and others for over three years, Boucher asked [[Auguste Rodin]] to take over the instruction of his pupils. This is how Rodin and Claudel met and their tumultuous and passionate relationship started.\n\nAround 1884, she started working in Rodin's workshop. Claudel became a source of inspiration, his model, his confidante and lover. She never lived with Rodin, who was reluctant to end his 20-year relationship with [[Rose Beuret]]. Knowledge of the affair agitated her family, especially her mother, who already detested her for not being a male child (who would have replaced her first-born male infant) and never agreed with Claudel's involvement in the arts.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Runco|first1=Mark A.|last2=Pritzker|first2=Steven R.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity|date=May 20, 2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123750389|page=763|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dI6mI7kg4O0C&pg=PT763}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mahon|first1=Elizabeth Kerri|title=Memories of Our Lost Hands: Searching for Feminine Spirituality And Creativity|date=2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101478813|pages=37--38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgQmOA61vR0C&pg=PT199}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Schmoll gen.

The novelist and art critic [[Octave Mirbeau]] described her as \"A revolt against nature: a woman genius.\" Her early work is similar to Rodin's in spirit, but shows an imagination and lyricism quite her own, particularly in the famous ''Bronze Waltz'' (1893). ''[[The Mature Age]]'' (1900) whilst interpreted by her brother as a powerful allegory of her break with Rodin, with one figure ''The Implorer'' that was produced as an edition of its own, has also been interpreted in a less purely autobiographical mode as an even more powerful representation of change and purpose in the human condition.<ref>The different scales, the different modes of plasticity, and gender-representation, of the three figures which make up this important group, enable a more universal thematic and metaphoric stylistics related to the ages of existence, childhood, maturity, and the perspective of the transcendent (v. Angela Ryan, \"Camille Claudel: the Artist as Heroinic Rhetorician.\" Irish Women's Studies Review vol 8: Making a Difference: Women and the Creative Arts. (December 2002): 13-28).</ref> Louis Vauxcelles states that Claudel was the only sculptress on whose forehead shone the sign of genius like Berthe Morisot the only female painter of the century, noting that her style was more virile than many male colleagues. Others like Morhardt and Caranfa concurred, saying that their styles have become so different, with Rodin being more suave and delicate and Claudel being vehement with vigorous contrasts, and this might have been one reason that led to their break up, with her becoming ultimately his rival.{{sfn|Eisen|2003|p=308}}{{sfn|Vollmer|2007|p=249}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rodin|first1=Auguste|last2=Crone|first2=Rainer|last3=Salzmann|first3=Siegfried|title=Rodin: Eros and creativity|date=1997|publisher=Prestel|isbn=9783791318097|page=41}}</ref>\n\n[[File:La Valse.jpg|thumb|The Waltz (Conceived in 1889 and cast in 1905)]]\n\nHer [[onyx]] and bronze small-scale ''Wave'' (1897) was a conscious break in style with her Rodin period, with a decorative quality quite different from the \"heroic\" feeling of her earlier work.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th Century, Claudel had patrons, dealers, and some commercial success.\n\n[[File:L62 - Mus\u00e9e Rodin - Camile Claudel - La Vague.JPG|thumb|La Vague (1897)]]\nLe Cornec and Pollock state that due to gendered censorship, Claudel could not get the funding to get many of her daring ideas realized due to their sexual element, and thus had to either depend on Rodin to realize them or collaborate with him and let him get the credit as the lionized figure of French sculptures. She also depended on him financially since after her wealthy, loving father died, her mother and brother who were suspicious of her lifestyle kept the money and let her wander around the streets, dressing in beggars' clothes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Akbar|first1=Arifa|title=How Rodin's tragic lover shaped the history of sculpture|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/how-rodins-tragic-lover-shaped-the-history-of-sculpture-8026836.html|agency=http://www.independent.co.uk|date=2012}}</ref> \n[[File:Claudel-2014-05.jpg|thumb|''The Age of Maturity'' (between 1898 and 1913)]]\n\nAfter Rodin saw ''The Age of Maturity'' for the first time in 1899, he reacted with shock and anger and suddenly stopped his support for Claudel completely. According to Ayral-Clause, he might have put pressure on the ministry of fine arts to cancel the funding for the bronze commission.

A large exhibition of her works was organized in 1984. In 2005 a large art display featuring the works of Rodin and Claudel was exhibited in [[Quebec City]] (Canada), and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], in the US. In 2008, the [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]] organized a retrospective exhibition including more than 80 of her works.\n\nThe publication of several biographies in the 1980s sparked a resurgence of interest in her work.\n\n''[[Camille Claudel (film)|Camille Claudel]]'' (1988) was a dramatization of her life based largely on historical records. Directed by [[Bruno Nuytten]], co-produced by [[Isabelle Adjani]], starring herself as Claudel and [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Rodin, the film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] in 1989. Another film, ''[[Camille Claudel 1915]]'', directed by [[Bruno Dumont]], premiered at the [[63rd Berlin International Film Festival]] in 2013. The actress [[Juliette Binoche]] played the sculptor, who was sent to an asylum in 1915.\n\nComposer [[Jeremy Beck]]'s ''Death of a Little Girl with Doves'' (1998), an operatic soliloquy for soprano and orchestra, is based on the life and letters of Camille Claudel.

Her artistic career developed during her widowhood.\n\nAnne was a frequent visitor to Europe. During one voyage she was captured by a [[privateer]], but released unharmed in [[Jersey]]. She visited [[Sir Horatio Mann, 2nd Baronet|Sir Horace Mann]] in [[Florence]], and [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] in [[Naples]], where she was introduced to [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]]. In 1802, while the [[Treaty of Amiens]] was in effect, she visited [[Paris]] with the author [[Mary Berry (writer, born 1763)|Mary Berry]] and was granted an audience with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]].\n\nFrom 1818, Anne Damer lived at [[York House, Twickenham]].

On the morning of her seventeenth birthday, Evelyn recorded in her diary, \"Art is eternal, but life is short\u2026\" \"I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose.\" She went on to persuade her parents to let her go to art school. At first they discouraged it, but in 1873 she was enrolled at the [[Slade School of Art]]. She was granted a scholarship at Slade which entitled her to three years of financial assistance. However, since the scholarship required that she draw nudes using charcoal and she did not care for this technique, she eventually declined it.<ref name=\"oxfordartonline.com\" />\n\nShe was also a pupil of her uncle John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, who was a great influence on her works. Beginning in 1875, Evelyn often visited him in [[Florence]] where he lived. This also enabled her to study the great artists of the Renaissance; she was particularly fond of the works of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]. This influenced her to move away from the classical subjects favored by the Slade school and to make her own style. She first exhibited in 1877 at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in London and continued to show her paintings thereafter.<ref name=\"oxfordartonline.com\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Demorgans.jpg|left|thumb|Evelyn and William De Morgan]]\n\nIn August 1883 Evelyn met William De Morgan, and in 5 March 1887, she married the ceramicist [[William De Morgan]].<ref name=\"Gordon1996\" /> They spent their lives together in London.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> De Morgan, a pacifist, expressed her horror at the First World War and South African War in over fifteen war paintings including ''The Red Cross''<ref name=\"Gear\" /> and ''S.O.S.''\n\nRelative to artistic pursuits, money was unimportant to the De Morgans; any profits from sales of Evelyn's paintings went toward financing William\u2019s pottery business and she actively contributed ideas to his ceramics designs.<ref name=\"Gear\" />\n\nTwo years after his death in 1917, she died on 2 May 1919 in London and was buried in [[Brookwood Cemetery]], near Woking, Surrey.<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Night and Sleep - Evelyn de Morgan (1878).jpg|thumbnail|''Night and Sleep'' -  Evelyn de Morgan  (1878)]]In August 1875 Evelyn sold her first work  ''Tobias and the Angel.''

Krehbiel''' (17 February 1875&ndash;\u201324 July 1951) was an American painter, photographer, [[printmaker]], [[illustrator]], and [[etcher]].\n\nEvans received commissions from the [[Armour and Company|Armour Food Company]] and [[Santa Fe Railroad]] to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to photograph Native American subjects in their daily routine and performing ritualistic dances.\n\n==Early life==\nOn February 17, 1875, Dulah Marie Llan Evans was born in [[Oskaloosa, Iowa]]. Here parents were builder and architect David Evans (1825-1897) and Marie Ogg Evans (1845-1897). She had an older brother and sister, and a younger sibling. Her mother immigrated to the United States from Switzerland. Her sister was Mayetta Evans, a playwright and art dealer in Chicago.<ref name=\"IWA\">[http://iwa.bradley.edu/artists/DulahKrehbiel ''Dulah Evans Krehbiel.''] Illinois Women Artist Project. Retrieved May 1, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Education==\nEvans attended [[William Penn University]] and in 1896 began her studies at [[The Art Institute of Chicago]],<ref name=\"IWA\" /> where she studied under [[John Vanderpoel]] and [[Frederick Richardson]] and subsequently graduated.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} While a student at The Art Institute, Dulah spent her summers in [[Saugatuck, Michigan]], studying under [[John Christen Johansen]] and other prominent artists.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} She completed her postgraduate work at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] in [[New York]],<ref name=\"IWA\" /> where she won many first place awards in illustration classes under the instruction of Walter Appleton Clark.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} She also studied under [[Charles Hawthorne]] in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]],{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and at the [[New York School of Art]] under [[William Merritt Chase]]<ref name=\"IWA\" /> in [[American Impressionism]].\n\n==Early career==\nThis was the '[[Illustration|Golden Age of Illustration]]' (1865\u20131917) and Dulah was part of it. She held a place in the prestigious [[Tree Studio Building and Annexes|Tree Studio building]] in Chicago from 1903 through 1905 along with other well-known painters such as Pauline Palmer, Walter Marshall Clute, [[Louis Betts]], and sculptor Julia Bracken Wendt, with whom she developed a close friendship.  During these years, Dulah was working as an illustrator and freelance commercial artist, creating images for the covers of magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[Leslie's Illustrated Weekly]]'', and ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''.\n\nDulah also accepted commissions from the [[Armour and Company|Armour Food Company]] and [[Santa Fe Railroad]], both headquartered in Chicago at the time. These commissions often took Dulah to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], to photograph [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] subjects in their daily routine and performing ritualistic dances. Many of Dulah's Southwest photographs would be used in later years as the subjects for her paintings, woodcuts, [[lithograph]]s, and etchings. She completed a series of three paintings related to The Deer Dance of the Tesuque Indians in 1905.\n\n==Marriage==\nDulah left the Tree Studio in 1906 to marry [[Albert Henry Krehbiel]] (1873\u20131945), a classmate from The Art Institute of Chicago. Albert was awarded an American Traveling Scholarship from the Art Institute in 1903 and, having spent three years studying at [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in [[Paris]] and traveling and painting throughout [[Europe]], had accepted a teaching position at the Institute upon his return in May 1906. In 1907, Albert reduced his schedule to teaching summer sessions only and undertook the awarded commission to design and paint the eleven wall and two ceiling murals for the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] Building in the state capitol of Springfield (the murals were completed in 1911). Dulah was Albert's only assistant, performing the duties of designing costumes, modeling, and conducting research on material pertinent to the theme of the murals. As with many husband and wife artists of the time, Dulah and Albert frequently painted together and often painted the same subject. They each had a high regard for the other's work and Albert, unlike many men of his day, was proud of his wife's artistic career and success.\n\nFrom 1910 through 1915, Dulah worked out of her new \"Ridge Crafts Studio\" in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], a suburb north of Chicago where she and Albert had purchased a large home. Here, she created a line of exclusively designed cards and folders for all occasions. Most of these cards were hand-colored engraved images, while others were hand-colored lithographs. A sample sales book of these cards is now in the collection of the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  Dulah's assistants, appropriately called the \"Ridge Craft Girls\", often pulled double duty as models for both Dulah's and Albert's paintings.  However, no individual was asked to pose more than their son and only child, Evans Llan Krehbiel, born in 1914. One of Dulah's first paintings of Evans, appropriately titled ''Baby Krehbiel'' (1915, 22\" x 30\", oil on canvas), was featured in the [[Chicago Daily Herald]] on March 14, 1915.\n\nDuring these early years in Park Ridge, Dulah and Albert were part of the ''Park Ridge [[Art colony]]''. Founded by members of the faculty of the Art Institute, the colony's objective was to create a society that would work for the encouragement of artistic culture. As was stated in an article in [[Newspapers of the Chicago metropolitan area|The Chicago Evening Post]] (July 6, 1912);\n\n\" . . . All intend to support the new association, which will expend its energies in public school art, and co-operate with the other clubs, while going its own way in search of culture.\"\n\nAmong the other distinguished members of the ''Park Ridge Art Colony'' were founding painters Frederick Richardson, James William Pattison, Louis Betts, and Walter Marshall Clute, and [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[John Paulding, (sculptor)|John Paulding]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===California===\nFrom 1917 through 1920, Dulah (traveling with Albert, Evans, and her sister, journalist and playwright Mayetta Evans) spent summers painting in [[California]] at the ''[[Santa Monica]] [[Art colony]]''.  Dulah's friend and fellow Tree Studio artist, Julia Bracken, had married painter [[William Wendt]] in 1906 and moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], becoming one of the city's foremost sculptors. By 1918, William Wendt had built a studio at [[Laguna Beach]] and [[American Impressionism|California Impressionism]] was in full swing.  Dulah's many paintings of her son and sister posing along the beach reflected this style. One such work, ''Santa Monica Bay'' (1920, 17\" x 21\", oil on canvas), was exhibited at the [[Arts Club of Chicago]] in 1923, where Dulah was a founding member.\n\nDulah would return to Santa Monica many times, often after having spent the initial summer months at the ''[[Art colony]] of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]'' in [[New Mexico]], which was started by [[Alice Corbin Henderson]], editor of the magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', and wife of Indian motif painter [[William Penhallow Henderson]].  In 1927, Dulah visited fellow artist [[Bror Julius Olsson Nordfeldt]] at his studio in Santa Fe, where she and her sister bought ten of his paintings. On this trip, Dulah took photographs of the studios of several Taos artists, including those of [[Ernest Blumenschein]], painter and one of the founders of the [[Taos art colony|Taos Society of Artists]], and painter [[Gerald Cassidy]], as well as photographs of the home of [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]]. (A wealthy heiress from New York, Mabel Dodge Luhan transformed [[Taos, New Mexico]], into an [[artist colony]] in the 1920s and 30s by inviting such noted artists as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]] to join her in the town's idyllic setting, which she considered to be the center for cultural and spiritual salvation.) \n  \nIt was in California that Dulah began painting in the [[modernist]] style. She created works that were more introspective in nature and which had spiritual overtones. Dulah became interested in the organization of multiple figures, often using groupings of three (perhaps to reveal a spiritual synthesis) in [[surrealism|surrealistic]] mountain landscapes. She produced different tensions with each canvas by the placement of subject figures in positions juxtaposed to their rocky surroundings. One such work, ''Mountain Pass'' (September 1920, 23\" x 24\", oil on canvas), was exhibited at the Chicago Arts Club in 1927. Dulah created her first etchings relating to the Southwest in 1927.  Her Southwest prints were sold in the Albert Roullier Galleries in Chicago and were often featured in Chicago newspapers and magazines. In 1930, Dulah left Park Ridge for New York City, where she was successful in establishing a market for her artwork at the ''Salons of America'' and the ''[[Society of Independent Artists]]''.\n\n===Studio Place===\nReturning to her Park Ridge home and her studio (now called \"Studio Place\") in 1932, Dulah persevered in creating her ethereal landscapes throughout the decade and beyond. From the early 1920s through the 1940s, she exhibited at the [[Arts Club of Chicago]] with other well-known artists, including painter Pauline Palmer and [[Bauhaus]] photographer [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]], and at The Art Institute of Chicago with painters [[Gerald Cassidy]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]], [[Edgar Payne]], and [[J. Alden Weir]]. As if to reflect the diversity of her art, throughout her career Dulah signed her works as Dulah Marie Evans, Dulah Llan Evans, and as Dulah Evans Krehbiel.\n\nThe Park Ridge Modernist, as Dulah had become known, died at the age of 76 on July 24, 1951, in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. Dulah's impressionistic work, ''Three Ladies at an Open Window'' (August 1920, 14\" x 17\", oil on canvas) was selected in 2001 for the permanent collection of the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C.\n\n==Collections==\n*National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Clara\">[http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail&entity_id=15958 Dulah Marie Evans Krehbiel, 1875-1951], The National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C.

She was Manet's only formal student and modeled frequently for several members of the Impressionist school. Gonzal\u00e8s posed for Manet in 1869 for the painting \"Portrait of Mlle Gonzal\u00e8s\", a work which has previously been discussed more than Gonzal\u00e8s' oeuvre at her own 1885 retrospective and at Galerie Daber's exhibition for her work in 1950.<ref name=Emmer>{{cite web|last1=Emmer|first1=Janalee|title=Dr.|url=http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/emmer,-janalee---rethinking-self--eva-gonzales-%281849-1883%29-on-her-own.pdf|website=http://www.huichawaii.org/|publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile studying under Manet, Gonzal\u00e8s self-portraits suggest she was exploring her individuality and identity as an artist by presenting subtle correctives to Manet's version of her. Until 1872, she was strongly influenced by Manet but later developed her own, more personal style.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Prussian War]] she sought refuge in [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]].<ref name=dictionary />\n\nShe married the graphic artist [[Henri Gu\u00e9rard]] in 1879, and used him and her sister Jeanne Gonzal\u00e8s<ref>After a quote from Curator of \"Women Impressionists\" Exhibition at the Marmottan Museum http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/arts/3-artists-who-left-a-fainter-impression.html</ref> as the subjects for many of her paintings.\n\nHer work was exhibited at the offices of the art review L'Art in 1882 and  at the [[Georges Petit|Galerie Georges Petit]] in 1883.

She was born on 26 May 1837 at Altyre, near [[Forres]] in [[Scotland]], the 12th child of a wealthy family. Her parents were [[Sir William Gordon-Cumming, 2nd Baronet]], and Elizabeth Maria (Campbell) Cumming. She was the aunt of Sir [[William Gordon-Cumming, 4th Baronet]]. She grew up in [[Northumberland]], and was educated at [[Fulham]], London. She taught herself how to paint, and had help from artists visiting her home, including one of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s favorite painters, [[Edwin Henry Landseer|Sir Edwin Landseer]]. After spending a year in [[India]] in 1867 and writing in ''In the Himalayas and on the Indian Plains'' (1884)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/inhimalayasando00cummgoog#page/n6/mode/2up| year=1884| place=London| publisher=Chatto and Windus| title=In the Himalayas and on the Indian Plains| author=Cumming, C.F.Gordon}}</ref> she became interested in travel.\n\nGordon-Cumming was a prolific travel writer and landscape painter who traveled the world, mostly in Asia and the Pacific. She painted over a thousand [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]]. Places she visited include [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[United States|America]], [[China]], and [[Japan]]. She arrived in [[Hilo, Hawaii]] in October 1879, and was among the first artists to paint the active volcanoes.<ref>Severson, Don R. ''Finding Paradise: Island Art in Private Collections'', University of Hawaii Press, 2002, p. 93</ref>  Her Hawaii travelogue, ''Fire Fountains: The Kingdom of Hawaii'', was published in [[Edinburgh]] in 1883.<ref>Severson, Don R. ''Finding Paradise: Island Art in Private Collections'', University of Hawaii Press, 2002, p. 93</ref>\n\nHer best known books are ''At Home in Fiji'' and ''A Lady's Cruise on a French Man-of-War''. The latter book resulted from an invitation to join a French ship put into service for the Bishop of [[Samoa]] so that he could visit remote parts of his far-flung diocese.\n\nMiss Gordon-Cumming received much criticism from male writers of the era, perhaps because she did not fit in the traditional [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] role of women, as she often traveled alone and unaided. [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] said her books are a collection of anecdotes without much interest. In any case, her landscape drawings and watercolors seem to be universally admired.\n\nGordon-Cumming visited [[Yosemite Valley]] in April 1878, after visiting [[Tahiti]]. She intended to visit for 3 days, but ended up staying 3 months. She says \"I for one have wandered far enough over the wide world to know a unique glory when I am blessed by the sight of one . . .\" She published her letters back home as [http://www.yosemite.ca.us/history/granite_crags/ ''Granite Crags''] in 1884. While in Yosemite Miss Gordon-Cumming also drew watercolor sketches, which she displayed in Yosemite Valley&mdash;making it the first art exhibition in Yosemite.\n\nIn 1879, while visiting Peking, China, Miss Gordon-Cumming met William Hill Murray, a Scottish missionary to China. He had invented the Numeral Type system, through which blind and illiterate Chinese learned to read and write, by assigning numbers to each of the 408 Chinese [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] sounds. Gordon-Cumming wrote a book (1899) about the system and supported the school for the rest of her life. She died in [[Scotland]] on 4 September 1924, and is buried near [[Crieff]].\n\nThe [[Honolulu Museum of Art]], the [[Oakland Museum of California]] and the [[Yosemite Museum]] are among the public collections holding works by Constance Gordon-Cumming.<ref>[http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/search/Search_Grid.aspx?searchtype=MUSEUMS&artist=3300 AskArt.com]</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n<gallery>\nImage:'Temporary Chimneys and Fire Fountains', watercolor by Constance Gordon-Cumming, c. 1880.jpg|'Temporary Chimneys and Fire Fountains', watercolor by Constance Gordon-Cumming, c. 1880\nImage:Indian_Life_at_Mirror_Lake_1878_by_Constance_Frederica_Gordon-Cumming.jpg|''Indian Life at Mirror Lake'' (1878) by C.

(The college was then headed by [[Richard Burchett]].) Her first book, ''[[Under the Window]]'' (1879), a collection of simple, perfectly [[idyll]]ic verses about children, was a best-seller.\n\n[[File:39 Frognal.jpg|thumb|left|The house in [[Frognal]] built for Kate Greenaway by [[Richard Norman Shaw]].]]\n\nGreenaway's paintings were reproduced by [[chromoxylography]], by which the colours were printed from hand-engraved wood blocks by the firm of [[Edmund Evans]]. Through the 1880s and 1890s, her only rivals in popularity in children's [[book illustration]] were [[Walter Crane]] and [[Randolph Caldecott]].\n\nAs well as illustrating books Greenaway produced a number of [[bookplates]].<ref>Clark, Keith. ''The Bookplate Designs of Kate Greenaway'', in ''The Private Library'' Autumn 1975, published by the [[Private Libraries Association]]</ref>\n\n\"Kate Greenaway\" children, all of them little girls and boys too young to be put in trousers, were dressed in her own versions of [[1795\u20131820 in fashion|late eighteenth century and Regency fashions]]: [[smock-frock]]s and [[skeleton suit]]s for boys, high-waisted pinafores and dresses with [[Bonnet (headgear)|mobcaps and straw bonnet]]s for girls. The influence of children's clothes in portraits by British painter [[John Hoppner]] (1758\u20131810) may have provided her some inspiration. [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty of London]] adapted Kate Greenaway's drawings as designs for actual children's clothes. A full generation of mothers in the liberal-minded \"artistic\" British circles who called themselves \"[[The Souls]]\" and embraced the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] dressed their daughters in Kate Greenaway pantaloons and bonnets in the 1880s and 1890s. The style was often used by painter [[Maude Goodman]] in her depictions of children.\n\nGreenaway was elected to membership of the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]] in 1889.  She lived in an Arts and Crafts style house she commissioned from [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in [[Frognal]], London, although she spent summers in Rolleston, near [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]].\n\nGreenaway died of breast cancer in 1901, at the age of 55. She is buried in [[Hampstead Cemetery]], London.  The [[Kate Greenaway Medal]], established in her honour in 1955, is awarded annually by the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] in the UK to an illustrator of children's books.\n\n==Books illustrated==\n{{hidden begin|toggle=left|title=List of works}}\n* Kingston, William, ''Infant Amusements, or How to Make a Nursery Happy'', 1867.\n* Aulnoy, Marie, ''Madame D'Aulnoy's Fairy Tales'', 9 v., Gall and Inglis, 1871.\n* ''Aunt Louisa's London Toy Books: Diamonds and Toads'', Warne, 1871.\n* Jeune, Margaret S., ''My School Days in Paris'', London, Griffith and Farran, 1871.\n* Knox, Kathleen, ''Fairy Gifts; or, A Wallet of Wonders'', Griffith & Farran, 1874.\n* Aunt Cae, ''The Children of the Parsonage'', Griffith & Farran, 1874.\n* Mulholland, Rosa, ''Puck and Blossom'', Marcus Ward, 1874.\n* Hill, Miranda, ''The Fairy Spinner'', Marcus Ward, 1874.\n* Jerrold, Alice, ''A Cruise in the Acorn'', London, Marcus Ward, 1875.\n* Clark, Mary Senior, ''Turnaside Cottage'', London, Marcus Ward, 1875.\n* Potter, Frederick Scarlett, ''Melcomb Manor: A Family Chronicle'', London, Marcus Ward, 1875.\n* ''Children\u2019s Songs'', London, Marcus Ward, c. 1875.\n* Knox, Kathleen, ''Seven Birthdays; or, The Children of Fortune'', Griffith & Farran, 1875.\n* 'Quiver of Love, a Collection of Valentines' (with Walter Crane), Marcus Ward, 1876.\n* LaBlanche, Fanny, ''Starlight Stories Told to Bright Eyes and Listening Ears'', Griffith & Farran, 1877.\n* Russell, Rutherford, ''Tom Seven Years Old'', London, Marcus Ward, 1877.\n* Hunt, Mrs. Bonavia, ''Poor Nelly'', London, Cassell, Petter, Gilpin, 1878.\n* Campbell, Lady Colin, ''Topo: A Tale About English Children in Italy'', Marcus Ward, 1878.\n* Yonge, Charlotte Mary, ''Heartsease; or The Brother\u2019s Wife'', Macmillan, 1879.\n* Yonge, Charlotte Mary, ''The Heir of Redclyffe'', Macmillan, 1879.\n* Pollock,  Walter Herries, Amateur Theatricals, London, Macmillan, 1879.\n* Toyland, ''Trot\u2019s Journey and Other Poems and Stories'', New York, R.

There she took many of the characteristic portraits for which she is principally remembered, many of which include her adolescent daughters Isabella Grace, Clementina, and Florence Elizabeth.  The furniture and characteristic decor of an upper-class London home was removed in order to create mise-en-scene images and theatrical poses within the first floor of her home.

Her work was widely acclaimed for its \"artistic excellence\", winning her the medal for composition at the exhibition.  Hawarden was considered an amateur photographer and while appreciated for her work, never became widely known as a photographer.  Her photographic years were brief but prolific.  Hawarden produced over eight hundred photographs from 1857-1864 before her sudden death.  During this time she gave birth to three of her eight children.  Lady Hawarden's photographic focus remained on her children.  There is only one photograph believed to feature the Viscountess Hawarden, yet it could also be a portrait of her sister Anne Bontine.<ref name=mavor/>\n\n[[Lewis Carroll]], also a photographer, was an admirer of Hawarden's work.<ref>Leggatt, Robert. \"[http://www.rleggat.com/photohistory/history/hawarden.htm A History of Photography]\".</ref> Her work is also likened to [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], another Victorian female photographer.\n\nA collection of 775 portraits were donated to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London in 1939 by Hawarden's granddaughter, Clementina Tottenham. The photographs were ripped from family albums for reasons still unclear.  This accounts for the torn corners now characteristic of Hawarden's work.<ref name=mavor/>\n\nCarol Mavor writes extensively about the place of Hawarden's work in the history of Victorian photography as well as contemporary interpretations of the work.  She states, \"Hawarden's pictures raise significant issues of gender, motherhood, and sexuality as they relate to photography's inherent attachments to loss, duplication and replication, illusion, fetish.\" <ref name=mavor/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Hawarden-clem-maude-flo-1863-4.jpg|Hawarden-clem-maude-flo-1863-4\nFile:Clementina Hawarden, Clementina Maude.jpg|Clementina Hawarden, Clementina Maude\nFile:Hawarden-clementina-maude-1862-3-mirror.jpg|Hawarden-clementina-maude-1862-3-mirror\nFile:Hawarden1.jpg|Hawarden1\nFile:Clementina Hawarden, Clementina Maude and Isabella, 1861.jpg|Clementina Hawarden, Clementina Maude and Isabella, 1861\nFile:Lady Clementina Hawarden3.jpg|Lady Clementina Hawarden3\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Virginia Dodier.

She also published her [[Diary|journal]]s and various articles.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nSophia Amelia Peabody was born September 21, 1809, in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], and named after two of her aunts.<ref>Marshall, 68</ref> Peabody's father was the dentist Nathaniel Peabody, while her mother was the strong [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Elizabeth Palmer. She had three brothers; her sisters were [[Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]] and [[Mary Tyler Peabody Mann]], later [[Horace Mann]]'s wife. Her sister Elizabeth educated Sophia, focusing on geography, science, literature and both American and European history; eventually, she learned to read in Latin, French, Greek, Hebrew; she knew some German as well.<ref name=McFarland26>McFarland, 26</ref>\n\nSophia's health had been questionable since infancy and she was an occasional invalid. One possible cause was a fashionable treatment her dentist father prescribed for her [[teething]] pains that included [[mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name=McFarland26/> In later life, she was a frequent user of [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]] and [[opium]] to relieve her pain and migraines.<ref>Cheever, 186</ref> When doctors pronounced Sophia had no discernible illness, she sought the \"rest therapy\". She left for [[Cuba]] on December 4, 1833, with her sister Mary.<ref>Wineapple, 117</ref>\n\n===Courtship===\nSophia first met Nathaniel Hawthorne through her sister, Elizabeth. When the author came to visit once, Elizabeth is said to have reported, \"He is handsomer than [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]!\" When she urged Sophia to come downstairs to meet him, she laughed and said, \"If he has come once he will come again\".<ref>Wineapple, 102</ref> After meeting her, Nathaniel wrote the tale \"Edward Randolph\u2019s Portrait\", which included an artist character inspired by Sophia Peabody named Alice Vane.<ref>Marshall, 364</ref>\n\nSophia had originally objected to marriage, partly because of her health. They became secretly engaged by New Year's Day 1839.<ref>Marshall, 373</ref>\n\n[[Image:Villa Menaggio, Lago di Como.jpg|thumb|right|''Villa Menaggio, Lago di Como'' by Sophia Peabody, 1839\u201340]]\n\nSophia gave two of her paintings to Hawthorne in 1840 on the first anniversary of their engagement.  \"Hawthorne valued the paintings so much that he hid them behind curtains to enjoy when he was alone\".<ref name=\"Hawthorne\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawthorneinsalem.org/Life&Times/Family/Immediate/Images.html |title= Hawthorne in Salem|work= Images Related to The Immediate Family of Nathaniel Hawthorne |accessdate=July 15, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage and family===\nA wedding was scheduled for June 27, 1842, but was postponed when Sophia fell ill.<ref>Wineapple, 160</ref> On July 9, 1842, five years after first meeting, she and Nathaniel were married at 13 West Street in Boston, the Peabody bookstore where [[Margaret Fuller]] held some of her \"conversations\".<ref>Miller, 205</ref> The day before, Nathaniel wrote to [[James Freeman Clarke]] asking him to oversee the ceremony. \"I am to be married to Miss Sophia Peabody tomorrow; and it is our mutual desire that you should perform the ceremony\", he wrote.<ref>Mellow, 197</ref> Both were considered relatively old for marriage (she was 32 and he was five days past his 38th birthday), but the coupling proved happy for both of them. Immediately after their wedding, they rented and moved into [[The Old Manse]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. The next day, Hawthorne wrote to his sister Louisa: \"We are as happy as people can be, without making themselves ridiculous, and might be even happier; but, as a matter of taste, we choose to stop short at this point.\"<ref>Mellow, 198</ref> Together the couple etched their impressions of their new married life in the glass of a window in the study using Sophia's diamond ring:\n<blockquote>Man's accidents are God's purposes. Sophia A. Hawthorne 1843<br>\nNath Hawthorne This is his study<br>\nThe smallest twig leans clear against the sky<br>\nComposed by my wife and written with her diamond<br>\nInscribed by my husband at sunset, April 3, 1843. In the Gold light.<br>\nSAH<ref>Cheever, 174</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn their first wedding anniversary, Nathaniel wrote to Sophia: \"We were never so happy as now\u2014never such wide capacity for happiness, yet overflowing with all that the day and every moment brings to us. Methinks this birth-day of our married life is like a cape, which we have now doubled and find a more infinite ocean of love stretching out before us.\"<ref>Miller, 228</ref>\n\n[[Image:Hawthorne children mmd368 l.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of Una, Julian and Rose Hawthorne c.1862]]\nThe Hawthornes' first child was born March 3, 1844, after a difficult 10-hour delivery.<ref>Mellow, 239</ref> They named her Una, a reference to ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by [[Edmund Spenser]], to the disapproval of many family members.<ref>McFarland, 97</ref> Sophia wrote in her journal, \"It was a great happiness to be able to put her to my breast immediately and I thanked Heaven I was able to have the privilege of nursing her.\"<ref>Mellow, 240\u2013241</ref> [[John L. O'Sullivan]] served as her [[godparent|godfather]] and gave her a [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland dog]] named Leo when she was two months old.<ref>Miller, 229</ref> Nathaniel wrote that fatherhood brought \"a very sober and serious kind of happiness\"<ref>Mellow, 240</ref> and the family began to worry about money. Sophia also had a recurrence of her migraines after Una's birth.<ref>Mellow, 241</ref>\n\nThe family was soon kicked out of the Old Manse, left with only 10 dollars. They moved in with  family on Herbert Street in Salem while Nathaniel awaited a government job appointment.<ref>McFarland, 132</ref> In March 1846, Sophia moved to 77 Carver Street in Boston to be closer to family and Dr. William Wesselh\u0153ft while pregnant with her second child.<ref>Miller, 258</ref> The couple's son [[Julian Hawthorne|Julian]] was born in Boston on May 22, 1846. His father wrote of the news to a sister, \"A small [[caveman|troglodyte]] made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o'clock this morning, who claims to be your nephew\".<ref>Mellow, 273</ref>\n\nThe family moved to [[Lenox, Massachusetts]], and it was there, in a red farmhouse they rented, that Sophia gave birth to her third child, [[Mother Mary Alphonsa|Rose]]. Two months prior to giving birth, Sophia claimed she instinctively knew it would be a girl and chose the name Rose.<ref name=Miller343>Miller, 343</ref> She was born on May 20, 1851, about a month after the publication of ''[[The House of the Seven Gables]]''.<ref>Wineapple, 240</ref> Sophia went into labor early, before the [[midwifery|midwife]] could arrive; Rose was delivered with the help of Sophia's father.<ref name=Miller343/>\n\nFew of Sophia's letters from her courtship and early marriage survive. In June 1853, Nathaniel alludes to the destruction of his letters in his journal: \"I burned great heaps of old letters and other papers, a little while ago, preparatory to going to England. Among them were hundreds of Sophia's maiden letters\".<ref>McFarland, 197</ref>\n\nHawthorne in 1862 praised his wife: \"She is the most sensible woman I ever knew in my life, much superior to me in general talent, and of fine cultivation.\"<ref>Miller, 34</ref> Sophia had a close friendship with [[Annie Adams Fields]], wife of the publisher [[James Thomas Fields]]. In 1863, Sophia wrote to her, \"You embellish my life.\"<ref>Wineapple, 354</ref>\n\nNathaniel Hawthorne died in May 1864 and Sophia was given the news by her sister [[Elizabeth Peabody]], who had been informed by [[Franklin Pierce]]. Pierce, a close friend of Hawthorne, had been at the author's side when he died in his sleep.<ref>Miller, 518</ref> Sophia wrote about her husband's death to Annie Fields: \"My darling has gone over that Sapphire sea, and these grand soft waves are messages from his Eternal Rest.\"<ref>McFarland, 298</ref> She moved to England four years later in 1868 with her three children.\n\n===Later life, death, burial, and reburial===\n[[Image:Sophia Peabody Hawthorne 2.png|thumb|left|Portrait of Sophia Peabody Hawthorne]]\n\nAfter her husband's death, Sophia threatened to sue publisher [[James Thomas Fields]] for not paying enough in royalties from book sales. Fields blamed his recently deceased business partner [[William Ticknor]] for promising \"to pay the highest rate of copyright it ever paid\" but that no written contract existed. The two agreed to a compromise as, Sophia said, she preferred \"peace to pence\".<ref>Madison, Charles A. ''Irving to Irving: Author-Publisher Relations 1800\u20131974''. New York: R. R. Bowker Company, 1974: 17.</ref>\n\nSophia became ill in February 1871, diagnosed with \"typhoid pneumonia\". She had difficulty breathing and was cared for by her daughters before dying on February 26. She was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in London on March 4. Una wrote to Julian that their mother's grave was \"on a sunny hillside looking towards the east... We had a head and footstone of white marble, with a place for flowers between, and Rose and I planted some ivy there that I had brought from America, and a periwinkle from papa's grave. The inscription is\u2014''Sophia, wife of Nathaniel Hawthorne''.\"<ref name=Mellow586>Mellow, 586</ref>\n\n[[Image:SophiaHawthorneGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Sophia Hawthorne in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]]\n\nUna died in September 1877 at the age of 33 and was buried alongside her mother in Kensal Green.<ref name=Mellow586/> [[Julian Hawthorne]] went on to be a moderately successful author writing about his father and other miscellaneous works.  He died in 1934. [[Rose Hawthorne Lathrop|Rose]] went on to found the [[Roman Catholic]] order of nuns, the [[Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne]], based in [[Hawthorne, New York]], where she died in 1926.\n\nCare for the graves of Sophia and Una fell to this organization. When the grave sites were in need of costly repair, it was suggested the remains be moved to the Hawthorne family plot in [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. In June 2006 the two were re-buried alongside Nathaniel in [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (Concord, Massachusetts)|Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]]. A funeral was held for the family's descendants with representatives from the Dominican Sisters and a public ceremony was held at [[The Old Manse]] to mark the occasion.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/01/hawthornes_to_be_reunited/ ''Boston Globe'' article on reburial]</ref>\n\n==Artwork==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[Image:Isola San Giovanni.jpg|thumb|''Isola San Giovanni'' by Sophia Peabody, 1839\u201340]]\nSophia Peabody Hawthorne was also an artist. She purposefully took up drawing in 1829 and attended drawing parties which copied the works of other artists.<ref>Marshall, 206</ref> She briefly studied sculpture with [[Shobal Vail Clevenger]] and produced a bas-relief medallion portrait of her dying brother George Peabody and, shortly thereafter, a similar work of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s dead brother Charles.<ref>Mellow, 173</ref> Later, she tutored her daughter Rose in art.<ref>Wineapple, 8</ref>\n\nDuring their courtship, Sophia created an illustration for Nathaniel's tale \"The Gentle Boy\". After completing it, Sophia asked him if it looked like the main character, Ilbrahim. He answered, \"He will never look otherwise to me\".<ref>Mellow, 157</ref> The story was republished with Sophia's illustration as ''The Gentle Boy: A Thrice Told Tale'' in December 1838,<ref>Wineapple, 127</ref> subsidized by a Salem hostess named Susan Burley.<ref>Marshall, 371</ref> The book was dedicated to Sophia, inscribed: \"To Miss Sophia A. Peabody, this little tale, to which her kindred art has given value, is respectfully inscribed by the author\".<ref>Marshall, 372</ref> When Nathaniel moved to Boston, Sophia painted two landscapes to decorate his apartment. On January 2, 1840, he wrote to her, \"You cannot think how much delight those pictures are going to give me... I never owned a picture in my life.\"<ref>Mellow, 171</ref> He later asked her to illustrate a reissue of his children's book ''Grandfather's Chair''.<ref>Marshall, 417</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Cheever, Susan.

She grew up in [[Whittingehame House]], [[East Lothian]], [[Scotland]], and travelled widely during her childhood.  She took drawing lessons but had no other formal art education.\n\nShe met [[Henry Arthur Herbert (1815\u20131866)|Henry Arthur Herbert]] while abroad in Rome and married him in September, 1837.  His family owned the [[Muckross House|Muckross]] Estate near [[Killarney]] in [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]], and they moved there to Torc Cottage after their wedding.

They were Eleanor, Henry Arthur, Charles, and Blanche.  Mary put much effort into raising funds for the famine-stricken inhabitants of the estate, but she lived away from the estate, in England.\n\nShe also worked at developing her talents as a watercolour artist, and she displayed considerable skill with practice.  She painted many scenes from the [[Lakes of Killarney]] and was recognised as the ''\"...most gifted amateur in the kingdom.\"''(The Times, Friday, August 30, 1861.)  [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] visited the estate with the Royal family in 1861 and received several of Mary's paintings as a parting gift.\n\nHenry died in 1866 and was interred in the family vault at Killegy graveyard near [[Muckross House]], and Mary then moved back to England with her two daughters. She was able to rekindle many of her old friendships with people notable in art at the time, including [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who was a close friend of the well-known artist [[William Morris]].\n\nAfter her oldest daughter Eleanor's marriage in 1871, Mary moved to [[Bellagio (Italian region)|Bellagio]], [[Italy]], near [[Lake Como]] and continued her artwork there. She died in London in 1893 and was buried with her husband in Killegy graveyard.

In 1929 she joined the [[Seven and Five Society]] and worked alongside younger artists including [[Barbara Hepworth]], [[Ben Nicholson]] and [[Henry Moore]]. In 1930, it is said, she was the person who finally \"goaded\" her friend [[Lucy Wertheim]] into opening her gallery in London to exhibit \"artists who had not yet arrived\".<ref>{{cite news | title=Mrs Lucy Wertheim Ecouraging Young Artists | date=15 December 1971 | newspaper=The Times | location = London }}</ref> During the 1930s Hodgkins exhibited with many important London galleries and gained a contract from the Lefevre Gallery to produce work for a full-scale exhibition every second year.

She was a delicate child, and was encouraged by her father, physician Hiram Hosmer, to pursue a course of physical training by which she became expert in rowing, skating, and riding. She traveled alone in the wilderness of the western United States, and visited the [[Lakota people|Dakota Indians]].<ref name=acab>{{Appletons'|wstitle=Hosmer, Harriet|year=1892|inline=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=MacLean|first1=Maggie|title=Harriet Hosmer: One of the First Women Artists in the United States|url=http://civilwarwomenblog.com/harriet-hosmer/|website=CIvil War Women|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nShe showed an early aptitude for modeling, and studied anatomy with her father. Through the influence of family friend [[Wayman Crow]] she attended the anatomical instruction of Dr. Joseph Nash McDowell at the [[Missouri Medical College]] (then the medical department of the state university).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hosmer|first=Harriet Goodhue|title=Harriet Hosmer letters and memories|year=1912|publisher=Moffat, Yard and Company|location=New York|page=8}}</ref>  She then studied in [[Boston]] and practiced modeling at home until November 1852, when, with her father and her friend [[Charlotte Cushman]], she went to [[Rome]], where from 1853 to 1860 she was the pupil of the Welsh sculptor [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]].<ref name=acab/>\n\n{{Quote|text=When Hosmer knew herself to be a sculptor, she knew also that in America was no school for her.  She must leave home, she must live where art could live.  She might model her busts in clay of her own soil, but who should follow out in marble the delicate thought which the clay expressed?  The workmen of Massachusetts tended the looms, built the railroads, and read the newspapers.  The hard-handed men of Italy worked in marble from the designs put before them; one copied the leaves which the sculptor threw into the wreaths around the brows of his heroes; another turned with the tool the folds of the drapery; another wrought up the delicate tissues of the flesh; none of them dreamed of ideas - they were copyists - the very hand-work that her head needed.

Women were not allowed to have the same art education as men, they were not trained in the making \"great\" art such as large history paintings, mythological and biblical scenes, modeling of figure.  Women usually produced artwork that could be done in their home, such as still lives, portraits, landscapes, and small scale carvings, although even [[Queen Victoria]] allowed her daughter, the [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]], to study sculpture.\n\nHosmer was not allowed to attend art classes, because working from a live model was forbidden for women, she took classes in anatomy to learn the human form and paid for private sculpture lessons. The biggest career move she made was moving to Rome to study art. Hosmer owned her own studio and ran her own business. She became a well-known artist in Rome, and received several commissions. \n\n==Legacy==\n[[Mount Hosmer (Iowa)|Mount Hosmer]], near [[Lansing, Iowa]] is named after Hosmer; she won a footrace to the summit of the hill during a steamboat layover during the 1850s.<ref>Sherwood, Dolly, \u2018\u2019Harriet Hosmer, American Sculptor: 1830-1908\u2019\u2019 University of Missouri Press, Columbia MO, 1991 p. 31</ref>\n\nA book of poetry, ''Waking Stone: Inventions on the Life Of Harriet Hosmer'', by Carole Simmons Oles, was published in 2006.\n\nHer sculpture, ''Puck and Owl'', is featured on the [[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Downtown|url=http://bwht.org/downtown/#6|website=Boston Women's Heritage Trail}}</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Beatrice Cenci Front by Hosmer.jpg|thumb|H.

Her paintings, mainly portraits of anonymous female sitters, are rendered in a range of closely related tones. Although she was overshadowed during her lifetime by her brother [[Augustus John]], her reputation has grown steadily since her death.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Vase of Flowers - Gwen John.jpg|thumb|''Vase of Flowers'' (ca. 1910s)]]\nGwen John was born in [[Haverfordwest]], [[Wales]], the second of four children of Edwin William John and his wife Augusta (n\u00e9e Smith). Gwen's elder brother was Thornton John; her younger siblings were Augustus and Winifred.<ref>Langdale 1987</ref> Edwin John was a solicitor whose dour temperament cast a chill over his family, and Augusta was often absent from the children owing to ill health, leaving her two sisters\u2014stern [[Salvation Army|Salvationists]]\u2014to take her place in the household.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 3.</ref> Augusta was an amateur watercolourist, and both parents encouraged the children's interest in literature and art.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 4.</ref> Her mother died when she was eight years of age. Regarding her mother's death and the loss of her influence, her brother, [[Augustus John|Augustus]], later wrote: \"My mother would no doubt have been helpful, but she died when I was a small child, after, I fear, a very tearful existence.\"<ref name=\"Tamboukou p. 4\">Tamboukou, p. 4.</ref>\n\nFollowing the mother\u2019s premature death in 1884, the family moved to [[Tenby]] in [[Pembrokeshire]], Wales, where the early education of Gwen and her sister Winifred was provided by governesses.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 5.</ref> Aside from her sister, she also had two brothers, Thornton and Augustus. The siblings often went to the coast of Tenby to sketch. John said that she would make \"rapid drawings of beached gulls, shells and fish on stray pieces of paper, or sometimes in the frontispiece of the book she was reading.\"<ref name=\"Tamboukou p. 4\" /> Although she painted and drew from an early age, Gwen John's earliest surviving work dates from her nineteenth year.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Education==\nFrom 1895 to 1898, she studied at the [[Slade School of Art]], where the program was modeled after French atelier's methods.<ref>Foster 1999, p. 10.</ref> It was the only art school in the United Kingdom that allowed female students, although there was generally no mixing of men and women on the grounds, in classes, or in corridors.<ref>Tamboukou pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Like her younger brother, Augustus, who had begun his studies there in 1894,<ref>Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 9.</ref> she studied figure drawing under [[Henry Tonks]].<ref>Uglow, p. 284.</ref> During this period, she and Augustus shared living quarters, and further reduced their expenses by subsisting on a diet of nuts and fruit.<ref name=\"Langdale14\" /> She developed a close relationship with the woman who would become her brother's wife, [[Ida Nettleship]]. At this time, she also had a relationship with another of her brother's set, [[Arthur Ambrose McEvoy]], which turned out unhappy.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 22.</ref> Good friends also included [[Ursula Tyrwhitt]] and [[Gwen Salmond]].<ref name=\"Tamboukou p. 5\">Tamboukou, p. 5.</ref> Gwen John won the Melvill Nettleship Prize for Figure Composition in her final year at Slade.<ref name=\"Langdale14\" />\n\nSlade students were encouraged to copy the works of old masters in London museums.<ref name=\"Langdale_9\"/> Gwen John's early paintings such as ''Portrait of Mrs. Atkinson'', ''Young Woman with a Violin'', and ''Interior with Figures'' are intimist works painted in a traditional style characterised by subdued colour and transparent glazes.<ref name=\"Langdale_9\">Langdale 1987, p. 9.</ref>\n\nEven as a student, Augustus' brilliant draughtsmanship and personal glamour made him a celebrity, and stood in contrast to Gwen's quieter gifts and reticent demeanour. Augustus greatly admired his sister's work but believed she neglected her health, and urged her to take a \"more athletic attitude to life\".<ref name=\"Langdale14\" /> She refused his advice, and  demonstrated throughout her life a marked disregard for her physical well-being.<ref name=\"Langdale14\">Langdale 1987, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn 1898 she made her first visit to [[Paris]] with two friends from the Slade, and while there she studied under [[James McNeill Whistler]] at his school, Acad\u00e9mie Carmen. She returned to [[London]] in 1899, and  exhibited her work for the first time in 1900, at the [[New English Art Club]] (NEAC).<ref name=\"Tamboukou p. 5\" /><ref>Foster 1999, p. 77.</ref> Her material circumstances were poor, and in 1900\u201301 she lived as a [[squatter]] in a  derelict building.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 21 and note, p. 125.</ref>\n\n==France and early career==\n[[Image:Gwen John - Self-Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|''Self-Portrait'' (1902)]]\nIn the autumn of 1903, she travelled to France with her friend [[Dorelia McNeill]] (who would later become Augustus John's second wife). Upon landing in [[Bordeaux]], they set off on a walking tour with their art equipment in hand, intending to reach [[Rome]]. Sleeping in fields and living on money earned along the way by selling portrait sketches, they made it as far as [[Toulouse]].<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 24.</ref> In 1904 the two went to Paris, where John found work as an artist's model, mostly for women artists. In that same year, she began modelling for the sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]], and became his lover. Her devotion to the much older Rodin, who was the most famous artist of his time, continued unabated for the next ten years, as documented in her thousands of fervent letters to him. Gwen John was given to fierce attachments to both men and women that were sometimes disturbing to them,<ref>Langdale 1987, p.15.</ref> and Rodin, despite his genuine feeling for her, eventually resorted to the use of conci\u00e8rges and secretaries to keep her at a distance.<ref>Langdale 1987, pp. 31\u201333.</ref>\n\nDuring her years in Paris she met many of the leading artistic personalities of her time, including [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i|Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]],<ref>Foster 1999, p. 29.</ref> but the new developments in the art of her time had little effect on her, and she worked in solitude.<ref>Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 17.</ref> In 1910 she found living quarters in [[Meudon]], a suburb of Paris where she would remain for the rest of her life. As her affair with Rodin drew to a close, Gwen John sought comfort in [[Catholicism]], and around 1913 she was received into the Church.<ref name=\"Langdale50\">Langdale 1987, p. 50.</ref> Her notebooks of the period include meditations and prayers; she wrote of her desire to be \"God's little artist\"<ref>Foster 1999, p. 52.</ref> and to \"become a saint.\"<ref name=\"Langdale50\" /> In an often-quoted letter of ca. 1912, she wrote: \"As to whether I have anything worth expressing that is apart from the question. I may never have anything to express, except this desire for a more interior life\".<ref name=\"Langdale_et_al_12\">Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986,  p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Gwen John - M\u00e8re Poussepin (Barber Institute).jpg|thumb|right|''M\u00e8re Poussepin'', ca. late 1910s, [[Barber Institute]], Birmingham]]\nShe stopped exhibiting at the NEAC in 1911, but gained an important patron in [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], an American art collector who, from 1910 until his death in 1924, purchased the majority of the works that Gwen John sold.<ref name=\"Foster26\">Foster 1999, p. 26.</ref> Quinn's support freed John from having to work as a model, and enabled her to devote herself to her work. Although she participated in exhibitions fairly regularly, her perfectionism produced in her a marked ambivalence toward exhibiting. She wrote in 1911: \"I paint a good deal, but I don't often get a picture done\u2014that requires, for me, a very long time of a quiet mind, and never to think of exhibitions.\"<ref name=\"Langdale_et_al_12\" /> In 1913, one of her paintings was included in the seminal [[Armory Show]] in New York, which Quinn assisted in organising.<ref>Quinn had sent John a telegram requesting \"Four (or three) Gwen John\"; her reply was \"One Gwen John\". Schwartz 2001, p. 37.</ref>\n\nHer attitude toward her work was both self-effacing and confident. After viewing an exhibition of watercolours by [[C\u00e9zanne]] she remarked: \"These are very good, but I prefer my own.\"<ref name=\"Langdale_1\">Langdale 1987, p. 1.</ref>\n\nAbout 1913, as an obligation to the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Sisters of Charity at Meudon, she began a series of painted portraits of [[Marie Poussepin|M\u00e8re Marie Poussepin]] (1653\u20131744), the founder of their order. These paintings, based on a prayer card, established a format\u2014the female figure in three-quarter length seated pose\u2014which became characteristic of her mature style.<ref name=\"LJJ41\">Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 41.</ref> She painted numerous variants on such subjects as ''Young Woman in a Spotted Blue Dress'', ''Girl Holding a Cat'', and ''The Convalescent''. The identities of most of her models are unknown.\n\nIn Meudon she lived in solitude, except for her cats. In an undated letter she wrote, \"I should like to go and live somewhere where I met nobody I know till I am so strong that people and things could not effect me beyond reason.\"<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 2.</ref> She wished also to avoid family ties (\"I think the family has had its day. We don't go to Heaven in families now but one by one\")<ref>Schwartz 2001, p. 36.</ref> and her decision to live in France after 1903 may have been the result of her desire to escape the overpowering personality of her famous brother, although, according to art historian David Fraser Jenkins, \"there were few occasions when she did anything against her will, and she was the more ruthless and dominating of the two.\"<ref>Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 36.</ref>\n\nJohn exhibited in Paris for the first time in 1919 at the [[Salon d'Automne]], and exhibited regularly until the mid-1920s, after which time she became increasingly reclusive and painted less.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 80.</ref> She had only one solo exhibition in her lifetime, at the New Chenil Galleries in London in 1926.<ref>Schwartz 2001, p. 36; Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 16.</ref> In that same year she purchased a bungalow in Meudon. In December 1926, distraught after the death of her old friend Rilke, she met and sought religious guidance from her neighbor,  the neo-Thomist philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]]. She also met Maritain's sister-in-law, V\u00e9ra Ouman\u00e7off,  with whom she formed  her last romantic relationship, which lasted until 1930.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 81.</ref>\n\nGwen John's last dated work is a drawing of 20 March 1933, and no evidence suggests that she drew or painted during the remainder of her life.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 116.</ref> On 10 September 1939, she wrote her will and then travelled to [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], where she collapsed and was hospitalized. She died there on 18 September 1939 and was buried in Janval Cemetery.<ref name=walesonline150420>{{cite news|publisher=Wales Online|date=20 April 2015|title=Gwen John memorial plaque unveiled at her final resting place - the French town of Dieppe|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/gwen-john-memorial-plaque-unveiled-9083018|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Art ==\n[[Image:Gwen John - The Convalescent.jpg|thumb|right|''The Convalescent'' (ca. 1923\u201324), one of ten versions she painted of this composition]]\n\nIn 1916, Gwen John wrote in a letter: \"I think a picture ought to be done in 1 sitting or at most 2. For that one must paint a lot of canvases probably and waste them.\"<ref>Foster 1999, p. 58.</ref> Her surviving oeuvre is comparatively small, comprising 158 known oil paintings<ref>Langdale 1987, p. 122.</ref> which rarely exceed 24 inches in height or width. The majority are portraits, but she also painted still lifes, interiors and a few landscapes. She wrote, \"...a cat or a man, its the same thing ... its an affair of volumes ... the object is of no importance.\"<ref name=\"Langdale_1\"/> Although she lived in France from the age of 28 until she died, her work always displayed a British sensibility.<ref name=Langdale14 />\n\nHer early paintings, such as the ''Portrait of the Artist's Sister Winifred'' (ca. 1897\u201398) and ''Dorelia in a Black Dress'' (1903\u201304), are painted using thin [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s in the traditional manner of the old masters. Beginning with her series of paintings of M\u00e8re Poussepin (ca. 1913), her style is characterised by thicker paint appled in small, mosaic-like touches.<ref>Foster 1999, p. 57.</ref> It became her habit to paint the same subject repeatedly. Her portraits are usually of anonymous female sitters seated in a three-quarter length format, with their hands in their laps. One of her models, Jeanne Foster, wrote of John: \"She takes down my hair and does it like her own ... she has me sit as she does, and I feel the absorption of her personality as I sit\".<ref name=\"LJJ41\" />\n\nJohn's drawings number in the thousands.<ref>Langdale 1987, p. vi.</ref> In addition to studio work, she made many sketches and [[watercolor painting|watercolour]]s of women and children in church. Unlike her oil paintings of solitary women, these sketches frequently depict their subjects from behind, and in groups. She also made many sketches of her cats. Aside from two [[etching]]s she drew in 1910, she made no prints.<ref name=\"Langdale_et_al_12\" />\n\nHer notebooks and letters contain numerous personal formulae for observing  nature, painting a portrait, designating colors by a system of numbers, and the like. Their meaning is often obscure, but they reveal John's predilection for order and the lasting influence of Whistler, whose teaching emphasised systematic preparation.<ref>Langdale 1987, pp. 17\u201321.</ref>\n\nGwen John's art, in its quietude and its subtle colour relationships, stands in contrast to her brother's far more vivid and assertive work. Though she was once overshadowed by her popular brother, critical opinion now tends to view Gwen as the more talented of the two.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cumming | first = Laura | title = Swing out, sister: Tate Britain invites us to keep up with the Johns, but there is only one winner in this tale of sibling rivalry | work = The Observer | pages = 10 | date =  2004-10-03}}</ref>  Augustus himself had predicted this reversal, saying \"In 50 years' time I will be known as the brother of Gwen John.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Prichard | first = Alun | coauthors = | title = Arts: Centrepiece: Scandal and seclusion | work = Daily Post (Liverpool) | pages = 4 | date =  2004-09-10 | url = }}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nJohn's pictures are held in many public collections.

Her photographs remain an important resource for modern architects, historians and conservationists. She exhibited a series of 247 photographs of [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], from the decaying mansions of the rich to the shacks of the poor, in 1928. The exhibition was entitled ''Pictorial Survey--Old Fredericksburg, Virginia--Old Falmouth and Nearby Places'' and described as \"A Series of Photographic Studies of the Architecture of the Region Dating by Tradition from Colonial Times to Circa 1830\" as \"An Historical Record and to Preserve Something of the Atmosphere of An Old Virginia Town.\"\n\nPublicity from the display prompted the [[University of Virginia]] to hire her to document its buildings and the state of [[North Carolina]] to record its architectural history. [[Louisiana]] hired Johnston to document its huge inventory of rapidly deteriorating plantations and she was given a grant in 1933 by the [[Carnegie Corporation]] of New York to document Virginia's early architecture. This led to a series of grants and photographs of eight other southern states, all of which were given to the Library of Congress for public use. Johnston was named an honorary member of the [[American Institute of Architects]] for her work in preserving old and endangered buildings and her collections have been purchased by institutions such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]. Although her relentless traveling was curtailed by petrol rationing in the [[Second World War]] the tireless Johnston continued to photograph. Johnston acquired a home in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]] in 1940, retiring there in 1945, where she died in 1952 at the age of eighty-eight.<ref name=hmdb>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=51361\n| title = Frances Benjamin Johnston House\n| publisher = The Historical Marker Database\n| author = Barry Swackhamer\n| date = 2012-01-06\n| accessdate = 2012-04-30\n}}</ref><ref name=tlcf>{{cite web\n| url = http://tclf.org/pioneer/biography-frances-benjamin-johnston\n| title = Biography of Frances Benjamin Johnston\n| date = 2012-03-01\n| accessdate = 2012-04-30\n| author = Sam Watters\n| publisher = The Cultural Landscape Foundation\n}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Daniel, Pete & [[Raymond W.

Remembered primarily as an history painter, Kauffmann was a skilled portraitist, landscape and decoration painter. A contemporary of Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough]], she was one of the two female [[List of Royal Academicians|founding members]] of the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1768.{{r|ra}}\n\n== Early life ==\nKauffman was born at [[Chur]] in [[Graub\u00fcnden]], [[Switzerland]], where her father was working for the local bishop but grew up in [[Schwarzenberg, Austria|Schwarzenberg]] in [[Vorarlberg]]/[[Austria]] where her family originated. Her father, [[Joseph Johann Kauffmann]], was a relatively poor man but a skilled painter, who was often traveling for his work. It was he who taught his precocious daughter. Angelica, a child prodigy, rapidly acquired several languages from her mother, Cleophea Lutz, read incessantly and showed talent as a musician, but her greatest progress was in painting, and by her twelfth year she had become known as a painter, with bishops and nobles being her sitters.\n\nIn 1754 her father took her to [[Milan]]. Later visits to [[Italy]] of long duration followed. She became a member of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]] in 1762.{{r|roworth2}} In 1763 she visited [[Rome]], returning again in 1764. From Rome she passed to [[Bologna]] and [[Venice]], everywhere feted for her talents and charm.  Writing from Rome in August 1764 to his friend Franke, [[Winckelmann]] refers to her  popularity; she was then painting his picture, a half-length; of which she also made an [[etching]].  She spoke Italian as well as German, he says, and  expressed herself with facility in French and English - one result of the last-named accomplishment being that she became a popular portraitist for British visitors to Rome. \"She may be styled beautiful,\" he adds, \"and in singing may vie with our best virtuosi.\"\n\n== Years in Great Britain ==\n[[File:A Scene from Troilus and Cressida - Angelica Kauffmann.jpg|thumb|''Troilus and Cressida, Act V, Scene II'' (1789), one of her many [[Shakespeare]] tableaux. Engraved in 1795 for an edition of Shakespeare by the [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery]].]]\n\nWhile in Venice, Kauffman was persuaded by Lady Wentworth, the wife of the British ambassador, to accompany her to London. One of the first pieces she completed in London was a portrait of [[David Garrick]], exhibited in the year of her arrival at \"Mr Moreing's great room in [[Maiden Lane (London)|Maiden Lane]].\"  The rank of Lady Wentworth opened society to her, and she was everywhere well received, the royal family especially showing her great favor. Her firmest friend, however, was Sir Joshua Reynolds. In his pocket-book her name as \"Miss Angelica\" or \"Miss Angel\" appears frequently; and in 1766 he painted her, a compliment which she returned by her ''Portrait of Sir Joshua Reynolds''. Another instance of her intimacy with Reynolds is to be found in her variation of [[Guercino]]'s ''Et in Arcadia ego'', a subject which Reynolds repeated a few years later in his portrait of Mrs Bouverie and Mrs [[Crewe]].\n\nIn 1767 Kauffman was seduced by an imposter going under the name [[Count Frederick de Horn]], whom she married, but they were separated the following year.<ref>Concise Dictionary of Women Artists, Delia Gaze Routledge 2013</ref>  It was probably owing to Reynolds's good offices that she was among the signatories to the petition to the king for the establishment of the [[Royal Academy]].  In its first catalogue of 1769 she appears with \"R.A.\" after her name (an honor she shared with one other woman, [[Mary Moser]]); and she contributed the ''Interview of [[Hector]] and [[Andromache]]'', and three other classical compositions. She visited Ireland briefly in 1771, and undertook a number of portrait commissions, notably of [[Philip Tisdall]], the [[Attorney General for Ireland]], and his wife Mary. It appears that among her circle of friends was [[Jean-Paul Marat]], then living in London and practising medicine, with whom she may have had an affair.<ref>Jean-Paul Marat: Tribune of the French Revolution, Clifford D Conner, Pluto Press 2012</ref>\n\n[[File:Blustockings2.jpg|thumb|right|Kauffman (seated), in the company of other \"[[Blue Stockings Society (England)|Bluestockings]]\". Richard Samuel, 1778.]]\nHer friendship with Reynolds was criticized in 1775 by fellow Academician [[Nathaniel Hone the Elder|Nathaniel Hone]] in his satirical picture ''The Conjurer''. This attacked the fashion for Italianate [[Renaissance]] art, ridiculed Reynolds and included a nude caricature of Kauffman, later painted out by Hone. The work was rejected by the Royal Academy.\n\nFrom 1769 until 1782 Kauffman was an annual exhibitor with the Royal Academy, sending sometimes as many as seven pictures, generally on classical or allegoric subjects. One of the most notable was ''[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] expiring in the Arms of [[Francis I of France|Francis the First]]'' (1778).<ref>King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] had become a close friend of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] during the artist's last years, and [[Vasari]] records that the King held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died. Aside from Kauffman, this story was portrayed in romantic paintings by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[:Image:DeathOfLeonardo.jpg|M\u00e9nageot]] and other French artists, though some historians consider it legend rather than fact.</ref>\n\nIn 1773 she was appointed by the Academy with others to decorate [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a scheme that was never carried out, and it was she who, with [[Biagio Rebecca]], painted the Academy's old lecture room at [[Somerset House]].\n\n==History painting==\n[[File:Angelica Kauffman - El juicio de Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Kauffman's ''El juicio de Paris'' at [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]]]\n\nWhile Kauffman produced many types of art, she identified herself primarily as a history painter, an unusual designation for a woman artist in the 18th century. [[History painting]] was considered the most elite and lucrative category in academic painting during this time period and, under the direction of Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], the Royal Academy made a strong effort to promote it to a native audience more interested in commissioning and buying portraits and landscapes. Despite the popularity that Kauffman enjoyed in British society, and her success there as an artist, she was disappointed by the relative apathy of the British towards history painting. Ultimately she left Britain for the continent, where history painting was better established, held in higher esteem and patronized.\n\n[[History painting]], as defined in academic art theory, was classified as the most elevated category. Its subject matter was the representation of human actions based on themes from history, mythology, literature, and scripture. This required extensive learning in biblical and Classical literature, knowledge of art theory and a practical training that included the study of anatomy from the male nude. Most women were denied access to such training, especially the opportunity to draw from nude models; yet Kauffman managed to cross the gender boundary to acquire the necessary skill to build a reputation as a successful history painter who was admired by colleagues and eagerly sought by patrons.<ref>Delia Gaze, Dictionary of Women Artists, vol. 2 (USA: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), 766</ref>\n\n== Later years in Rome ==\n[[File:Kauffmann Tragedy and Comedy (detail) 01.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''Tragedy and Comedy'', painted in Rome in 1791 ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]). Harmonious and powerful colours<ref name=Townsend/> and the soft-brushed, multi-layered style of English portraitists, Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough]],<ref name=Johns/> are typical for Kauffmann's paintings.]]\n\nIn 1781, after her first husband's death (she had been long separated from him), she married [[Antonio Zucchi]] (1728\u20131795), a [[Venice|Venetian]] artist then resident in Britain.\nShortly thereafter she retired to Rome, where she befriended, among others, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who said she worked harder and accomplished more than any artist he knew; yet, always restive, she wanted to do more<ref>Goethe, [[Italienische Reise|''Italian Journey'']], 1786\u20131788</ref> and lived for 25 years with much of her old prestige.\n\nIn 1782, Kauffman's father died, as did her husband in 1795. She continued at intervals to contribute to the Royal Academy in London, her last exhibit being in 1797. After this she produced little, and in 1807 she died in Rome, being honored by a splendid funeral under the direction of [[Canova]].  The entire [[Academy of St Luke]], with numerous ecclesiastics and virtuosi, followed her to her tomb in [[Sant'Andrea delle Fratte]], and, as at the burial of [[Raphael]], two of her best pictures were carried in procession.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe works of Angelica Kauffman have retained their reputation. By 1911, rooms decorated with her work were still to be seen in various quarters. At [[Hampton Court]] was a portrait of the duchess of Brunswick; in the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]], a self-portrait (NPG 430).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=ss&sText=Angelica+Kauffmann&LinkID=mp02473&rNo=0&role=sit|title=National Portrait Gallery - Portrait  - NPG 430; Angelica Kauffmann|work=npg.org.uk}}</ref> There were other pictures by her at Paris, at [[Dresden]], in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] at [[St Petersburg]], in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] at [[Munich]], in [[Kadriorg Palace]], [[Tallinn]] ([[Estonia]])<ref>{{cite web |url= http://digikogu.ekm.ee/eng/authors/author_id-559|title= Art Museum of Estonia|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref> and in the [[Universalmuseum Joanneum#Alte Galerie|Joanneum Alte Galerie]] at [[Graz]]. The Munich example was another portrait of herself, and there was a third in the [[Uffizi]] at Florence. A few of her works in private collections were exhibited among the [[Old Masters]] at [[Burlington House]].\n\nKauffman is also well known by the numerous engravings from her designs by [[Luigi Schiavonetti|Schiavonetti]], [[Francesco Bartolozzi]] and others. Those by Bartolozzi especially found considerable favour with collectors. [[Charles Willson Peale]] (1741\u20131827), artist, patriot, and founder of a major American art dynasty, named several of his children after notable European artists, including a daughter, Angelica Kauffman Peale.\n\nA biography of Kauffman was published in 1810 by {{Ill|it|Giovanni Gherardo De Rossi}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Documenting Anjelica Kauffman's Life and Art|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ecs/summary/v037/37.3roworth.html|publisher=JHU Journals|accessdate=31 January 2013}}</ref> The book was also the  basis of a romance by [[L\u00e9on de Wailly]] (1838) and it prompted the novel contributed by [[Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie|Anne Isabella Thackeray]] to the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' in 1875 entitled \"Miss Angel\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:A Kauffman Esop and Rodope.jpg| [[Francesco Bartolozzi|F.

Her mother was Dorothea Mattilda Tolle. Anna was the eldest of eight children, five of whom lived to maturity. Among her siblings were the astronomer [[Dorothea Klumpke|Dorothea Klumpke-Roberts]], the violinist [[Julia Klumpke]], and the neurologist [[Augusta D\u00e9jerine-Klumpke]].\nAt age three, Anna fell and suffered a fracture of her femur. She fell again at age five and suffered [[osteomyelitis]] with purulent knee [[arthritis]]. These problems handicapped her, and her mother went to extraordinary lengths to find a remedy by taking Anna and three of her siblings to [[Berlin]] for treatment by Dr. [[Bernhard von Langenbeck]].\n\nThe treatment lasted 18 months and included thermal baths at [[Kreuznach]]. Unfortunately, it was not successful, and Anna remained hobbled all her life. While they were in Europe, her mother ensured that her children received excellent tutoring.\n[[File:Anna Elizabeth Klumpke.jpg|thumb|354px|left|Anna Klumpke in her studio]]\nThe time away in Europe strained the Klumpkes' relationship. When Anna was fifteen, her parents divorced. She and her siblings (now numbering five) moved with their mother to [[G\u00f6ttingen]], Germany, where they lived for a time with Mattilda's sister, who had married a German national. Anna and her sister Augusta were sent to school at Cannstatt, near [[Stuttgart]]. When she was seventeen, the family moved to Clarens, near [[Lake Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]] where she spent two years in a boarding school.\n\nAnna studied art at home for the next few years, and in October 1877, moved with her family once more to [[Paris]], where she was later enrolled in the [[Academie Julian|Julian Academy]] (1883\u20131884), under the tutelage of [[Tony Robert-Fleury]] and [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre|Jules Lefebvre]]. She spent many an hour copying paintings in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg]], including [[Rosa Bonheur]]'s ''[[Ploughing in the Nivernais]]''.<ref name=\"Waters1904\">{{cite book|last=Waters|first=Clara Erskine Clement|title=Women in the fine arts: from the seventh century B.C. to the twentieth century A.D.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v6wMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA197|accessdate=26 January 2015|year=1904|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and Company|page=197}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFs_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA340|title=Letters and Art: Anna Klumpke|work=Public Opinion|volume=29|issue=11|year=1900|page=340|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> At one point, she also studied under [[F\u00e9lix Dominique de Vuillefroy|Vuillefroy]]. She presented her first work at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1884, while still at the Academy, and she won the grand prize for outstanding student of the year. She exhibited regularly at the Salon for several more years. After completing her studies, she returned to the United States for a few years and taught in Boston. However, by 1889, she was back in Paris.\n\nAs a girl, Anna had been given a \"Rosa\" doll, styled after the French animal painter [[Rosa Bonheur]]\u2014so famous at the time that dolls were made in her image. From early childhood, Anna had been fascinated and inspired by the woman artist.<ref name=cantor>Lawrence J. Cantor & Company, [http://www.fineoldart.com/browse_by_essay.html?essay=333 \"Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, (1856\u20131942)\"]</ref>\n\nIntent on painting Bonheur's portrait, she met Rosa Bonheur on October 15, 1889, under the pretext of being the interpreter for a horse dealer. The two women were soon living together at Bonheur's estate in [[Thomery]], near [[Fontainebleau]], and their relationship endured until Bonheur's death in 1899.\n[[File:Anna Klumpke - Portrait of Rosa Bonheur (1898).jpg|thumb|||Anna Elizabeth Klumpke|Anna Klumpke, Portrait of Rosa Bonheur, 1898]]\nKlumpke was named as the sole heir to Bonheur's estate and oversaw the sale of Bonheur's collected works in 1900. She founded the Rosa Bonheur Prize at the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais]] and organized the Rosa Bonheur museum at the Fontainebleau palace.\n\nKlumpke was a meticulous diarist, publishing in 1908 a biography of Bonheur, ''Sa Vie Son Oeuvre'', based on her own diary and Bonheur's letters, sketches and other writings. In the book, which was not published in English until 1998, Klumpke told the story of Bonheur's life and related how she had met Bonheur, how they had fallen in love, and how she had become the artist's official portraitist and companion.\n\nFollowing Bonheur's death, Klumpke divided her time between France, Boston, and San Francisco, finally settling in San Francisco in the 1930s. During World War I, with her mother, she established a military convalescent hospital at her home in [[Thomery]].\n\nIn 1940, at the age of 84, Klumpke published her own autobiography ''Memoirs of an Artist''. She died in 1942 at the age of 86 years in her native San Francisco.<ref name=cantor/>\n\n==Style==\nAnna Klumpke was primarily a genre painter, often painting pastoral scenes featuring static figures, usually female. Her painting, ''Catinou Knitting,'' was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1887. This sentimental image proved highly popular in reproduction and is still sold in hand-painted copies.\n\n==Notable works==\n[[File:Anna Klumpke - Seated Woman with a Red Kerchief (1886).jpg|thumbnail|Seated Woman with a Red Kerchief (1886)]]\n[[File:'In the Wash-house' by Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, 1888.JPG|thumb|right||In the Wash-house, oil on canvas painting by Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, 1888, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Her parents gave great emphasis on education. At first, she learned how to draw, but also French and Italian, in the [[Ursuline High School, Ljubljana|Ursuline High School]] in her home town, where her teacher of drawing was Ida K\u00fcnl. When she was 16, she went with her father to Vienna, where she saw the paintings of old masters that inspired her. From 1879 to 1880, she studied in Vienna, and from 1880 to 1881 in Munich, where she copied the paintings at the gallery of the [[Vienna Academy of Arts|Academy of Arts]]. From 1882 to 1889, she continued her studies under [[Alois Erdtelt]].<ref name=\"Mena\u0161e\" /> In 1888, she participated for the first time in a public exhibition.<ref name=\"Mena\u0161e\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.arnes.si/finearts/kobilca/kobilca.html |title=Ivana Kobilca |work=Fine Arts and Slovenians |first1=Ljerka |last1=Mena\u0161e |first2=Luc |last2=Mena\u0161e |year=1979 |accessdate=18 March 2012 |publisher=National Gallery |location=Ljubljana}}</ref> At the following exhibition in Munich, her work was spotted and praised by the prominent German art historian [[Richard Muther (art historian)|Richard Muther]].<ref name=\"Mena\u0161e\" /> and then returned to Ljubljana. In 1890, she painted in [[Zagreb]]. In 1891 and 1892, she painted in Paris in the private school of [[Henri Gervex]]. She became an honorary member (''membre associ\u00e9e'') of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux Arts]].<ref name=\"\u0160elih2007\" /> In 1892, she also painted in [[Barbizon]]. In 1893, she returned to Ljubljana, visited [[Florence]] in 1894, and lived in Sarajevo from 1897 to 1905. From 1906 to 1914, she lived in Berlin, and then returned to Ljubljana. At the time of her death in 1926 in Ljubljana, she was described as the greatest [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] female painter.<ref name=\"Mastnak1970\" />\n\n== Works and meanings ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:Ivana Kobilca - Poletje.jpg|thumb|225px|left|''Summer'', 1889]]\nJudging by her social origin, way of living, ideals and work, she was an urban artist. She is one of Slovene [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]]s, who created their most important paintings in the 1880s. Kobilca's greatest tribute to Slovenian art was made during the time she lived abroad. Her greatest impact was on figural painting, especially [[portraits]] and paintings of typical people's lives in rustic or urban places. Since the time she had spent in [[Berlin]], her most important genre became [[floral]] [[still life]]. Her early work reflects characteristics of M\u00fcnchen studio-work. The main colors are dark and brownish, only the pastels are light and rosy. From 1889 onwards her painting became lighter with blue nuances, typical for Parisian art at the time.\n\nFrom here on, many artists took the next step that led into [[Impressionism]], but Ivana Kobilca did not. In the latest period of her work, her ability to create fresh and interesting paintings started to fade. With some exceptions, her works of that period are dull and impersonal.\n\nKobilca's best known paintings are ''Kofetarica'' (''Coffeemadam''), 1888; ''Citrarica'' (''Zitherist''), ''Likarice'' (''Women Ironers''), 1891; ''Holandsko dekle'' (''Dutch Girl''), ''Portret sestre Fani'' (''Portrait of Sister Fani''), 1889; and ''Poletje'' (''Summer''), 1889.  Her work is on display in all major European galleries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.int/slovenia/famous.html |title=Famous Slovenians |publisher=Permanent Mission of Slovenia to the United Nations |accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Ivana Kobilca - Kofetarica.jpg|thumbnail|Kofetarica (1888)]]\n==Commemoration==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:Ivana Kobilca - Parizanka s pismom.jpg|thumbnail|Ivana Kobilca - Parizanka s pismom]]\nAfter Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Kobilca was portrayed by [[Rudi \u0160panzel]] on the 5000 [[Slovenian tolar]] banknote.<ref name=\"\u0160i\u0161ka2012\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/history_national_events/twenty_years_of_national_currency/ |first=Marko |last=\u0160i\u0161ka |title=Twenty Years of National Currency |publisher=Government Communication Office, Republic of Slovenia |date=January 2012 |work=Www.ukom.gov.si}}</ref> It was in circulation from December 1993 until the introduction of [[euro]] in January 2007.<ref name=\"\u0160i\u0161ka2012\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsi.si/bankovci-in-kovanci/opis-bankovcev.asp?MapaId=445 |title=5000 SIT |publisher=Banka Slovenije [Bank of Slovenia] |year=2006 |accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons and category}}\n* [http://www.ng-slo.si/default.asp?id=28&prikaz=galerija_avtorja&avtor=116 Ivana Kobilca at National Gallery in Ljubljana] (in Slovene)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kobilca, Ivana}}\n[[Category:1861 births]]\n[[Category:1926 deaths]]\n[[Category:Slovenian realist painters]]\n[[Category:Slovenian women artists]]\n[[Category:Carniolan painters]]\n[[Category:People from Ljubljana]]\n[[Category:19th-century painters]]\n[[Category:20th-century Slovenian painters]]\n[[Category:19th-century women artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century women artists]]"}]},"49750830":{"pageid":49750830,"ns":0,"title":"Elisa Koch"},"40418425":{"pageid":40418425,"ns":0,"title":"Florence Koehler"},"44173642":{"pageid":44173642,"ns":0,"title":"Elise Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Koekkoek-Daiwaille"},"20479172":{"pageid":20479172,"ns":0,"title":"Catharine Hermine K\u00f8lle"},"422861":{"pageid":422861,"ns":0,"title":"K\u00e4the Kollwitz","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox artist\n| bgcolour      = \n| name          = K\u00e4the Kollwitz \n| image         =Kathe Kollwitz 1919.jpg\n| imagesize     = 200px\n| caption       = K\u00e4the Kollwitz, 1919\n| birth_name     = K\u00e4the Schmidt \n| birth_date     = {{birth date|1867|7|8|df=y}}\n| birth_place      = [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]])\n| death_date     = {{death date and age|1945|4|22|1867|7|8|df=y}}\n| death_place    = [[Moritzburg, Saxony|Moritzburg]], [[Province of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]\n| nationality   = [[Germany|German]]\n| field         = \n| training      = \n| movement      = [[Expressionism]]\n| works         = \n| patrons       =\n| spouse       = Karl Kollwitz\n| influenced by = [[Max Klinger]], [[Frans Masereel]]\n| influenced    = [[Nicolae Tonitza]], [[Banksy]]\n| awards        = \n}}\n'''K\u00e4the (Schmidt) Kollwitz''' ({{IPA-de|k\u025b\u02d0t\u0259 k\u0254lv\u026at\u0361s}}), (8 July 1867 \u2013 22 April 1945) was a [[Germany|German]] artist, who worked with [[drawing]], [[etching]], [[lithography]], [[woodcuts]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], and [[sculpture]].

Zigrosser, Carl: ''Prints and Drawings of K\u00e4the Kollwitz'', page XIII. Dover, 1969.</ref> Kollwitz was the first woman elected to the [[Prussia]]n [[Akademie der K\u00fcnste|Academy of Arts]].\n\n==Life and work==\n\n===Youth===\nKollwitz was born in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia), [[East Prussia]], the fifth child in her family. Her father, Karl Schmidt, was a radical Social democrat who became a mason and house builder. Her mother, Katherina Schmidt, was the daughter of [[Julius Rupp]], a Lutheran pastor who was expelled from the official [[Evangelical State Church in Prussia]] and founded an independent congregation. Her education was greatly influenced by her grandfather's lessons in religion and socialism.\n\nRecognizing her talent, Kollwitz's father arranged for her to begin lessons in drawing and copying plaster casts when she was twelve.<ref>Bittner, page 2.</ref> At sixteen she began making drawings of working people, the sailors and peasants she saw in her father's offices. Wishing to continue her studies at a time when no colleges or academies were open to young women, Kollwitz enrolled in an art school for women in [[Berlin]]. There she studied with [[Karl Stauffer-Bern]], a friend of the artist [[Max Klinger]]. The etchings of Klinger, their technique and social concerns, were an inspiration to Kollwitz.<ref>Kurth, Willy: ''K\u00e4the Kollwitz, Geleitwort zum Katalog der Ausstellung in der Deutschen Akademie der K\u00fcnste,'' 1951.</ref>\n\nAt the age of seventeen, Kollwitz became engaged to Karl Kollwitz, a medical student.<ref>Bittner, page 3.</ref> In 1888, she went to [[Munich]] to study at the Women's Art School, where she realized her strength was not as a painter, but a draughtsman. In 1890, she returned to K\u00f6nigsberg, rented her first studio, and continued to draw labourers.<ref name=\"Bittner, page 4\">Bittner, page 4.</ref>\n\nIn 1891, Kollwitz married Karl, by this time a doctor, who tended to the poor in Berlin, where the couple moved into the large apartment that would be Kollwitz's home until it was destroyed in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Bittner, page 4\"/> The proximity of her husband's practice proved invaluable:\n\n<blockquote>\"The motifs I was able to select from this milieu (the workers' lives) offered me, in a simple and forthright way, what I discovered to be beautiful.... People from the bourgeois sphere were altogether without appeal or interest. All middle-class life seemed pedantic to me. On the other hand, I felt the proletariat had guts. It was not until much later...when I got to know the women who would come to my husband for help, and incidentally also to me, that I was powerfully moved by the fate of the proletariat and everything connected with its way of life.... But what I would like to emphasize once more is that compassion and commiseration were at first of very little importance in attracting me to the representation of proletarian life; what mattered was simply that I found it beautiful.\"<ref>Fecht, Tom: ''K\u00e4the Kollwitz'': Works in Color, page 6. Random House, Inc., 1988.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Kollwitz.jpg|thumb|left|''Woman with Dead Child'', 1903 etching]]\n\n===Personal health===\nIt is believed Kollwitz suffered anxiety during her childhood due to the death of her siblings, including the early death of her younger brother, Benjamin.<ref>Bittner, pages 1-2.</ref> More recent research suggests that Kollwitz may have suffered from a childhood neurological disorder called [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]], commonly associated with migraines and sensory hallucinations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Drysdale |first=Graeme R. |url=http://jmb.rsmjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/rsmjmb;17/2/106?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=1&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=50&resourcetype=HWCIT |title=Kaethe Kollwitz (1867\u20131945): the artist who may have suffered from Alice in Wonderland Syndrome| journal=Journal of Medical Biography |volume=17 |pages=106\u201310 |date=May 2009|doi=10.1258/jmb.2008.008042|pmid=19401515|issue=2}}</ref>\n\n===''The Weavers''===\nBetween the births of her sons --- Hans in 1892 and Peter in 1896 --- Kollwitz saw a performance of [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]'s ''The Weavers'', which dramatized the oppression of the [[Silesia]]n weavers in Langenbielau and their failed revolt in 1844.<ref name=\"Bittner, page 4\"/> Inspired, the artist ceased work on a series of etchings she had intended to illustrate [[\u00c9mile Zola]]'s ''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'', and produced a cycle of six works on the weavers theme, three lithographs (''Poverty'', ''Death'', and ''Conspiracy'') and three etchings with [[aquatint]] and sandpaper (''March of the Weavers'', ''Riot'', and ''The End''). Not a literal illustration of the drama, the works were a free and naturalistic expression of the  workers' misery, hope, courage, and, eventually, doom.\n\nThe cycle was exhibited publicly in 1898 to wide acclaim. But when [[Adolf Menzel]] nominated her work for the gold medal of the ''Gro\u00dfe Deutsche Kunstausstellung'' in Berlin, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] withheld his approval. Nevertheless, ''The Weavers'' became Kollwitz' most widely acclaimed work.<ref>Bittner, pages 4-5.</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===''Peasant War''===\nKollwitz's second major cycle of works was the ''Peasant War'', which, subject to many preliminary drawings and discarded ideas in lithography, occupied her from 1902 to 1908. The [[German Peasants' War]] was a violent revolution which took place in [[Southern Germany]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], beginning in 1525; peasants who had been treated as slaves took arms against feudal lords and the church. As was ''The Weavers'', this subject, too, might have been suggested by a Hauptmann drama, [[Florian Geyer]]. However, the initial source of Kollwitz's interest dated to her youth, when she and her brother Konrad playfully imagined themselves as barricade fighters in a revolution.<ref name=\"Bittner, page 6\">Bittner, page 6.</ref> The artist identified with the character of Black Anna, a woman cited as a protagonist in the uprising.<ref name=\"Bittner, page 6\"/> When completed, the ''Peasant War'' consisted of pieces in etching, aquatint, and soft ground: ''Plowing'', ''Raped'', ''Sharpening the Scythe'', ''Arming in the Vault'', ''Outbreak'', ''After the Battle'' (which, eerily premonitory, features a mother searching through corpses in the night, looking for her son), and ''The Prisoners''. In all, the works were technically more impressive than those of ''The Weavers'', owing to their greater size and dramatic command of light and shadow. They are Kollwitz's highest achievements as an etcher.<ref name=\"Bittner, page 6\"/>\n\nWhile working on ''Peasant War'', Kollwitz twice visited Paris, and enrolled in classes at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in order to learn how to sculpt.<ref>Bittner, pages 6-7. During this time she also visited Rodin twice.</ref> The etching ''Outbreak'' was awarded the Villa Romana prize, which provided for a year's stay, in 1907, in a studio in [[Florence]]. Although Kollwitz did no work, she later recalled the impact of early [[Renaissance]] art.<ref>''\"But there, for the first time, I began to understand Florentine art.\"''  Kollwitz, Kaethe: ''The Diaries and Letters of Kaethe Kollwitz'', page 45. Henry Regnery Company, 1955.</ref> \n[[File:Het treurende ouderpaar - K\u00e4the Kolwitz.JPG|thumb|''The Grieving Parents'', a memorial to Kollwitz's son Peter, in [[Vladslo German war cemetery]], Belgium.]]\n\n===Modernism and World War I===\nAfter her return, Kollwitz continued to exhibit her work, but was impressed by the work of younger compatriots&mdash;the [[Expressionism|Expressionists]] and (following the war) the [[Bauhaus]]&mdash;and resolved to simplify her means of expression.<ref>\"Nevertheless I am no longer satisfied. There are too many good things that seem fresher than mine... I should like to do the new etchings so that all the essentials are strongly stressed and the inessentials almost omitted.\" Kollwitz, page 52.</ref> Subsequent works such as ''Runover'', 1910, and ''Self-Portrait'', 1912, show this new direction. She also continued to work on sculpture.\n<gallery>\nFile:Peter-kollwitz.large.jpg|<center>|Peter Kollwitz\nFile:In_Flanders_Fields_Museum_Peter_Kollwitz_5-11-2015_16-59-29.JPG|<Center>|250px|Grave cross of Peter Kollwitz at the [[In Flanders Fields Museum]]\n</gallery>\n\nKollwitz lost her youngest son, Peter, on the battlefield in [[World War I]] in October 1914, prompting a prolonged depression. By the end of the year she had made drawings for a monument to Peter and his fallen comrades; she destroyed the monument in 1919 and began again in 1925.<ref>Bittner, page 9.</ref> The memorial, titled ''The Grieving Parents'', was finally completed and placed in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] cemetery of Roggevelde in 1932.<ref>\"I stood before the woman, looked at her&mdash;my own face&mdash;and wept and stroked her cheeks.\" Kollwitz, page 122.</ref> Later, when Peter's grave was moved to the nearby [[Vladslo German war cemetery]], the statues were also moved.\n\nIn 1917, on her 50th birthday, the galleries of [[Paul Cassirer]] provided a retrospective exhibition of one hundred and fifty drawings by Kollwitz.<ref>\"The elements of her nature and her art can often be felt more immediately in the drawings than in the prints, even much that in the latter has scarcely found a fulfillment.\" Kurth, Willy: ''Kunstchronik'', N.F., Vol. XXXVII, 1917.</ref>\n\nKollwitz was a committed [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Pacifism|pacifist]], who was eventually attracted to [[communism]]; her political and social sympathies found expression in the \"memorial sheet for [[Karl Liebknecht]]\" and in her involvement with the ''[[Arbeitsrat f\u00fcr Kunst]]'', a part of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] government in the first few weeks after the war. As the war wound down and a nationalistic appeal was made for old men and children to join the fighting, Kollwitz implored in a published statement:\n\n<blockquote>\"There has been enough of dying! Let not another man fall!\"<ref>Kollwitz, page 89.</ref></blockquote>\nWhile working on the sheet for Karl Liebknecht, she found etching insufficient for expressing monumental ideas. After viewing woodcuts by [[Ernst Barlach]] at the [[Secession]] exhibitions, she completed the Liebknecht sheet in the new medium and made about 30 woodcuts by 1926.<ref name=\"Bittner, page 10\">Bittner, page 10.</ref>\n\nIn 1920 Kollwitz was elected a member of the [[Prussia]]n [[Akademie der K\u00fcnste|Academy of Arts]], the first woman to be so honored.

Kr\u00f8yer (1890)]]\n'''Marie Triepcke Kr\u00f8yer Alfv\u00e9n''' (11 June 1867 \u2013 25 May 1940), commonly known as '''Marie Kr\u00f8yer''', was a Danish [[Painting|painter]]. She is remembered principally as the wife of [[P. S. Kr\u00f8yer]], one of the most successful members of the [[artists' colony]] known as the [[Skagen Painters]], which flourished at the end of the 19th century in the far north of [[Jutland]]. From an early age, Marie aspired to become an artist, and after training privately in Copenhagen she went to Paris to continue her studies. It was there, in early 1889, that she met Kr\u00f8yer, who immediately fell madly in love with her. Although he was sixteen years her senior, the couple married that summer and in 1891 settled in [[Skagen]]. Clearly inspired by Marie's beauty, Kr\u00f8yer had ample opportunity to paint her portraits both indoors and outdoors, especially on the beach. Married life became more difficult as Kr\u00f8yer experienced periods of mental illness from 1900, and Marie eventually began an affair with the Swedish composer [[Hugo Alfv\u00e9n]] who had also been taken by her beauty. The couple had a child, Marie divorced Kr\u00f8yer and moved to Sweden with Alfv\u00e9n. They married in 1912, but marital problems once again resulted in divorce. Marie was reluctant to paint after meeting Kr\u00f8yer, whom she looked up to as a far more competent artist, and she is remembered more as the subject of some of his best-known paintings than for her own work, although several of her pictures have recently attracted renewed interest. She is now also recognized for her significant contributions to design and [[architecture]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:En duet. (1887 painting).jpg|thumb|left|P.&nbsp;S. Kr\u00f8yer, ''A Duet'' (1887). Marie (left) appears here, but Kr\u00f8yer seems not to have been struck by her until they met in Paris.]]\nBorn in [[Frederiksberg]], Marie was the daughter of Max Triepcke, the technical director at the J.&nbsp;H. Rubens Loomery, and his wife Minna Augusta Kindler, who had emigrated to Denmark from Germany in 1866. She enjoyed a comfortable, middle-class life growing up in the Triepcke home, along with her two brothers Wilhelm and Valdemar. A childhood schoolfriend, Ida Hirschsprung, brought Marie into social contact with Heinrich and Pauline Hirschsprung, Ida's aunt and uncle. [[Heinrich Hirschsprung]], a prominent businessman who ran a successful tobacco manufacturing business, was a patron of the arts and had shown an early interest in P.&nbsp;S. Kr\u00f8yer.<ref name=\"Svanholm115\" />\n\nFrom an early age, Marie showed a great interest in art, aspiring to become a painter. It was very difficult in those days for women to train as artists, but she was talented and enjoyed the support of her parents. She studied privately under [[Carl Thomsen]] in the 1880s and was helped along the way by [[Bertha Wegmann]], a leading portrait artist of the day, for whom she modeled at sixteen years of age.<ref name=kvinfo>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/546/|author=Lise Svanholm|title=Marie Kr\u00f8yer (1867-1940)|publisher=Dansk kvindebiografisk leksikon|accessdate=8 September 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> As there were no public schools for female artists, Marie had the idea of saving on the expense of private tuition by gathering a group of other young aspiring women, renting a studio, and asking the best art teachers to come and give them occasional tips. Among the artists that sometimes stopped by were [[Laurits Tuxen]] and Marie's future husband, Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer, though Kr\u00f8yer was dismissive of the \"young lady painters\" school.<ref name=\"Svanholm115\">Svanholm 2004, p. 115</ref> In June 1888, Marie became engaged to Robert Hirschsprung, the son of Heinrich and Pauline, but he was prone to fits of deep depression and appears to have broken off the engagement soon afterwards.<ref name=\"Svanholm117\">Svanholm 2004, pp. 117-8</ref> In 1887, she paid her first brief visit to Skagen, but there are no records of works created by her on that occasion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/marie-kroeyer/|title=Marie Kr\u00f8yer|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=10 September 2014 }}</ref>\n  \nIn December 1888, Marie went to Paris where, in the spring of 1889, she studied side by side with [[Anna Ancher]] at the [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] atelier.<ref name=formerexhibs>{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/exhibitions/former-exhibitions/marie-kroeyer-alfven/|title=Marie Kr\u00f8yer Alfv\u00e9n \u2013 paintings, drawings, design|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=8 September 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> Anna Ancher, a fellow Dane from Skagen in the north of Jutland, became a lifelong friend.

Agnes would contribute a lifetime of support and encouragement for Marie's artistic pursuits.  Other friends with whom she maintained exhaustive correspondence include [[Georg Brandes]], critic and scholar, whom she admired, and the poet [[Sophus Schandorf]] and his wife, who treated Marie like a daughter.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Marriage with Kr\u00f8yer==\n{{See also|P.

She waved at Kr\u00f8yer, who was walking past, recognizing him from his occasional visits to the ladies' classes in Copenhagen and from the sittings when she modeled for the painting ''A Duet'' (1887). Kr\u00f8yer, who did not particularly remember her from Copenhagen, immediately fell madly in love with her. Following their engagement on 7&nbsp;May, they were married on 23&nbsp;July 1889 at the Triepke's home in [[Augsburg]], Germany.<ref name=kvinfo/> (The Triepkes had been forced to move back to Germany in 1888 on account of the father's loss of employment.) They spent their honeymoon in [[Stenbjerg]], a fishing village in the northwest of Jutland on the former island of [[Thy (district)|Thy]], avoiding the attention of the artists in Skagen. It was there that Kr\u00f8yer painted the first in a long series of portraits of his wife.<ref name=jp/>\n\nThey then traveled extensively in Italy where they visited [[Amalfi]] and [[Ravello]]. While she was there, Marie contracted typhoid, which discouraged her from doing much painting,<ref name=kvinfo/> though one surviving work of Marie's from this trip is a study of a little Italian girl. The couple returned to Denmark in December 1890. After periods spent in Copenhagen and [[Hornb\u00e6k]] they went to Skagen in May 1891. For the next few years, they spent their summers in Skagen and their winters in Copenhagen. While in Skagen, they first stayed in [[Br\u00f8ndums Hotel]], but from 1894 they rented a house in Skagens Vesterby,<ref name=jp/> and in 1895 they moved into a house of their own in Byfogedskoven. The summers Kr\u00f8yer spent with his wife in the 1890s were clearly a source of inspiration for him, especially as Marie had a strong sense of beauty herself, often quoting [[Keats]]' \"[[Ode on a Grecian Urn|Beauty is truth, truth beauty]]\".{{Sfn|Svanholm|2004|p=132}}\n\nHer marriage with Kr\u00f8yer apparently diminished Marie's ambitions to make a name for herself as a painter. Indeed, only one work can be said with certainty to have been painted by her in Skagen. Instead, she concentrated on enhancing their summer residence, designing various pieces of furniture, just as she did while they spent their winters at their home in Copenhagen's Bregensgade.<ref name=jp/>\n\nExactly what discouraged Marie from painting is not very clear, but there is little evidence she received any encouragement from Kr\u00f8yer. From her correspondence, it can be seen she lacked self-confidence and had problems with her health. She also appears to have suffered from post-natal depression after her daughter Vibeke was born in 1895. Several of her friends and associates described her as rather withdrawn, often complaining of headaches and retiring to bed, perhaps as a result of her marital problems.<ref name=jp/>\n\nWhile Vibeke was still a small child, Kr\u00f8yer's health started to deteriorate with bouts of mental illness, making the marriage increasingly difficult. In 1900, he was admitted to the mental hospital in [[Middelfart]], the first of many lengthy stays. The couple spent less and less time together and often travelled alone. It was during a visit Marie made to [[Taormina]], Sicily, in 1902 that she first met Hugo Alfv\u00e9n.<ref name=jp/>\n{{Gallery\n\n|width=220\n|height=220\n|lines=4\n| align = center\n| title     = Marie in P.

Kr\u00f8yer in 1903]] \nLong before he met Marie, Hugo Alfv\u00e9n had been struck by her beauty in Kr\u00f8yer's paintings. After seeing her portraits, he asserted: \"I had never seen a more beautiful woman and the grace and elegance of her figure left me utterly bewitched.\" While she was in Taormina with her daughter Vibeke, Marie wanted her friend the singer Anna Norrie to come and join her. As Norrie was staying with Alfv\u00e9n in Berlin, Marie invited both of them. Alfv\u00e9n, five years her junior, began to pursue her immediately, and Marie quickly succumbed. Their affair was so passionate that immediately after her trip to Italy, Marie went to Paris and asked Kr\u00f8yer for a divorce. Kr\u00f8yer refused, believing Marie had nothing more than a passing infatuation, and ordered her back to Skagen.<ref name=kvinfo/> Kr\u00f8yer was mistaken; the relationship persisted, and Marie never missed an opportunity to be together with Alfv\u00e9n in Skagen, Copenhagen or even Sweden. After she became pregnant in 1905, Kr\u00f8yer finally acquiesced to the demands for a divorce, but he maintained custody of Vibeke.<ref name=jp/> Most of Kr\u00f8yer's friends broke off contact with her when, as she wrote, she \"committed the inconceivably foolish act of leaving Kr\u00f8yer&nbsp;\u2013 that good, magnanimous and delightful man\"; only Michael and Anna Ancher remained her close friends.<ref name=\"Svanholm115\" />\n\n[[File:Marie Kr\u00f8yer with Margita in Alfvengaarden.jpg|thumb|left|Marie Kr\u00f8yer with Margita, Alfv\u00e9ngaard, c. 1912]]\nMarie's second daughter, Margita, was born in Copenhagen in 1905. She spent two years raising the child there until she joined Alfv\u00e9n in Sweden in 1907. Kr\u00f8yer, whose health had worsened since the divorce, died in Skagen in November 1909; Marie, now calling herself Marie Alfv\u00e9n, returned for the funeral although she had been asked to stay away.\n\nAlfv\u00e9n had first been hesitant to marry Marie, fearing repercussions on his career as a choirmaster.<ref name=kvinfo/> The wedding finally took place on 30 January 1912 in [[Uppsala]], after which the couple moved into a new house, \"Alfv\u00e9ngaard\", in [[T\u00e4llberg]]. Built entirely to her own design, Alfv\u00e9ngaard can be considered{{By whom|date=April 2015}} Marie Kr\u00f8yer's masterpiece, especially as she also created the furniture and interiors, and she designed a number of beautiful little buildings in the local style around the estate.<ref name=kvinfo/>\n\nOnce again, Marie had become a partner in an unhappy marriage. Even before the wedding, she had discovered Alfv\u00e9n had been unfaithful to her with a number of women, but she went ahead with the wedding anyway for Margita's sake. Alfv\u00e9n became increasingly unstable, requesting a divorce in 1928. Marie at first refused, but after ever more serious difficulties in their relationship and numerous courtroom disputes, the couple finally divorced in 1936.<ref name=rf2/> Alfv\u00e9ngaard, a major point of contention, was left to Margita while Marie moved to Stockholm where she lived alone for the remainder of her life.<ref name=kvinfo/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Paintings==\n[[File:MarieKroyer-selfportrait.jpg|thumb|Marie Kr\u00f8yer: Self-portrait (1889)]] \nWhile she was with Kr\u00f8yer, Marie painted little; she considered her talent inferior and felt frustrated that she could not commit herself fully to art because she had accepted that her role was to be a housewife and mother,<ref name=\"Svanholm142\">Svanholm 2004, p. 142-3</ref> saying: \"I sometimes think that the whole effort is in vain, we have far too much to overcome ... what significance does it really have if I paint, I shall never, never achieve anything really great ...

The paintings left by Vibeke, now in Skagens Museum, showed her mother was a fine painter who had possessed the unrealized potential to become one of Skagen's leading artists<ref name=rf2/> This was further evidenced in 2002, in connection with the publication of Tonni Arnold's book ''Kunsten i Marie Kr\u00f8yers liv'' (Art in Marie Kr\u00f8yer's Life), when an exhibition of some of her hitherto unknown works, 40 paintings and 20 sketches, was held in Copenhagen's [[Kunstforeningen]] after the author had tracked them down in Sweden. Arnold commented: \"It is quite clear she tried to succeed as a painter but circumstances were against her. After Kr\u00f8yer was hit by mental illness, she gave up... But now we know that for lengthy periods she seriously strove to be a painter, that she travelled on her own, and that something came out of it all.\"\n<ref name=jp>{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/kultur/se-marie-kroeyers-ukendte-billeder|title=Se Marie Kr\u00f8yers ukendte billeder|trans_title=See Marie Kr\u00f8yer's Unknown Pictures|publisher=''Berlingske''|author=Eva Pohl|date=1 May 2002|accessdate=9 September 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\nSeveral works by Marie Kr\u00f8yer are in the collection at Skagens Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/SoegKunstnerVaerker.do?kunstnerId=3784|title=Marie Kr\u00f8yer: V\u00e6rker af kunstneren p\u00e5 danske museer|trans_title=Marie Kr\u00f8yer: Works of the artist in Danish Museums|publisher=Kulturstyrelsen|accessdate=9 September 2014 }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Decorative talents==\nMarie Kr\u00f8yer was inspired by the Scottish designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] to design furniture.

On their return they were forced to sell their mansion, dismiss all but one servant,  and move to a small townhouse in [[Liverpool]].  At age 16, Anne took on many of the housekeeping duties and the care of her aging parents, while continuing her art work and training when possible.\n\nAfter further financial losses, the family moved to [[Bootle]], a small spa town north of Liverpool.  Anne continued to hone her artistic skills and to visit friends and relatives throughout Britain for access to landscapes to sketch.  She was also adept at painting miniatures in watercolor on ivory.\n[[File:Rosedale in 1882.jpg|thumb|''Rosedale in 1882'' by Anne Langton]]\n\nIn 1833, Anne's brother John, after graduating from Cambridge, emigrated to Upper Canada and the family moved into a smaller house in Bootle.  By this time, nearing 30 years of age, Anne had not married and was experiencing hearing loss.  By 1836, Anne's brother William had become a very successful [[Manchester]] businessman and he offered to pay his family's living expenses to enable them to stay in England, but the next year the family decided to join John Langdon in [[Canada]].\n\nAnne, her parents, and a maiden aunt, departed from Liverpool on May 24, 1837 and arrived in New York three weeks later.  Their land journey through [[Toronto]] to  arrived [[Peterborough, Ontario]] took nearly two months, due to sightseeing at New York and [[Niagara Falls]], visiting, and several illnesses on the way.

She designed the [[Christopher Columbus]] sculpture at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].\n\n==Life==\nLawrence was born in [[New York City]] into a prominent New York family whose ancestors included [[John Lawrence (New York)|John Lawrence]], mayor of New York City from 1673\u20131675 and 1691\u20131692, and the War of 1812 patriot, Captain James Lawrence who died after uttering the words, \"Tell the men to fire faster! Don't give up the ship!\"\n\nWhile in [[Chicago]] preparing for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], sculptor [[Augustus St. Gaudens]] recommended Lawrence, who had been a pupil of his at the Art Students League for the past five years, for the task of creating the monumental statue of [[Christopher Columbus]] that was to be placed at the entrance of the Administration Building. Like many of the buildings at the Exposition, the statue was made of [[Staff (building material)|staff]], a temporary building material, and no longer exists.<ref>[http://www.vanderkrogt.net/statues/object.php?webpage=CO&record=usil10 Columbus Monuments Pages]</ref> Although some critics claimed that St. Gaudens, or his brother Louis, had in fact modelled the work, St. Gaudens himself debunked this by stating in his Reminiscences that Lawrence, \"modeled and executed it and to her goes all the credit for the vitality and breadth of treatment which it revealed.\"<ref>Saint-Gaudens, Augustus, \u2018\u2019The Reminiscences of Augustus Saint-Gaudens\u2019\u2019, edited and amplified by Homer Stain-Gaudens, C netury Co.

Vol. 2 p. 73</ref>\n\nSt Gaudens biographer Bruce Wilkens relates that [[Francis Davis Millet|Millet]] objected to the prominent placement of the statue and arranged to have it moved to a spot near the train station. The architect [[Charles Follen McKim]], a founding member of the prestigious architectural firm [[McKim, Mead and White]] and a widower, who had fallen in love with Lawrence in New York, had enough sway in Chicago to get the statue of Columbus returned to its former place. Lawrence never forgave Millet and is quoted as saying, \"I could stamp on his face and grind it into the gravel until it bled.\"<ref name=\"Wilkinson\">Wilkinson, Bruce, photographs by David Finn,  ''Uncommon Clay: The Life and Works of Augustus Saint Gaudens'', Harcourt Brace Jonanvich, Publishers, San Diego 1985</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of the Exposition Lawrence served as an assistant to St Gaudens, helping him in the creation of the General [[John A. Logan]] monument that was bound for [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in Chicago. Thereafter, she moved to Paris where she studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]]. There, in 1893, she met a young assistant to [[Frederick William Macmonnies]], Francois ML Tonetti. They were married in 1900 in New York City. Saint Gaudens, when he heard about the wedding \"broke down and wept\"<ref name=\"Wilkinson\"/> and bemoaned the loss of her artistic ability to a much less talented sculptor, saying that she would likely have \"lots of festive children,\" but would produce no more significant art.\n\nLawrence did produce a few more works after her marriage, such as two fountains she created with her husband for the [[Pan-American Exposition]] held in Buffalo, New York in 1901. In 1907, she contributed two statues, ''Venice'' and ''Spain'' - again in collaboration with her husband - to the parade of statues on the cornice of [[Cass Gilbert]]'s US Customs House.\n\nLawrence Tonetti was one of the founders of New York's Cosmopolitan Club.  As a supporter of the arts, she helped form an artists' colony at her ancestral home of Sneden's Landing, New York, now called  [[Palisades, New York]].<ref>Savell, Isabell K. (1977).

July 4, 1844 \u2013 September 17, 1907) was an American sculptor who worked for most of her career in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. She is the first woman of [[African-American]] and Native American heritage to achieve international fame and recognition as a sculptor in the fine arts world. Her work is known for incorporating themes relating to black and American Indian people into Neoclassical style sculpture. By the end of the 19th century, she was the only black woman who had participated in and been recognized to any degree by the American artistic mainstream. She emerged during the crisis-filled days of the Civil War. In 2002, the scholar [[Molefi Kete Asante]] listed Edmonia Lewis on his list of ''[[100 Greatest African Americans]]''.<ref>Asante, Molefi Kete (2002).

Her mother's two sisters then adopted both Lewis and her older brother Samuel, who was born in 1832. The children remained with their aunts near Niagara Falls for about the next four years. Lewis and her aunts sold Ojibwe baskets and other souvenirs, such as moccasins and blouses, to tourists visiting [[Niagara Falls]], [[Toronto]], and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. During this time, Lewis went by her Native American name, Wildfire, while her brother was called Sunshine. In 1852 Samuel left for California, leaving Lewis in the care of a Captain S. R. Mills, although he continuously sent back money for her board and education. Later, in 1856, Lewis was enrolled at [[New York Central College, McGrawville]], which was a Baptist abolitionist school.<ref name=\"Buick 4\">{{cite book|last1=Buick|first1=Kirsten Pai|title=Child of the Fire: Mary Edmonia Lewis and the Problem of Art History's Black and Indian Subject|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|page=4}}</ref> During her summer term there in 1858, Lewis took classes in the Primary Department in order to prepare for courses she would later take in collegiate programs. In a later interview, Lewis claimed she remained at the school for three years but left when she was \"declared to be wild\".<ref name=\"Buick p.5\">{{cite book|last1=Buick|first1=|title=Child of the Fire|date=2010|publisher=|location=|page=5}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nIn 1859, with help from her brother Samuel and abolitionists, Lewis was sent at the age of about 15 to [[Oberlin College]], where she changed her name to Mary Edmonia Lewis.<ref name=Hartigan/><ref name=\"Buick p.5\"/> At the time, Oberlin College was one of the first higher learning institutions in the United States to admit women and people of differing ethnicities. Lewis's decision to attend Oberlin was one that would significantly change her life, as that is where she began her art studies.<ref name=plowden>Plowden, Martha W. \"Edmonia Lewis-Sculptor\", ''Famous Firsts of Black Women''. Gretna: Pelican Company, 1994.</ref> Lewis boarded with Reverend [[John Keep]] and his wife from 1859 until she left the college in 1863. Reverend Keep was white and a member of the board of trustees, but was also an avid abolitionist and spokesperson for coeducation.<ref name=\"Buick p.5\" /> During the 1859-60 school year, Lewis enrolled in the Young Ladies' Preparatory Department, which was designed \"to give Young Ladies facilities for the thorough mental discipline, and the special training which will qualify them for teaching and other duties of their sphere.\"<ref name=\"Buick 7\">{{cite book|last1=Buick|first1=Kirsten|title=Child of the Fire: Mary Edmonia Lewis and the Problem of Art History's Black and Indian Subject|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|page=7}}</ref>\n\nDuring the winter season of 1862, several months after the start of the Civil War, while Edmonia Lewis was attending Oberlin College, an incident involved her and two classmates, Maria Miles and Christina Ennes. The three women, who boarded in the home of Oberlin trustee John Keep, planned to go sleigh riding with some young men later that day. Before the sleighing, Lewis served her friends a drink of spiced wine. Shortly after, Miles and Ennes fell severely ill. Doctors examined them and concluded that the two women had some sort of poison in their system, apparently [[cantharides]], a reputed aphrodisiac. For a time it was not certain that they would survive. Days later, it became apparent that the two women would recover from the incident, and, because of their recovery, the authorities initially took no action.\n\nThe incident became quite controversial, spreading around Ohio rapidly. The townspeople of Oberlin did not hold the same progressive views of the college. Prior to her six-day long trial, anti-abolitionist vigilantes physically assaulted Lewis. While she was walking home alone one night, she was dragged into an open field by unknown assailants and badly beaten.<ref name=katz>Katz, William L., and Paula A.

[[John Mercer Langston]], an Oberlin College alumnus, and the only practicing African-American lawyer in Oberlin, represented Lewis during her trial. Although most witnesses spoke against her and she did not testify, the jury acquitted her of the charges.<ref name=katz/>\n\nThe remainder of Lewis' time at Oberlin was marked with isolation and prejudice. About a year after the trial, Lewis was accused of stealing artists' materials from the college. Even though she was acquitted due to lack of evidence, she was forbidden from registering for her last term by the principal of the Young Ladies' Course, Marianne Dascomb, which prevented Lewis from graduating.<ref name=\"Buick 10\">{{cite book|last1=Buick|first1=|title=Child of the Fire|date=2010|publisher=|location=|page=10}}</ref>\n\n==Art career==\n\n===Boston===\n[[File:Edmonia lewis minnehaha.jpg|thumb|''[[Minnehaha]]'', marble, 1868, collection of the [[Newark Museum]]]]\nAfter college, Lewis moved to [[Boston]] in early 1864, where she began to pursue her career as a sculptor.

Her subjects in 1863 and 1864 included some of the most famous abolitionists of her day: John Brown and Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]].<ref name=\"Buick 13\" /> When she met Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the commander of an [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|African American Civil War regiment]] from Massachusetts, she was inspired to create a bust of his likeness, which impressed the Shaw family, who purchased her homage.<ref>Wolfe 46\u201349.</ref> Lewis then made plaster cast reproductions of the bust, of which she sold one hundred of at 15 dollars apiece.<ref name=\"Buick 14\">{{cite book|last1=Buick|first1=|title=Child of the Fire|date=2010|publisher=|location= |page=14}}</ref> Anna Quincy Waterston, a poet, then wrote a poem about both Lewis and Shaw.<ref>Wolfe 49.</ref>\n\nFrom 1864 to 1871, Lewis was written about or interviewed by [[Lydia Maria Child]], [[Elizabeth Peabody]], Anna Quincy Waterston, and [[Laura Curtis Bullard]].

She was not opposed to the coverage she received in the abolitionist press, and she was not known to deny monetary aid, but she could not tolerate the false praise.

Lewis also drew inspiration from [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and his work, particularly his epic poem ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]''. She made several busts of its leading characters, for which he drew from Ojibwe legend.\n\n===Rome===\nThe success and popularity of these works in Boston allowed Lewis to bear the cost of a trip to Rome in 1866.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=|title=Women, Art, and Society|date=2012|publisher=|location=|page=224|edition=Fifth}}</ref>  On her 1865 passport is written, \"M.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003.</ref>\n\nLewis was unique in the way she approached sculpting abroad. She insisted on enlarging her clay and wax models in marble herself, rather than hire native Italian sculptors to do it for her, which was the common practice. Male sculptors were largely skeptical of the talent of female sculptors, and often accused them of not doing their own work.<ref name=\"Buick\">{{cite book|last1=Buick|first1=|title=Child of the Fire|date=2010|publisher=|location=}}</ref> [[Harriet Hosmer]], a fellow sculptor and expatriate, also did this. Lewis also was known to make sculptures before receiving commissions for them, or sent unrequested works to Boston patrons requesting that they raise funds for materials and shipping.<ref name=\"Chadwick 30\" />\n\nHer work sold for large sums of money. In 1873 an article in the ''[[New Orleans Picayune]]'' stated: \"Edmonia Lewis had snared two 50,000&nbsp;dollar commissions.\" Her new-found popularity made her studio a tourist destination.<ref name=tufts>Tufts, Eleanor. \"The Nineteenth Century\", ''Our Hidden Heritage.''

In ''Death of Cleopatra'', Edmonia Lewis added an innovative flair by portraying the Egyptian queen in a disheveled, inelegant manner, a departure from the Victorian approach of representing death.<ref>Nelson 168.</ref> Although her white contemporaries were also sculpting Cleopatra and other comparable subject matter (such as Harriet Hosmer\u2019s ''Zenobia''), Lewis was more prone to scrutiny than them on the premise of race and gender due to the fact that she, like Cleopatra, was black and female:\n\n\"The associations between Cleopatra and a black Africa were so profound that\u2026 any depiction of the ancient Egyptian queen had to contend with the issue of her race and the potential expectation of her blackness. Lewis\u2019 white queen gained the aura of historical accuracy through primary research without sacrificing its symbolic links to abolitionism, black Africa, or black diaspora. But what is refused to facilitate was the racial objectification of the artist\u2019s body. Lewis could not so readily become the subject of her own representation if her subject was corporeally white.\" <ref>Nelson, 178.</ref>\n\nAfter being placed in storage, the statue was moved to the 1878 Chicago Interstate Exposition where it remained unsold. The Sculpture was acquired by a gambler by the name of \"Blind John\" Condon who purchased it from a saloon on Clark street to mark the grave of a Racehorse named \"Cleopatra\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Edmonia Lewis|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Edmonia_Lewis.aspx|work=Encyclopedia of World Biology|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>  The grave was in front of the grandstand of his Harlem race track in the Chicago suburb of [[Forest Park, Illinois|Forest Park]], where it remained until it was moved to a construction storage yard in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]].  While at the storage yard, ''The Death of Cleopatra'' sustained extensive damage at the hands of well-meaning Boy Scouts who painted and caused other damage to the sculpture. Dr. James Orland, a dentist in Forest Park, and member of the Forest Park Historical Society acquired the sculpture and held it in private storage at the Forest Park Mall.\n\nLater, Marilyn Richardson, an independent curator and scholar of African-American art who was working on a biography of Lewis, went searching for ''The Death of Cleopatra''.  Richardson was directed to the Forest Park Historical Society and Dr. Orland by the Metropolitan Museum of Art who had earlier been contacted by the historical society regarding the sculpture. Richardson, after confirming the sculpture's location, contacted African-American bibliographer [[Dorothy Porter Wesley]] and the two gained the attention of [[National Museum of American Art|NMAA]]'s George Gurney.<ref name=May>{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=Stephen|title=The Object at Hand|journal=Smithsonian|date=September 1996|page=20}}</ref> According to Gurney, Curator Emeritus at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]],<ref name=\"gurney\">Kaplan, Howard, [http://eyelevel.si.edu/2011/09/sculpting-a-career-with-curator-george-gurney.html \"Sculpting a Career with Curator George Gurney\"], Eye Level Blog, Smithsonian American Art Museum, September 29, 2011, accessed December 7, 2012.</ref> the sculpture was in a race track in Forest Park, Illinois, during [[World War II]], sitting on top of the  Finally, the sculpture became under the purview of the Forest Park Historical Society, who donated it to [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] in 1994,<ref>[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=33878 Museum catalog record for ''The Death of Cleopatra''] on the Smithsonian American Art Museum website, accessed December 7, 2012.</ref> Chicago based Andrezej Dajnowski in conjunction with the Smithsonian restored it to its near-original state after repairing the nose,sandles, hands, chin, and extensive \"sugaring\" at at cost of around $30,000.<ref name=May/>\n\nA testament to Lewis's renown as an artist came in 1877, when former US President [[Ulysses S.

Thursday, July 25, 1895, p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1880s, the neoclassism declined in popularity, as did the popularity of Lewis's artwork. She continued sculpting in marble, increasingly creating altarpieces and other works for [[Roman Catholic]] patrons.In the art world, she became eclipsed by history and lost fame. By 1901 she had moved to London.<ref>The 1901 British census lists her as lodging at 37 Store Street, Holborn, supported by \"own means\". She gives her age as 59, her occupation as \"Artist (modeller)\", and her birthplace as \"India\".</ref> The events of her later years are not known.<ref name=plowden/>\n\n===Race and Reception===\nAs an artist of color, Edmonia Lewis had to be hyperconscious of her stylistic choices because her largely white audience often gravely misread her work as self-portraiture. In order to avoid this, her female figures typically possess Eurocentric features.<ref name=\"Nelson\"/> Lewis had to balance her own personal identity with her artistic, social, and national identify, a tiring activity that affected her art <ref name=\"Kleeblatt,1\">{{cite book|last1=Kleeblatt|first1=Norman L.|title=Master Narratives Minority Artists|date=1998}}</ref> She had to meet the expectations of art world while avoiding being pigeon-holed into the inescapable categories of being just an \"artist of color\" or a \"lady sculptor\".\n\n\"It is hard to overstate the visual incongruity of the black-Native female body, let alone that identity in a sculptor, within the Roman colony. As the first black-Native sculptor of either sex to achieve international recognition within a western sculptural tradition, Lewis was a symbolic and social anomaly within a dominantly white bourgeois and aristocratic community.\" <ref name=\"Nelson\"/>\n\n==Family==\nLewis never married and had no known children.<ref name=perry>Perry, Regenia A. \"Edmonia Lewis\", ''Free Within Ourselves''. Washington D.C.: National Museum of American Art, 1992.</ref> Her brother Samuel became a barber in [[San Francisco]], eventually moving to mining camps in [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]]. In 1868, he settled in the city of [[Bozeman, Montana]], where he set up a barber shop on Main Street. He prospered, eventually investing in commercial real estate, and subsequently built his own home which still stands at 308 South Bozeman Avenue. In 1999 the [[Samuel Lewis House (Bozeman, Montana)|Samuel Lewis House]] was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. In 1884, he married Mrs. Melissa Railey Bruce, a widow with six children. The couple had one son, Samuel E. Lewis (1886\u20131914), who married but died childless. The elder Lewis died after \"a short illness\" in 1896 and is buried in [[Sunset Hills Cemetery]] in Bozeman.<ref>Pickett, Mary.

Wrapped around his left wrist is a chain; however, this chain is not restraining him. To his right is a woman kneeling with her hands held in a prayer position. The man\u2019s right hand is gently placed on her right shoulder. ''Forever Free'' represents the emancipation of African-American slaves after the Civil War, a celebration of black liberation, salvation, and redemption. Lewis attempted to break stereotypes of African-American women with this sculpture. For example, she portrayed the woman as completely dressed while the man was partially dressed. This drew attention away from the notion of African-American women being sexual figures. This sculpture also symbolizes the end of the Civil War. While African Americans were legally free, they continued to be restrained, shown by the fact that the couple had chains wrapped around their bodies. The representation of race and gender has been critiqued by modern scholars, particularly the Eurocentric features of the female figure.

New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 2002.</ref>\n\n''Hagar'', 1868<br/>\nInspired by a character from the Old Testament, this was made of white marble. It shows [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] with her hands in prayer and staring slightly up but not straight across. Hagar was the handmaid or slave of Abraham's wife [[Sarah]]. Being unable to conceive a child, Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham so that he could have a son by her. Hagar gave birth to Abraham's firstborn son [[Ishmael]]. After Sarah gave birth to her own son [[Isaac]], she resented Hagar and made Abraham \"cast Hagar into the wilderness\". Lewis uses Hagar to symbolize the African mother in the United States. She represented the abuse of African women. Lewis had a tendency to sculpt historically strong women, as demonstrated not just in ''Hagar'' but also in Lewis's ''Cleopatra'' piece. Lewis also depicted regular women in great situations, emphasizing their strength.<ref name=perry/>\n\n''Old Arrow-Maker and his Daughter'', 1866<br/>\nThis sculpture was inspired by Lewis's Native American heritage. An arrow-maker and his daughter sit on a round base. They are dressed in traditional Native American clothes and the male figure has recognizable Native American facial features.

In 1875 the family moved to [[Peterborough]]. She attended the [[Royal College of Art]] which was at that time called the [[South Kensington School of Art|National Art Training School]] in [[South Kensington]]. She won the Queen's Prize in 1882 and the National Silver Medal in 1883, after which she visited Paris with a view to continuing her education. Two previous graduates of the ''National Art Training School'' - Amy Singer and Emily Fawcett - were already living in Paris, and sharing a studio with the young [[Camille Claudel]]. In January 1884 Camille's mother wrote to Jessie confirming the arrangement that Jessie would lodge with the Claudel family for 200 francs a month.\n\nIn 1886 Jessie and Camille travelled together to England where they visited Jessie's family in Peterborough.  At this time Jessie was exhibiting a terra-cotta bust ''Day Dreams'' (1886) in the Royal Academy, and in [[Nottingham]].\n\nLipscomb's relationship to Claudel soured and Claudel claimed never to want to see Lipscomb again. However, Lipscomb was one of the few people to visit Claudel many years later when the latter was confined in the Montdevergues Asylum.\n\n==Sculpture==\nIn 1887 she exhibited another terra-cotta piece entitled ''Sans Souci'', and a plaster portrait of [[Camille Claudel]].  That year she also exhibited a bust of the Italian model ''Giganti'' in both the Royal Academy and Nottingham.\n\n==Personal life==\nShe married William Elborne on 26 December 1887 and they settled in [[Manchester]].\n\n==References==\n* ''Camille Claudel: A Life'' by Odile Ayral-Clause\n* ''{{lang|fr|Correspondence}}'' by [[Camille Claudel]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/conway/16879ef3.html Some of her sculptures]\n* [http://www.musee-rodin.fr/images/imagra/Ph1442.jpg A photograph] taken by her of [[Auguste Rodin]] and his [[The Gates of Hell]]\n\n{{New Woman (late 19th century)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lipscomb, Jessie}}\n[[Category:1861 births]]\n[[Category:1952 deaths]]\n[[Category:English women sculptors]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Art]]\n[[Category:People from Grantham]]\n[[Category:20th-century British sculptors]]\n[[Category:19th-century British sculptors]]\n[[Category:19th-century women artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century women artists]]\n\n\n{{UK-sculptor-stub}}"}]},"38172055":{"pageid":38172055,"ns":0,"title":"Mary Lloyd (sculptor)"},"44297401":{"pageid":44297401,"ns":0,"title":"Kirsten Lockenwitz"},"31037306":{"pageid":31037306,"ns":0,"title":"Marie L\u00f8kke"},"39113733":{"pageid":39113733,"ns":0,"title":"Amy Londoner"},"49637145":{"pageid":49637145,"ns":0,"title":"Jeanette Shepperd Harrison Loop"},"17286653":{"pageid":17286653,"ns":0,"title":"Henriette Lorimier"},"8370650":{"pageid":8370650,"ns":0,"title":"S\u00e9raphine Louis"},"31890438":{"pageid":31890438,"ns":0,"title":"Christine L\u00f8vmand"},"15169290":{"pageid":15169290,"ns":0,"title":"Mary Fairchild MacMonnies Low"},"45619115":{"pageid":45619115,"ns":0,"title":"Marie Seymour Lucas"},"28237976":{"pageid":28237976,"ns":0,"title":"Bertha Lum"},"9324114":{"pageid":9324114,"ns":0,"title":"Am\u00e9lie Lundahl"},"38423577":{"pageid":38423577,"ns":0,"title":"Agnes Lunn"},"42420274":{"pageid":42420274,"ns":0,"title":"Adelia Armstrong Lutz"},"11318543":{"pageid":11318543,"ns":0,"title":"Vilma Lwoff-Parlaghy"},"46299259":{"pageid":46299259,"ns":0,"title":"Jessie Macgregor"},"40342213":{"pageid":40342213,"ns":0,"title":"Florence MacKubin"},"6860991":{"pageid":6860991,"ns":0,"title":"Carol Brooks MacNeil"},"44637602":{"pageid":44637602,"ns":0,"title":"Bessie MacNicol"},"40891548":{"pageid":40891548,"ns":0,"title":"Mary Lizzie Macomber"},"41814380":{"pageid":41814380,"ns":0,"title":"Catherine Madox Brown"},"47892819":{"pageid":47892819,"ns":0,"title":"Dorothea Maetzel-Johannsen"},"41519573":{"pageid":41519573,"ns":0,"title":"Francesca Magliani"},"41400632":{"pageid":41400632,"ns":0,"title":"Lilla Maldura"},"22381013":{"pageid":22381013,"ns":0,"title":"Charlotta Malm-Reuterholm"},"10726642":{"pageid":10726642,"ns":0,"title":"Katharine Emma Maltwood"},"29335129":{"pageid":29335129,"ns":0,"title":"Amalie M\u00e1nesov\u00e1"},"16711285":{"pageid":16711285,"ns":0,"title":"Julie Manet"},"41612248":{"pageid":41612248,"ns":0,"title":"Ada Mangilli"},"47242128":{"pageid":47242128,"ns":0,"title":"Mary Manning"},"49662921":{"pageid":49662921,"ns":0,"title":"Marie Antoinette Marcotte"},"41685720":{"pageid":41685720,"ns":0,"title":"Clementina Marcovigi"},"42232795":{"pageid":42232795,"ns":0,"title":"Kathleen Marescaux"},"41872476":{"pageid":41872476,"ns":0,"title":"Virginia Mariani"},"19020858":{"pageid":19020858,"ns":0,"title":"Therese Maron"},"30792205":{"pageid":30792205,"ns":0,"title":"Ana Marija Marovi\u0107"},"45711131":{"pageid":45711131,"ns":0,"title":"Madeline Marrable"},"49966253":{"pageid":49966253,"ns":0,"title":"Martha Stettler"},"45603616":{"pageid":45603616,"ns":0,"title":"Edith Martineau"},"39113863":{"pageid":39113863,"ns":0,"title":"Jacqueline Marval"},"42302586":{"pageid":42302586,"ns":0,"title":"Luigia Massari"},"41960646":{"pageid":41960646,"ns":0,"title":"Giulia Masucci Fava"}}}}
